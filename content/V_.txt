fiscal year 2022 key statistics 

1 please see item 7–management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap financial results 

our core business 

in an example of a typical visa c2b payment transaction the consumer purchases goods or services from a merchant using a visa card or payment product the merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer usually a bank or thirdparty processing firm that supports acceptance of visa cards or payment products for verification and processing through visanet the acquirer presents the transaction data to visa which in turn contacts the issuer to check the account holder’s account or credit line for authorization after the transaction is authorized the issuer effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange reimbursement fee and then posts the transaction to the consumer’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase minus the merchant discount rate mdr to the merchant 

visa earns revenue by facilitating money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers merchants financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies net revenues consist of service revenues data processing revenues international transaction revenues and other revenues minus client incentive arrangements we have with our clients we have one reportable segment which is payment services we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business 

visa is not a financial institution we do not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of visa products nor do we earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to any of these activities interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key 

table of contents 

role in balancing the costs and benefits that account holders and merchants derive from participating in our payments networks generally interchange reimbursement fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers we establish default interchange reimbursement fees that apply absent other established settlement terms in addition we do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged by acquirers for acceptance including the mdr our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants as well as establishing and earning these fees 

our net revenues in fiscal year 2022 consisted of the following

consumer payments

competition 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change existing and emerging competitors compete with visa’s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce mobile payments blockchain technology and digital currencies these advances are enabling new entrants many of which depart from traditional network payment models in certain countries the evolving regulatory landscape is creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition 

we compete against all forms of payment this includes paperbased payments primarily cash and checks and all forms of electronic payments our electronic payment competitors principally include 

global or multiregional networks these networks typically offer a range of branded general purpose card payment products that consumers can use at millions of merchant locations around the world examples include mastercard american express discover jcb and unionpay these competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the us or have a leading position in certain countries such as unionpay in china see item 1a—risk factors—regulatory risks—governmentimposed obligations andor restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china and india  based on available data visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world 

the following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2021 1

local and regional networks operated in many countries these networks often have the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial institutions or payment processors these networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the us interac in canada and eftpos in australia 

digital wallet providers they continue to expand payment capabilities in person and online for consumers and merchants while digital wallets can help drive visa volumes they can also be funded by noncard payment options 

alternative payments providers these providers such as closed commerce ecosystems bnpl solutions and cryptocurrency platforms often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels however they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale these companies may process payments using inhouse account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the ach global or local networks like visa or some combination of the foregoing in some cases these entities can be both a partner and a competitor to visa 

realtime payment rtp networks rtp networks have launched in multiple markets mainly driven by government sponsorship and regulatory intervention these networks primarily focus on domestic transactions with adoption varying by use cases and geographies they can compete with visa on consumer payments and other payment flows eg b2b and p2p but can be partners for value added services such as risk management 

payment processors we compete with payment processors for the processing of visa transactions these processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other networks processors and other third parties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

value added service and new flows providers we face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value added services as well as new flows eg visa direct and visa b2b connect this includes a wide range of players such as technology companies information services and consulting firms governments and merchant services companies regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in these areas 

we believe our fundamental value proposition of security convenience speed and reliability as well as the number of credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed in addition we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions merchants fintechs governments ngos and business organizations to provide tailored and innovative solutions we will continue to utilize our network of networks strategy to facilitate the movement of money we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of payment products new flows offerings and value added services and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably

interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer act doddfrank act limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions in the us the european union eu ifr limits interchange rates in the european economic area eea as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia and the central bank of brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange 

internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payment system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling digital currencies the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol and other controversial transaction types 

network exclusivity and routing in the us the doddfrank act limits network exclusivity and restrictions on merchant routing choice for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr’s prohibition in europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card 

nosurcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation 

privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and datahandling practices create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data 

supervisory oversight of the payments industry visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the us for example the federal banking agencies fba formerly known as the federal financial institutions examination council has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to us financial institutions the federal banking agencies comprising the fba are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration visa also may be separately examined by the consumer financial protection bureau as a service provider to the banks that issue visabranded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countriesregions including europe india ukraine and the united kingdom as discussed below have recognized or designated visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil and hong kong 

european and united kingdom regulations and supervisory oversight visa in europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the eea and the uk 

there are a number of eu regulations that impact our business as discussed above the ifr regulates interchange rates within the eea requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decisionmaking purposes within the eea and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing national competent authorities in the eea are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in their markets we are also subject to regulations governing privacy and data protection antibribery antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions other regulations in europe such as the second payment services directive psd2 require among other things that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging nonfinancial institution players psd2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences visa europe is also subject to supervisory oversight by the european central bank and other national competent authorities in europe

regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see item 1 — business —government regulation for more information  in the us and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction in the context of credit and debit transactions those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers the reverse is true for certain transactions like atm interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 

interchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example 

• regulations adopted by the us federal reserve cap the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent the doddfrank act also limits issuers’ and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacts our business in october 2022 the federal reserve published a final rule effectively requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaffiliated networks are available for routing card not present debit transactions by july 1 2023 various stakeholder groups are also advocating that the federal reserve further lower interchange fees on debit transactions and restrict the ability of payments networks to enter into certain incentive and growth agreements with issuers in addition there continues to be interest in further regulation of interchange fees 

table of contents 

and routing practices by members of congress and state legislators in the us in 2022 legislation was introduced in the us house of representatives and senate which among other things would require large issuing banks to offer a choice of at least two unaffiliated networks over which electronic credit transactions may be processed in europe the eu’s ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and crossborder transactions within the eea 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively eu member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories the european commission recently announced its intention to conduct another impact assessment of the ifr which could result in even lower caps on interchange rates and the expansion of regulation to other types of products services and fees several countries in latin america are exploring regulatory measures against payments networks and have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps including argentina brazil chile and costa rica in asia pacific the reserve bank of australia rba completed its review of the country’s payment system regulations and adopted a series of measures which include lower interchange rates for debit transactions the rba also continues to assess the potential merits of mandating cobadging and routing requirements on dual network debit cards in addition the new zealand parliament passed legislation capping domestic interchange rates for debit and credit products 

• while the focus of interchange regulation has primarily been on domestic rates historically there is increasing focus on crossborder rates in recent years for example in 2019 we settled certain crossborder interchange rates with the european commission t he uk’s psr recently initiated two market reviews one focusing on postbrexit increases in interchange rates for transactions between the uk and europe and the other focusing on increases in scheme and processing fees in the uk meanwhile costa rica became the first country to formally regulate crossborder interchange rates by direct regulation crossborder mdr is also regulated in costa rica and turkey 

• many governments including but not limited to governments in india costa rica and turkey are using regulation to further drive down mdr which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions with increased lobbying by merchants and other industry participants we are also beginning to see regulatory interest in network fees in the uk europe and chile also some countries in latin america like peru argentina and chile are also relying on antitrustdriven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate including the enforceability of important network rules relating to honor all cards or products and crossborder acquiring other countries like new zealand are adopting regulations that require us to seek government preapproval of our network rules which could also impact the way we operate in certain markets 

• government regulations or pressure may also impact our rules and practices and require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services to have the other network’s functionality or brand marks on our products or to share our intellectual property with other networks as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence for instance new products and capabilities including tokenization push payments and new flows eg visa b2b connect could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered furthermore certain of our businesses are regulated as payment institutions or as money transmitters subjecting us to various licensing supervisory and other requirements in addition the eu’s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies 

regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings for example our settlement with the european commission on crossborder interchange rates has drawn preliminary attention from some regulators in other parts of the world similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments or vice versa the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors’ closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees or reducing certain benefits to 

table of contents 

consumers which make our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher mdr regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternative payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us including reductions in the fees that we charge which directly impacts our revenues 

in addition we are also subject to central bank oversight in a growing number of countries including brazil india the uk and within the eu some countries with existing oversight frameworks are looking to further enhance their regulatory powers while regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on these regulatory principles this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally as well as localized risk management or governance increased oversight could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system 

finally policymakers and regulatory bodies in the us europe and other parts of the world are exploring ways to reform existing competition laws to meet the needs of the digital economy including restricting large technology companies from engaging in mergers and acquisitions requiring them to interoperate with potential competitors and prohibiting certain kinds of selfpreferencing behaviors while the focus of these efforts remains primarily on increasing regulation of large technology ecommerce and social media companies they could also have implications for other types of companies including payments networks which could constrain our ability to effectively manage our business 

governmentimposed obligations andor restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china and india 

governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks brands and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations to varying degrees these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments or data processing be performed entirely within that country which could prevent us from managing the endtoend processing of certain transactions 

in china unionpay remains the predominant processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the predominant domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the people’s bank of china pboc to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural steps for approval remain uncertain the approval process might take several years and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks cobadging and coresidency regulations also pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing certain banks have issued dualbranded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks the pboc is contemplating that dualbranded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china’s domestic payments market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visaonly branded cards for international travel and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license however notwithstanding such efforts the phase out of dualbranded cards have decreased our payment volumes and impacted the revenue we generate in china 

unionpay has grown rapidly in china and is actively pursuing international expansion plans which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule which requires that international transactions on visa cards be routed over visanet furthermore although regulatory barriers shield unionpay from competition in china alternative payments providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce offline and crossborder payments which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china netsunion clearing corp a chinese digital transaction routing system and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with international payments networks  

regulatory initiatives in india including a data localization mandate passed by the government that suggests growing nationalistic priorities has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with 

table of contents 

domestic payment providers furthermore any inability to meet the requirements of the data localization mandate could impact our ability to do business in india in europe with the support of the european central bank a group of european banks have announced their intent to launch a paneuropean payment system the european payments initiative or epi while epi subsequently announced a focus on accounttoaccount instant payments across a range of use cases it is noteworthy that the purported motivation behind epi is to reduce the risks of disintermediation of european providers by international technology companies and continued reliance on international payments networks for intraeurope card transactions furthermore regional groups of countries such as the gulf cooperation council gcc and a number of countries in southeast asia eg malaysia have adopted or may consider efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions the african development bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability finally some countries such as south africa are mandating onshore processing of domestic transactions geopolitical events including sanctions trade tensions or other types of activities have intensified any or all of these activities which could adversely affect our business for example in the aftermath of us and european sanctions against russia and the decision by us payments networks including visa to suspend operations in the country russia called for the brics countries a fivecountry bloc made up of brazil russia india china and south africa to lessen dependence on western payment systems by among other things integrating payment systems and cards across member countries 

finally central banks in a number of countries including those in argentina australia brazil mexico and canada are in the process of developing or expanding national rtp networks with the goal of driving a greater number of domestic transactions onto these systems similarly an increasing number of jurisdictions are exploring the concept of building central bank digital currencies for retail payments if successfully deployed these national payment platforms and digital currencies could have significant implications for visa’s domestic and crossborder payments including potential disintermediation 

due to our inability to manage the endtoend processing of transactions for cards in certain countries eg thailand we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or thirdparty service providers to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or onshore processing in general national laws that protect or otherwise support domestic providers or processing may increase our costs decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products services and innovations force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets and create new competitors all of which could harm our business 

laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us  

our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world for example in europe data protection authorities have been increasingly ruling on crossborder data transfers in the wake of the july 2020 decision from the court of justice of the european union known as schrems ii significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws that are interpreted and applied differently from country to country may have extraterritorial effects and could create inconsistent or conflicting requirements although we have a global data privacy program that addresses the requirements applicable to our international business our ongoing efforts to comply with us state privacy and cybersecurity regulations as well as rapidly emerging international privacy and data protection laws may increase the complexity of our compliance operations entail substantial expenses divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer 

furthermore inconsistent local and regional regulations restricting location movement collection use and management of data may limit our ability to innovate or compete in certain jurisdictions for example china adopted its first comprehensive privacy law the personal information protection law pipl although certain details of pipl are beginning to be clarified by the issuance of further regulatory clarification or guidance visa could be impacted more significantly if our license is approved and we begin processing domestic card transactions in china lastly enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future 

table of contents 

enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in tax laws 

we exercise significant judgment and make estimates in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service the uk’s hm revenue and customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions including unilateral actions of foreign jurisdictions to introduce digital services taxes or changes resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s program of work related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and design of a system to ensure multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax to the countries where we earn revenue may also materially affect our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

litigation risks 

we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations 

we are involved in numerous litigation matters investigations and proceedings asserted by civil litigants governments and enforcement bodies investigating or alleging among other things violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law privacy law and intellectual property law these are referred to as “actions” in this section details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report these actions are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable or reach a settlement in any action particularly in a large class action lawsuit such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the us or we incur liability arising from a government investigation we may be required to pay significant awards settlements or fines in addition settlement terms judgments orders or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by influencing or requiring us to modify among other things the default interchange reimbursement rates we set the visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules our fees or pricing or the way we do business these actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators investigators governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions which may lead to additional actions against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them even if visa is not a defendant 

for certain actions like those that are us covered litigation or ve territory covered litigation as described in note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

business risks 

we face intense competition in our industry 

the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors or methods of payment emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multiregional networks other domestic and closedloop payments systems digital wallets and alternative payments providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients other emerging payment providers such as fintechs other digital payments technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce social media and mobile channels as well as governments in a number of jurisdictions eg brazil and india as 

table of contents 

discussed above that are developing supporting andor operating national schemes rtp networks and other payment platforms 

our competitors may acquire or develop substantially better technology have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer more effective innovative or a wider range of programs products and services they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater use including with respect to issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions which could hurt our financial results and prospects 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternative payments systems like alipay and wechat pay operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the doddfrank act the ifr in europe or rtp initiatives by governments such as the us federal reserve’s fednow or the central bank of brazil’s pix system may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models and may create new competitors including in some cases the government itself similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies and platforms including mobile payments alternative payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example 

• we along with our competitors clients network participants and others are developing or participating in alternative payments systems or products such as mobile payment services ecommerce payment services p2p payment services realtime and faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ach or direct debits from or to consumer checking accounts that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value added services we provide to support such processing examples include initiatives from the clearing house an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system early warning services which operates zelle a bankoffered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or realtime payments across a variety of payment types including p2p corporate and government disbursement bill pay and deposit check transactions and cryptocurrency or stablecoinbased payments initiatives 

• many countries or regions are developing or promoting domestic networks switches and rtp systems eg us india and europe to the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions prohibit international payments networks like visa from participating on those systems andor impose restrictions or prohibitions on international payments networks from offering payment services on such transactions we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries for example in argentina the government has mandated local acquirers to use debit card credentials to initiate payment transactions on a governmentsponsored national rtp system furthermore in some regions eg southeast asia and the middle east through intergovernmental organizations such as the association of southeast asian nations and the gcc some countries are looking into crossborder connectivity of such domestic systems 

• parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain 

• parties that access our payment credentials tokens and technologies including clients technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate or steer account holders and other clients to alternative 

table of contents 

payment methods or use our payment credentials tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms 

• participants in the payments industry may merge form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new competing payment services and 

• new or revised industry standards related to online checkout and web payments cloudbased payments tokenization or other paymentsrelated technologies set by individual countries regions or organizations such as the international organization for standardization american national standards institute world wide web consortium european card standards group pci co nexo and emvco may result in additional costs and expenses for visa and its clients or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services 

as the competitive landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses products services and practices we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth 

our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and develop 

our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue nonvisa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition for more information please see note 14—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

in addition we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients in order to stay competitive we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments adapt to regulatory changes and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include upfront cash payments fee discounts rebates credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants and acquirers to win routing preference in relation to other network options or forms of payment market pressures on pricing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits 

in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or cobrand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 

merchants’ and processors’ continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the use and acceptance of visa products certain merchants and merchantaffiliated groups have been exerting their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions such as the us canada and europe to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory intervention filing lawsuits and in some cases surcharging or refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased 

table of contents 

compliance and litigation expenses issuers may decrease their issuance of our products and consumer usage of our products could be adversely impacted for example in the us certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and the cost of payment card acceptance in addition to ongoing litigation related to the us migration to emvcapable cards and pointofsale terminals us merchantaffiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process and some policymakers have expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council in the development of payment card standards additionally some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transactions to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers’ usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement andor litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business 

we depend on relationships with financial institutions acquirers processors merchants payment facilitators ecommerce platforms fintechs and other third parties 

as noted above our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for instance we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace we provide incentives to merchants acquirers ecommerce platforms and processors to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we also engage in many payment card cobranding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem whether as for example an issuer merchant ecommerce platform or digital wallet provider as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships in addition we depend on our clients and third parties including network partners vendors and suppliers to submit facilitate and process transactions properly provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and otherwise adhere to our operating rules and applicable laws to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their visabranded payment products which could harm our business and reputation 

our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation or if we experience brand disintermediation 

our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business we believe that our clients and their account holders associate our brand with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause brand disintermediation at the point of sale and decrease the presence of our brand our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including authorization clearing and settlement service disruptions data security breaches compliance failures by visa including by our employees agents clients partners or suppliers failure to meet our environmental social and governance goals or our stakeholders’ expectations negative perception of our industry the industries of our clients visaaccepting merchants or our clients’ customers including third party payments providers illperceived actions or affiliations by clients partners or other third parties such as sponsorship or cobrand partners and fraudulent or illegal activities using our payment products our brand could also be negatively impacted when our products are used to facilitate payment for legal but controversial products and services including but not limited to adult content cryptocurrencies firearms and gambling activities additionally these risks could be exacerbated if our financial institution partners andor merchants fail to maintain necessary controls to ensure the legality of these transactions if any legal liability associated with such goods or services is extended to ancillary participants in the value chain like payments networks or if our network and industry become entangled in political or social debates concerning such legal but controversial commerce if we are unable to maintain our reputation the value of our

brand may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients account holders employees prospective employees governments and the public as well as impact our business 

global economic political market health and social events or conditions including the war in ukraine and the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic may harm our business 

more than half of our net revenues are earned outside the us international crossborder transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by economic political market health and social events or conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions within the us or internationally including but not limited to recessions inflation rising interest rates high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures rising energy prices or a slowdown of global trade and reduced consumer small business government and corporate spending have a direct impact on our volumes transactions and revenues furthermore in efforts to deal with adverse macroeconomic conditions governments may introduce new or additional initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payment fees or other costs in an overall soft global economy such pricing measures could result in additional financial pressures on our business 

in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics like covid19 or other local or global health issues political uncertainties international hostilities armed conflict war such as the ongoing war in ukraine civil unrest climaterelated events including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events impacts to the power grid and natural disasters have to varying degrees negatively impacted our operations clients thirdparty suppliers activities and crossborder travel and spend the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties including the transmissibility and severity of new variants of the virus the uptake and effectiveness of actions that are taken by governments businesses or individuals in response to the pandemic the impact of the reopening of borders and resumption of international travel the indirect impact of the pandemic on global economic activity and the impact on our employees and our operations the business of our clients suppliers and business partners in addition a number of countries took steps during the pandemic to temporarily cap interchange or other fees on electronic payments as part of their covid19 economic relief measures while most have been rescinded or have expired it is possible that proponents of interchange andor mdr regulation may try to position government intervention as necessary to support potential future economic relief initiatives 

geopolitical trends towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions tariffs or trade restrictions also limit the expansion of our business in certain regions and have resulted in us suspending our operations in other regions as a result of us and european sanctions against russia we suspended our operations in russia in march 2022 and are no longer generating revenue from domestic and crossborder activities related to russia for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 total net revenues from russia including revenues driven by domestic as well as crossborder activities were approximately 2 and 4 of our consolidated net revenues respectively all transactions initiated with visa cards issued by financial institutions outside russia no longer work within russia and all transactions on cards issued by financial institutions in russia may be processed on a domestic network unrelated to visa and no longer work outside the country the war in ukraine and any further actions by or in response to such actions by russia or its allies could have lasting impacts on ukraine as well as other regional and global economies any or all of which could adversely affect our business 

a decline in economic political market health and social conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions could reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which would ultimately impact our revenues our clients may implement costreduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital 

finally as governments investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental governance and social topics governments are implementing regulations and investors and other stakeholders are imposing new expectations or focusing investments in ways that may cause significant shifts in disclosure commerce and consumption behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business as a result of any of these factors any decline in crossborder travel and spend would 

table of contents 

impact our crossborder volumes the number of crossborder transactions we process and our currency exchange activities which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues 

our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity 

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa operating rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa card payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions changes in the credit standing of our clients or concurrent settlement failures or insolvencies involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures could expose us to liquidity risk and negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure or insolvency we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

failure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth 

the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including increased proliferation of mobile and other proximity and inapp payment technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrencies distributed ledger and blockchain technologies cloudbased encryption and authorization and new authentication technologies such as biometrics fido 20 3d secure 20 and dynamic cardholder verification values or dcvv2 as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve including those developed by visa such as our new flows offerings in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated moreover some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or claims potentially impacting our development efforts andor requiring us to obtain licenses implement design changes or discontinue our use if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients impact our intellectual property or licensing rights harm our business and impact our future growth 

a disruption failure or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our business 

our cybersecurity and processing systems as well as those of financial institutions merchants and thirdparty service providers have experienced and may continue to experience errors interruptions delays or damage from a number of causes including power outages hardware software and network failures computer viruses ransomware malware or other destructive software internal design manual or user errors cyberattacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters severe weather conditions and other effects from climate change in addition there is risk that third party suppliers of hardware and infrastructure required to operate our data centers and support employee productivity could be impacted by supply chain disruptions such as manufacturing shipping delays and service disruption due to cyberattacks an extended supply chain or service disruption could also impact processing or delivery of technology services 

furthermore our visibility and role in the global payments industry also puts our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts for example in response to us and european sanctions against russia earlier this year we saw increased cyberthreats from state sponsored or nationstate actors we have been and may continue to be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions merchants and thirdparty service providers we are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data

security breaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders given the increase in online banking ecommerce and other online activity as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continue to see increased cyber and payment fraud activity as cybercriminals attempt ddos related attacks phishing and social engineering scams and other disruptive actions overall such attacks and breaches have resulted and may continue to result in fraudulent activity and ultimately financial losses to visa’s clients 

numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks targeted attacks against our employees and trusted partners ie insider threats phishing and social engineering schemes particularly on our internetfacing applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our thirdparty service providers because the tactics techniques and procedures used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the security measures and procedures we our financial institution and merchant clients other merchants and thirdparty service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches cyberattacks or system failures in some cases the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards who may not be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or fix security defects or whose hardware software or network services may be subject to error defect delay outage or lack appropriate malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exfiltration incidents despite our security measures and programs to protect our systems and data and prevent detect and respond to data security incidents there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats 

these events could significantly disrupt our operations impact our clients and consumers damage our reputation and brand result in litigation or claims violations of applicable privacy and other laws and increased regulatory review or scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties result in damages or changes to our business practices decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products decrease our volume revenues and future growth prospects and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise 

structural and organizational risks

we may be unable to attract hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce including key management 

the talents and efforts of our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry especially in fintech technology and other specialized areas is extremely competitive our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract hire or retain other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration travel and work authorizations have made it more difficult for employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which we have operations and could continue to impair our ability to attract hire and retain qualified employees failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent especially in light of evolving health and safety protocols resulting from the covid19 pandemic and changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture including increasing the number of underrepresented employees in the us to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team to maintain our strong corporate culture of fostering innovation collaboration and inclusion in our current hybrid model or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could impact our workforce development goals impact our ability to achieve our business objectives and adversely affect our business and our future success 

the conversions of our class b and class c common stock or series a b and c preferred stock into shares of class a common stock would result in voting dilution to and could impact the market price of our existing class a common stock

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

• provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios 

• ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities 

• ensure payments on required litigation settlements 

• make planned capital investments in our business 

• pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and 

• invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs and earn additional income 

based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlements in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions in general during fiscal 2022 we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital as of september 30 2022 we held 92 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs see note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

table of contents 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into longterm incentive agreements with financial institution clients merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume increasing visa product acceptance winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance these estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using clientreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients merchants and business partners 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual performance is not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2022 client incentives represented 26 of gross revenues 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss if any in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a loss is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and based on a number of factors including management’s understanding of the legal or regulatory profile and the specifics of each proceeding our history with similar matters advice of internal and external legal counsel and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

we have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation however our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plan’s mechanisms include the use of the us litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the us litigation escrow account balance our europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liabilities and losses relating to the covered period subject to certain limitations and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the european commission proceedings or any other matter see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable see note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

table of contents 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions based on our interpretation of local tax laws we also inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated nonfunctional currency denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

at september 30 2022 and 2021 the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 34 billion and 27 billion respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2022 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast at september 30 2022 the effect of a hypothetical 10 weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of approximately 220 million on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts the loss from this hypothetical weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currencydenominated revenues and payments see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 13—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of visa europe is the euro translation from the euro to the us dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10 change in the euro against the us dollar compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2022 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 18 billion 

we designated a portion of our eurodenominated senior notes as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment in visa europe as of september 30 2022 changes in the value of the designated portion of the eurodenominated senior notes attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the eurodenominated net investment are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the company’s consolidated balance sheets see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 13—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

table of contents 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income 

at september 30 2022 and 2021 the fair value of our fixedrate investment securities were 53 billion and 55 billion respectively and the fair value of our adjustablerate investment securities were not material and 02 billion respectively at september 30 2022 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 47 million any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity 

we have interest rate and crosscurrency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our us dollar denominated fixedrate payments into us dollar and euro denominated floatingrate payments by entering into interest rate swaps we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately 40 million in annual interest expense see note 13—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

equity investment risk 

our equity investments are held in both marketable and nonmarketable equity securities the marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and the nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies 

as of september 30 2022 and 2021 the carrying value of our marketable equity securities was 291 million and 323 million respectively these securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings 

as of september 30 2022 and 2021 the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities was 12 billion and 15 billion respectively these investments are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our holdings a decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies we regularly review our nonmarketable equity securities for possible impairment which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs and the viability of its business model 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2022 and 2021 our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 10 billion and 13 billion respectively and projected benefit obligations were 07 billion and 09 billion respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding as of september 30 2022 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 150 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 32 million in pension cost 

at september 30 2022 and 2021 our nonus defined benefit pension plan assets were 03 billion and 05 billion respectively and projected benefit obligations were 03 billion and 05 billion respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding as of september 30 2022 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 82 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 11 million in pension cost 

we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2023 if any which would be made in september 2023

fiscal year 2021 key statistics 

1 please see item 7–management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap financial results 

our core business 

in an example of a typical visa c2b payment transaction the consumer purchases goods or services from a merchant using a visa card or payment product the merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer usually a bank or thirdparty processing firm that supports acceptance of visa cards or payment products for verification and processing through visanet the acquirer presents the transaction data to visa which in turn contacts the issuer to check the account holder’s account or credit line for authorization after the transaction is authorized the issuer effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange reimbursement fee and then posts the transaction to the consumer’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase minus the merchant discount rate mdr to the merchant 

visa earns revenue by facilitating money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers merchants financial institutions businesses strategic partners and government entities through innovative technologies net revenues consist of service revenues data processing revenues international transaction revenues and other revenues minus client incentive arrangements we have with our clients we have one reportable segment which is payment services we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business 

visa is not a financial institution we do not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of visa products nor do we earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to any of these activities interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits that account holders and merchants derive from participating in our payments networks generally interchange reimbursement fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers we establish default interchange reimbursement fees that apply absent other established settlement terms in addition we do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged by acquirers for acceptance including

competition 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change existing and emerging competitors compete with visa’s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce mobile payments blockchain technology and digital currencies these advances are enabling new entrants many of which depart from traditional network payment models in certain countries the evolving regulatory landscape is creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition 

we compete against all forms of payment this includes paperbased payments primarily cash and checks and all forms of electronic payments our electronic payment competitors principally include 

global or multiregional networks these networks typically offer a range of branded general purpose card payment products that consumers can use at millions of merchant locations around the world examples include mastercard american express discover jcb and unionpay these competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the us or have a leading position in certain countries such as unionpay in china see item 1a—risk factors—regulatory risks—governmentimposed obligations andor restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia  based on available data visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world 

table of contents 

the following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2020 1  



1 mastercard american express jcb and diners club  discover data sourced from the nilson report issue 1199 june 2021 mastercard excludes maestro and cirrus figures american express diners club  discover and jcb include business from thirdparty issuers jcb figures include other paymentrelated products and some figures are estimates 

local and regional networks operated in many countries these networks often have the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial institutions or payment processors these networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the us interac in canada eftpos in australia and mir in russia 

alternative payment providers these providers such as digital wallets closed commerce ecosystems bnpl solutions cryptocurrency platforms and accounttoaccount systems often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels however they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale these companies may process payments using inhouse account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the ach global or local networks like visa or some combination of the foregoing in some cases these entities are both a partner and a competitor to visa 

ach and rtp networks these networks are often governed by local regulations primarily focused on interbank transfers many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments we also compete with closedloop payment systems emerging payments networks wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers 

payment processors we compete with payment processors for the processing of visa transactions these processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other networks processors and other third parties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

value added products and service providers we face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value added products and services including information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions merchants and governments and technology companies that provide cyber and fraud solutions regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space 

we believe our fundamental value proposition of security convenience speed and reliability as well as the number of credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed in addition we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions merchants fintechs governments ngos and business organizations to provide tailored and innovative solutions our network of networks strategy implies that we have and we will continue to utilize other networks to facilitate the movement of money we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of payment products and value added services and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably 

government regulation 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used the most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below for further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business see item 1arisk factorsregulatory risks  

anticorruption antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also 

table of contents 

subject to antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac in the us therefore we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive ofac trade sanctions currently cuba iran north korea syria and crimea or that are included on ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons to issue or acquire visa cards or engage in transactions using our services 

governmentimposed market participation restrictions certain governments including china india indonesia russia thailand and vietnam have taken actions to promote domestic payments systems andor certain issuers payments networks or processors by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers impose local ownership requirements on processors require data localization or mandate that domestic processing be done in that country 

interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer act doddfrank act limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions in the us the european union eu ifr limits interchange rates in europe as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia and the central bank of brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange 

internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payment system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling digital currencies the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol and other controversial transaction types 

network exclusivity and routing in the us the doddfrank act limits network exclusivity and restrictions on merchant routing choice for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr’s prohibition in europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card 

nosurcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation 

privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and datahandling practices create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data 

supervisory oversight of the payments industry visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the us for example the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to us financial institutions the federal banking agencies comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration visa also may be separately examined by the bureau of consumer financial protection as a service provider to the banks that issue visabranded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countriesregions including europe india russia ukraine and the united kingdom as discussed below have recognized or designated visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil and hong kong 

european and united kingdom regulations and supervisory oversight visa in europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the united kingdom and the european economic area eea specifically in the united kingdom visa europe is designated as a recognized payment system bringing it within the scope of the bank of england’s supervisory powers and subject to various requirements including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the united kingdom’s financial system visa europe is also regulated by the united kingdom’s payment systems regulator psr which has wideranging powers and authority to review our business practices systems rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the united kingdom and ensuring payments meet account holder needs 

table of contents 

furthermore there are a number of eu regulations that impact our business as discussed above the ifr regulates interchange rates within europe requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decisionmaking purposes within the eu and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing national competent authorities in the eu are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in their markets we are also subject to regulations governing privacy and data protection antibribery antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions other regulations in europe such as the second payment services directive psd2 require among other things that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging nonfinancial institution players psd2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences 

postbrexit the united kingdom has adopted various european regulations including regulations that impact the payments ecosystem such as the ifr and psd2 the psr is responsible for monitoring visa europe’s compliance with the ifr as adopted in the united kingdom 

esg and sustainability certain governments around the world are adopting laws and regulations pertaining to esg performance transparency and reporting regulations may include mandated corporate reporting on esg overall eg eu sustainable reporting directive or in individual areas such as mandated reporting on climaterelated financial disclosures 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies across the world also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues including mobile payment transactions tokenization access rights for nonfinancial institutions money transfer services identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and our business furthermore following the passage of psd2 in europe several countries including australia brazil canada hong kong and mexico are contemplating granting or have already granted various types of access rights to third party processors including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients these changes could have negative implications for our business depending on how the regulations are framed and implemented

 item 1a risk factors 

regulatory risks 

we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations see item 1 — business — government regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulations on us our clients and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules affect our existing contractual arrangements increase our compliance costs require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties including competitors in an undesirable manner and reduce our revenue opportunities as discussed in more detail below we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion pointofsale transaction rules and practices privacy data use or protection licensing requirements and associated product technology as a result the visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities our diversification into new product offerings and participation in new flows could also introduce new licensing and other regulatory obligations that impact our business 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws such as antimoney laundering anticorruption competition money transfer services privacy and sanctions and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve however we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal penalties litigation investigations and proceedings and damage to our global brands and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa products our clients issue the volume of payments we process our revenues our brands our competitive positioning our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services the quality and types of products and services we offer the countries in which our products are used and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products all of which could harm our business 

increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees merchant discount rates operating rules risk management protocols and other related practices could harm our business 

regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see item 1 — business —government regulation for more information  in the us and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction in the context of credit and debit transactions those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers the reverse is true for certain transactions like atm interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 

interchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example regulations adopted by the us federal reserve cap the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent the doddfrank act also limits issuers’ and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacts our business earlier this year the federal reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would among other things require issuers to ensure that at least two networks are available for routing card not present debit transactions various stakeholder groups are also advocating that the federal reserve further lower interchange fees on debit transactions and restrict the ability of payments networks to enter 

table of contents 

into certain incentive and growth agreements with issuers in addition there continues to be interest in further regulation of interchange fees and routing practices by members of congress and state legislators in the us the eu’s ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and crossborder transactions within the eea 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively eu member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories the european commission concluded its impact assessment of the ifr indicating that while it does not intend to expand the legislation at this time it will continue to monitor market dynamics countries in other parts of the world including the latin america region have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps for example in march 2017 argentina’s central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions in march 2018 brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions and in march 2020 the congress in costa rica passed legislation allowing the central bank to regulate interchange and other fees this trend to regulate pricing continued in latin america in 2021 when the president in chile signed legislation to create a committee to set interchange caps finally in australia the reserve bank completed its review of the country’s payment system regulations and made a series of preliminary recommendations including to further lower interchange rates for debit transactions and set expectations for issuers and acquirers in the country to support greater issuance and acceptance of dualbadged debit cards and allow merchant choice routing on certain transactions 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors’ closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees or reducing certain benefits to consumers which make our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher mdr regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternative payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us including reductions in the fees that we charge which may directly impact our revenues 

in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business for example many governments including but not limited to governments in india and turkey are using regulation to further drive down mdr which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions some countries in latin america like peru and chile are relying on antitrustdriven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate the psr’s review of the acquiring market in the united kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business with increased merchant lobbying we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services or to have the other network’s functionality or brand marks on our products as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence for instance new products and capabilities including tokenization push payments and noncard based payment flows eg visa b2b connect could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered in addition the eu’s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies 

we are also subject to central bank oversight in a growing number of countries including brazil india russia the united kingdom and within the eu furthermore some countries with existing oversight frameworks are looking to further enhance their regulatory powers this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally as well as localized risk management or governance increased oversight could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system additionally regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles 

regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings for example our settlement with the european commission on crossborder interchange rates has drawn some preliminary attention of regulators in other parts of the world similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to similar regulation 

table of contents 

as debit payments or vice versa for instance the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 

governmentimposed obligations andor restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia 

governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks brands and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations to varying degrees these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments or data processing be performed entirely within that country which could prevent us from managing the endtoend processing of certain transactions 

in russia legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions the central bank controlled national payment card system nspk is the only entity allowed to process domestically in china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the people’s bank of china pboc to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural steps for approval remain uncertain the approval process might require several years and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks 

regulatory initiatives in india also suggest growing nationalistic priorities including a data localization mandate passed by the government which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers furthermore any inability to meet the requirements of the data localization mandate could impact our ability to do business in india in europe with the support of the european central bank a group of european banks have announced their intent to launch a paneuropean payment system the european payments initiative or epi with the purported intent to reduce the risks of disintermediation by international technology companies and continued reliance on international payments networks for intraeurope card transactions furthermore regional groups of countries such as the gulf cooperation council gcc and a number of countries in southeast asia are considering or may consider efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions the african development bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability finally some countries such as south africa are mandating onshore processing of domestic transactions geopolitical events including sanctions trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify any or all of these activities which could adversely affect our business 

due to our inability to manage the endtoend processing of transactions for cards in certain countries eg russia and thailand we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or thirdparty processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or onshore processing 

cobadging and coresidency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing for example in china certain banks have issued dualbranded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks the pboc is contemplating that dualbranded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china’s domestic payments market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visaonly branded cards for international travel and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license however notwithstanding such efforts the phase out of dualbranded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in china furthermore as discussed above australia is contemplating additional requirements to mandate dualbadged or cobadged cards that support the local domestic debit network eftpos 

mir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china respectively and are actively pursuing international expansion plans which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule which requires that international transactions on visa cards be routed over visanet furthermore although regulatory barriers shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china respectively alternative payment providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce offline and crossborder payments which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china netsunion clearing corp a

chinese digital transaction routing system and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with international payments networks  

finally central banks in a number of countries including those in argentina australia brazil canada and russia are in the process of developing or expanding national realtime payments networks with the goal of driving a greater number of domestic transactions onto these systems similarly an increasing number of jurisdictions are exploring the concept of building central bank digital currencies for retail payments if successfully deployed these national payment platforms and digital currencies could have significant implications for visa’s domestic and crossborder payments including potential disintermediation 

in general national laws that protect or otherwise support domestic providers or processing may increase our costs decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products services and innovations force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets and create new competitors all of which could harm our business 

laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us  

our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world for example in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union cjeu ruled to invalidate the useu privacy shield — a legal framework that allowed participating companies to transfer personal data from eu member states to the us visa has never used the privacy shield framework for its transfers and relies instead on standard contractual clauses however the cjeu ruling made clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny as well significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for example the eu’s and uk’s general data protection regulation gdpr extends the scope of the eu and uk data protection law to all companies processing data of eu and uk residents regardless of the company’s location the law requires companies to comply with a broad range of requirements regarding the handling of personal information although we have a global data privacy program that addresses the requirements applicable to our international business our ongoing efforts to comply with gdpr and rapidly emerging privacy and data protection laws in countries such as india or states in the us such as colorado and virginia may increase the complexity of our compliance operations entail substantial expenses divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer 

furthermore inconsistent local and regional regulations restricting location movement collection use and management of data may limit our ability to innovate or compete in certain jurisdictions for example china adopted its first comprehensive privacy law the personal information protection law pipl which took effect in november 2021 although certain details of pipl may require further regulatory clarification or guidance visa could be impacted more significantly if our license is approved and we begin conducting domestic bank card clearing activity in china lastly enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in tax laws 

we exercise significant judgment and make estimates in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service the uk’s hm revenue and customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions including unilateral actions of foreign jurisdictions to introduce digital services taxes or changes resulting from the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s programme of work related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and design of a system to ensure multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax to

the countries where we earn revenue may also materially affect our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

litigation risks 

we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place 

we are involved in numerous litigation matters investigations and proceedings asserted by civil litigants governments and enforcement bodies investigating or alleging among other things violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law privacy law and intellectual property law these are referred to as “actions” in this section details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report these actions are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable in any material action particularly in a large class action lawsuit such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the us or we incur liability arising from a government investigation we may be required to pay significant awards settlements or fines in addition settlement terms judgments orders or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by influencing or requiring us to modify among other things the default interchange reimbursement rates we set the visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules our fees or pricing or the way we do business these actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators investigators governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions which may lead to additional actions against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them even if visa is not a defendant 

for certain actions like those that are us covered litigation or ve territory covered litigation as described in note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

business risks 

we face intense competition in our industry 

the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors or methods of payment emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multiregional networks other domestic and closedloop payments systems and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients other emerging payment providers such as fintechs other digital payments technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce social media and mobile channels as well as governments in a number of jurisdictions eg brazil india and russia that are developing supporting andor operating national schemes real time payments networks and other payment platforms 

our competitors may acquire or develop substantially better technology have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer more effective innovative or a wider range of programs products and services they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater use including with respect to issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions which could hurt our financial results and prospects 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to 

table of contents 

regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternative payments systems like alipay and wechat pay operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the doddfrank act the ifr in europe or real time payment initiatives by governments such as the us federal reserve’s fednow or the central bank of brazil’s pix system may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models and may create new competitors including in some cases the government itself similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies and platforms including mobile payments alternative payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example 

• we along with our competitors clients network participants and others are developing or participating in alternative payments systems or products such as mobile payment services ecommerce payment services p2p payment services realtime and faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ach or direct debits from or to consumer checking accounts that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value added services we provide to support such processing examples include initiatives from the clearing house an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system early warning services which operates zelle a bankoffered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or realtime payments across a variety of payment types including p2p corporate and government disbursement bill pay and deposit check transactions and cryptocurrency or stablecoinbased payments initiatives 

• similarly many countries are developing or promoting domestic networks switches and realtime payment systems eg india russia as well as europe to the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions prohibit international payments networks like visa from participating on those systems andor impose restrictions or prohibitions on international payments networks from offering payment services on such transactions we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries for example in argentina the government has mandated local acquirers to use debit card credentials to initiate payment transactions on a governmentsponsored national realtime payment system furthermore in some regions eg southeast asia the middle east through intergovernmental organizations such as the association of southeast asian nations and the gcc some countries are looking into crossborder connectivity of such domestic systems 

• parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain 

• parties that access our payment credentials tokens and technologies including clients technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate or steer account holders and other clients to alternative payment methods or use our payment credentials tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms 

• participants in the payments industry may merge form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new competing payment services and 

• new or revised industry standards related to online checkout and web payments cloudbased payments tokenization or other paymentsrelated technologies set by individual countries regions or organizations such as the international organization for standardization american national standards institute world wide web consortium european card standards group pci co nexo and emvco may result in additional costs and expenses for visa and its clients or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services 

table of contents 

as the competitive landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses products services and practices we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth 

our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and develop 

our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue nonvisa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition for more information please see note 14—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

in addition we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients in order to stay competitive we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments adapt to regulatory changes and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include upfront cash payments fee discounts rebates credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in relation to other network options or forms of payment market pressures on pricing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits 

in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or cobrand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 

merchants’ and processors’ continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the use and acceptance of visa products certain merchants and merchantaffiliated groups have been exerting their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions such as the us canada and europe to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory intervention filing lawsuits and in some cases refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses issuers may decrease their issuance of our products and consumer usage of our products could be adversely impacted for example in the us certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and the cost of payment card acceptance in addition to ongoing litigation related to the us migration to emvcapable cards and pointofsale terminals us merchantaffiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process and some policymakers have expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council in the development of payment card standards additionally some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transactions to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers’ usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement andor litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business 

table of contents 

we depend on relationships with financial institutions acquirers processors merchants payment facilitators ecommerce platforms fintechs and other third parties 

as noted above our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for instance we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace we engage in discussions with merchants acquirers ecommerce platforms and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we also engage in many payment card cobranding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem whether as for example an issuer merchant ecommerce platform or digital wallet provider as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships in addition we depend on our clients and third parties including network partners vendors and suppliers to submit facilitate and process transactions properly provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and otherwise adhere to our operating rules and applicable laws to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their visabranded payment products which could harm our business and reputation 

our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation or if we experience brand disintermediation 

our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business we believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the pointofsale and decrease the value of our brand our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including authorization clearing and settlement service disruptions data security breaches compliance failures by visa including our employees agents clients partners or suppliers failure to meet our environmental social and governance goals negative perception of our industry the industries of our clients visaaccepting merchants or our clients’ customers including third party payments providers illperceived actions or affiliations by clients partners or other third parties such as sponsorship or cobrand partners and fraudulent controversial or illegal activities using our payment products if we are unable to maintain our reputation the value of our brand may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients account holders governments and the public as well as impact our business 

global economic political market health and social events or conditions including the ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic may harm our business 

more than half of our net revenues are earned outside the us international crossborder transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic political market health and social events or conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or a slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer small business government and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics like covid19 or other local or global health issues political uncertainties international hostilities armed conflict or unrest climaterelated events including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters could have similar impacts on our operations clients thirdparty suppliers activities in a particular location or globally and crossborder travel and spend geopolitical trends towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions tariffs or trade restrictions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions in addition as governments investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental governance and social topics governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may impose new expectations or focus investments in ways that cause significant shifts in disclosure commerce and consumption behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business as a result of any of these factors any decline in cross

border travel and spend could impact the number of crossborder transactions we process and our currency exchange activities which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues 

a decline in economic political market health and social conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions could reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which ultimately impact our revenues they may also implement costreduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if clients default on their settlement obligations it may also impact our liquidity any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue 

the ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties including the transmissibility severity duration and resurgence of the outbreak new variants of the virus the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities including vaccines and treatments the speed and strength of an economic recovery including the reopening of borders and the resumption of international travel and the impact to our employees and our operations the business of our clients suppliers and business partners and other factors such as 

• third party disruptions including potential outages at network providers call centers and other suppliers 

• increased consumer dispute volumes due to travel or event cancellations and the speed or accuracy in processing refunds 

• increased cyber and payment fraud risk as cybercriminals attempt ddos related attacks phishing scams and other disruptive actions given the shift to online banking ecommerce and other online activity as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the ongoing pandemic 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our data centers affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our issuers acquirers or merchants 

• additional regulatory requirements including for example government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payments fees or other costs a number of countries have taken steps to temporarily cap interchange or other fees on electronic payments as part of their covid19 economic relief measures it is possible that some or all of these caps may become permanent over time or that we see governments introduce additional andor new pricing caps in future economic relief initiatives in addition proponents of interchange andor mdr regulation may try to position government intervention as necessary to support recovery efforts in an overall soft global economy such pricing measures could result in additional financial pressures on our business and 

• workforce impacts such as difficulty recruiting retaining training motivating and developing employees due to evolving health and safety protocols changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models restrictions on immigration travel and employee mobility and the challenges of maintaining our strong corporate culture which values communication collaboration and connections despite a majority of employees working from home 

our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity 

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa operating rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa card payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions concurrent settlement failures or insolvencies involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure or insolvency we may

technology and cybersecurity risks 

failure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth 

the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity and inapp payment technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrencies distributed ledger and blockchain technologies and new authentication technologies such as biometrics 3d secure 20 and dynamic cardholder verification values or dcvv2 as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve including those developed by visa such as our crossborder b2b payment service visa b2b connect in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated moreover some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or claims potentially impacting our development efforts andor requiring us to obtain licenses if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients impact our intellectual property or licensing rights harm our business and impact our future growth 

a disruption failure or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our business 

our cybersecurity and processing systems as well as those of financial institutions merchants and thirdparty service providers have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience errors interruptions delays or damage from a number of causes including power outages hardware software and network failures computer viruses malware or other destructive software internal design manual or user errors cyberattacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters severe weather conditions and other effects from climate change in addition there is risk that third party suppliers of hardware and infrastructure required to operate our data centers and support employee productivity could be impacted by supply chain disruptions such as manufacturing and shipping delays an extended supply chain disruption could also impact processing or delivery of technology services 

furthermore our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts we have been and may continue to be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions merchants or thirdparty processors we are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders such attacks and breaches have resulted and may continue to result in fraudulent activity and ultimately financial losses to visa’s clients and it is difficult to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business 

numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes particularly on our internetfacing applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our thirdparty service providers because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the security measures and procedures we our financial institution and merchant clients other merchants and thirdparty service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches cyberattacks or system failures in some cases the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards who may not be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or fix security defects or whose hardware software or network services may be subject to error defect delay outage or lack appropriate malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exfiltration incidents although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity acquired entities and supplier risk management

structural and organizational risks 

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments and may face risks and uncertainties as a result 

as part of our overall business strategy we make acquisitions and strategic investments we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties including

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock and in certain specified circumstances holders of our series a b and c preferred stock can vote on certain significant transactions with respect to our class b and c common stock these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series a b and c preferred stock voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series a b and c preferred stock would receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or in the case of series b and c preferred stock holders would receive securities cash or other property that is different from what our class a common stockholders would receive because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class a common stock are our current and former financial institution clients they may have interests that diverge from our class a common stockholders as a result the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class a common stockholders

coronavirus as the effects of an evolving coronavirus “covid19” pandemic continues much remains uncertain our priority remains the safety of our employees clients and the communities in which we live and operate we are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices with most of our employees currently working remotely we continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees clients partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times 

the ongoing effects of covid19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties including the transmissibility severity duration and resurgence of the outbreak new variants of the virus the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities including vaccines and treatments the speed and strength of an economic recovery including the reopening of borders and the resumption of international travel and the impact to our employees and our operations the business of our clients suppliers and business partners and other factors identified in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business 

highlights for fiscal 2021  net revenues were 241 billion an increase of 10 over the prior year primarily due to the yearoveryear growth in payments volume processed transactions and crossborder volume helped by 

table of contents 

fewer covid19 restrictions partially offset by higher client incentives exchange rate movements and our hedging program positively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point 

gaap operating expenses were 83 billion and increased 7 over the prior year primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing expenses partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses nongaap operating expenses were 81 billion and increased 5 over the prior year primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing expenses partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses exchange rate movements negatively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately half a percentage point 

nongaap financial results we use nongaap financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations as they may be nonrecurring or have no cash impact and may distort our longerterm operating trends we consider nongaap measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance 

• gains and losses on equity investments gains and losses on equity investments include periodic noncash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment these longterm investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019 amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are noncash and are significantly affected by the timing frequency and size of our acquisitions rather than our core operations as such we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance 

• acquisitionrelated costs acquisitionrelated costs consist primarily of onetime transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations these costs include professional fees technology integration fees restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities it also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense postcombination we have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business 

• remeasurement of deferred tax balances during fiscal 2021 in connection with the uk enacted legislation on june 10 2021 that increases the tax rate from 19 to 25 effective april 1 2023 we remeasured our uk deferred tax liabilities resulting in the recognition of a nonrecurring noncash income tax expense of 10 billion 

during fiscal 2020 in connection with the uk enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19 to 17 that was effective on april 1 2020 we remeasured our uk deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date resulting in the recognition of a nonrecurring noncash income tax expense of 329 million see note 19—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

• indirect taxes during fiscal 2021 we recognized a onetime charge within general and administrative expense of 152 million before tax net of the related income tax benefit of 40 million determined by applying applicable tax rates nongaap net income increased by 112 million this charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes related to prior periods for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law this onetime charge is not representative of our ongoing operations 

• resolution of a tax item during fiscal 2020 we resolved a longoutstanding tax matter dating back more than 12 years relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering the resolution of this matter resulted in the recognition of a onetime charge to income tax expense of 28 million which we believe is not representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate 

table of contents 

• litigation provision during fiscal 2019 we recorded a litigation provision of 370 million and related tax benefits of 83 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation the tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision under the us retrospective responsibility plan we recover the monetary liabilities related to the us covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report

the effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 mainly due to the following

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

• provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios 

• ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities 

• ensure payments on required litigation settlements 

• make planned capital investments in our business 

• pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and 

• invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs and earn additional income 

based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

table of contents 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 



operating activiti es cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in our underlying business lower client incentive payments and timing and impact of covid19 on settlement in the prior fiscal year 

investing activities cash was used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher purchases net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities 

financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to the absence of proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in the prior year the 30 billion principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes and higher share repurchases see note 10—debt and note 15—stockholders’ equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide 

cash cash equivalents and investments as of september 30 2021 our cash and cash equivalents balance were 165 billion and our availableforsale debt securities were 32 billion our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies 15 billion of the investments are classified as current and are available to meet shortterm liquidity needs the remaining noncurrent investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however they are also generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance at september 30 2021 we had no outstanding obligations under the program see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

table of contents 

credit facility we have an unsecured 50 billion revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires on july 25 2024 as of september 30 2021 there were no borrowings under the credit facility see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

us litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the us retrospective responsibility plan which was created to insulate visa and our class a common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases we maintain a us litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation will be payable as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the us covered litigation matters we do not rely on them for other operational needs see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this repor t 

credit ratings 

various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payments industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy our credit ratings are published by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the us and have not changed from the prioryear comparable period we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlements in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions in general during fiscal 2021 we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital at september 30 2021 we held 91 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs see note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report  

litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings other than the us covered litigation and ve territory covered litigation which are covered by the us and europe retrospective responsibility plans could give rise to future liquidity needs see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this repor t

in january 2020 the fasb issued asu 202001 which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative the amendments in the asu are effective on october 1 2021 the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2020 the fasb issued asu 202004 which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying us gaap to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the london interbank offered rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform subsequently the fasb also issued an amendment to this standard the amendments in the asu are effective upon issuance through december 31 2022 we are evaluating the effect asu 202004 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into longterm incentive agreements with financial institution clients merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume increasing visa product acceptance winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance these estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using clientreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients merchants and business partners 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual performance is not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2021 client incentives represented 26 of gross revenues 

table of contents 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss if any in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on management’s understanding of the litigation profile the specifics of each case our history with similar proceedings advice of inhouse and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

we have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation however our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plan’s mechanisms include the use of the us litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the us litigation escrow account balance our europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liabilities and losses relating to the covered period subject to certain limitations and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the european commission proceedings or any other matter see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions based on our interpretation of local tax laws we also inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated nonfunctional currency denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

table of contents 

at september 30 2021 and 2020 the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 27 billion and 39 billion respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2021 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast at september 30 2021 the effect of a hypothetical 10 weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of approximately 190 million on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts the loss from this hypothetical weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currencydenominated revenues and payments see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 13—derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of visa europe is the euro translation from the euro to the us dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10 change in the euro against the us dollar compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2021 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 20 billion see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income 

at september 30 2021 and 2020 the fair value of our fixedrate investment securities were 55 billion and 40 billion respectively and the fair value of our adjustablerate investment securities were 02 billion and 20 billion respectively at september 30 2021 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 40 million any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity 

we have interest rate and crosscurrency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our us dollar denominated fixedrate payments into us dollar and euro denominated floatingrate payments by entering into interest rate swaps we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately 40 million in annual interest expense see note 13—derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

equity investment risk 

as of september 30 2021 and 2020 the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities was 15 billion and 10 billion respectively these investments are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our holdings a decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies we regularly review our nonmarketable equity securities for possible impairment which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs and the viability of its business model 

table of contents 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2021 and 2020 our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 13 billion and 11 billion respectively and projected benefit obligations were 09 billion at each year end a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding as of september 30 2021 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 225 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 26 million in pension cost 

at september 30 2021 and 2020 our nonus defined benefit pension plan assets were 05 billion at each year end and projected benefit obligations were 05 billion and 06 billion respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding as of september 30 2021 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 166 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 16 million in pension cost 

we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2022 if any which would be made in september 2022

accelerating our business fiscal year 2020 key focus areas 

f iscal year 2020 and covid19 have brought unprecedented challenges and widespread economic and social change at the same time the past fiscal year demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our strategy and the meaningful role we play at the center of the payments ecosystem it has also accelerated progress including accelerating the shift to ecommerce and the demand for contactless payments providing significant opportunities for visa that are aligned with our strategy as we look to be a single point of connection for money movement globally there are three primary levers to that growth — consumer payments new flows and value added services we are also building and acquiring new capabilities that can add value to our clients and strengthen the foundation of our business technology security brand and talent 

1 consumer payments 

for decades visa’s growth has been driven by the strength of our core business solutions — credit debit and prepaid products — as well as our global atm network as the pace of change accelerates each year helped by the advancement of technology and our focus on the user experience in payments for both the facetoface and ecommerce environments we see significant opportunity for continued growth we are accelerating efforts to move approximately 18 trillion in consumer spending still done in cash and check to cards and digital credentials on the visa network 

core business 

credit credit cards and digital credentials are issued by visa’s clients and allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay for goods and services credit cards are affiliated with programs operated by financial institution clients cobrand partners fintechs and affinity partners visa does not extend credit to account holders however we provide technology authorization services fraud tools and brand support that issuers use to enable their credit programs we also work with our clients on product design consumer segmentation and consumer experience design to help them deliver products and services that match their customers’ needs 

debit debit cards and digital credentials are issued by financial institutions and allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods and services using funds held in their bank accounts debit cards enable account holders to transact in person online or via mobile without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit visa provides a strong brand network infrastructure which includes processing acceptance product features and support risk tools and services and industry expertise to help issuers optimize their debit offerings

global atm the visaplus global atm network provides account holders with cash access and other banking capabilities in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both financial institutions and independent atm operators 

engagement 

ecommerce 

ecommerce has evolved since the first online purchase was made on the visa network more than 25 years ago in fiscal year 2020 due in part to the covid19 pandemic there was a significant acceleration in the shift away from cash to digital forms of payment ecommerce represents only about 14 of global retail spending so there is still substantial opportunity for ecommerce growth we are helping to transform the digital checkout experience by adding more security and removing friction with the launch of visa click to pay enabled by the emv® secure remote commerce specifications click to pay simplifies the checkout experience eliminating the need for a consumer to enter payment details each time they are paying online this means greater consistency and fewer steps at checkout regardless of one’s payment choice consumers can click to pay with visa with confidence when they see the click to pay icon a stylized depiction of a fast forward icon where visa is accepted 1 

during fiscal year 2020 click to pay went live with select merchants and payment processors and platforms in the us and was enabled in new geographies including australia canada china colombia hong kong malaysia mexico new zealand poland qatar singapore south africa ukraine united arab emirates and the united kingdom  

tap to pay 

as we seek to improve the user experience in the facetoface environment tap to pay which is tapping a contactless card or mobile device on a terminal to make a payment has emerged as the preferred way to check out amongst consumers in many markets around the world contactless penetration grew to 43 of all facetoface transactions around the world in fiscal year 2020 in addition visa has worked with payments industry partners and governments to support raising contactless payments limits in markets around the world that require cardholder verification on tap to pay transactions more than 50 markets across europe the middle east africa and canada have taken this step to help more individuals utilize this way to pay in fiscal year 2020 

the us is one of the most significant opportunities for growth in tap to pay tap to pay awareness and adoption accelerated in the us this year and we expect that demand to continue to grow more than 70 of facetoface transactions at checkout in the us occur at a merchant that has the ability to accept contactless payments and more than 80 of the top 100 merchants by transactions are enabled for tap to pay

acceptance 

a key component of how we expand our business focuses on growing access and increasing acceptance of our products around the world mobile connectivity new acceptance devices untethered to landline infrastructure and new partnerships are enabling visa payments in categories where card acceptance has typically been low such as rent parking and vending machines we accomplish this in a few ways 

drive new acceptance categories to uncover additional growth  we continue to expand our acceptance footprint in both mature and emerging markets so that businesses and devices are enabled to send and receive funds via the visa network in categories such as vending laundry gaming parking electric vehicle charging rent and tuition for example in emerging markets while 40 of the national gdp is contributed by small and microsellers fewer than 10 of these sellers currently accept digital payments in january 2020 visa announced tap to phone technology to help sellers accept digital payments without any additional hardware this technology allows microbusinesses to use smartphones to accept digital payments instead of a software terminal 

promote inclusive financial access  according to the world bank 17 billion adults worldwide still lack access to formal financial services which means they do not have access to the services that can help facilitate the growth of their economic livelihood in 2015 visa made a commitment to provide firsttime access to a digital payments account for 500 million people worldwide by 2020 in support of the world bank’s goal of universal financial access we met this commitment ahead of schedule in 2019 we are continuing this work by supporting women’s advancement small businesses and the expansion of financial inclusion through programs that support skill development and access to networks and financial services for under and unbanked populations for example in june we announced a global commitment to elevate 50 million small and micro businesses worldwide in an effort to help local businesses in the wake of the covid19 pandemic as part of the global commitment visa also formed the visa economic empowerment institute focused on economic and societal issues including pandemic challenges small and micro businesses face and closing racial and gender opportunity gaps

security and identity 

trust is at the core of visa through an evolving and multilayered approach visa strives to expect the unexpected constantly monitoring our network and sharing intelligence with our partners our multiprong security strategy is based on empowering consumers and clients through tools resources and controls to make more informed risk decisions to provide these tools we invest in intelligence and technologies that improve fraud and authorization performance in fiscal year 2020 visa advanced authorization risk scored 141 billion visaprocessed transactions – each transaction across more than 500 risk factors in about one millisecond in the last year visa’s artificial intelligence aipowered risk scoring engine helped financial institutions prevent nearly 25 billion in fraud 

we believe security is an integral driver for growth and innovation several developments over the course of fiscal year 2020 help demonstrate our approach

the foundation of our business is comprised of our technology security brand and talent 

technology 

visa’s technology platform comprises software hardware data centers and a vast telecommunications infrastructure each with a distinct architecture and operational footprint wrapped with several layers of security and protection technologies together these systems deliver the secure convenient and reliable service that our clients and consumers expect of the visa brand 

software 

as part of our global technology environment we build and securely operate hundreds of commercial applications using a diverse set of technologies   our software powers the core functions of our transaction processing — including authorization clearing and settlement and risk scoring — as well as our value added services these applications together work to provide essential services to the payments ecosystem 

hardware 

we rely on a diverse array of sophisticated infrastructure systems that are tailored to our services visas infrastructure is designed and configured with layers of redundancies we have multiple instances of our software running on separate pieces of hardware which is designed to provide continuous availability our disaster recovery capabilities are tiered so that our realtime transaction processing services can be continuously available 

data centers 

visa operates four data centers that are a critical part of our global processing environment and are built with the capacity to support visa’s growing power cooling and space needs all of our data centers have high redundancy of network connectivity power and cooling designed to provide continuous availability of systems we are continuing to reduce the carbon footprint of our data centers by deploying efficiency improvement strategies including led lighting variable airflow automation controls and hotandcold air containment technologies 

telecommunications 

we connect our clients and partners to visa’s data centers through a massive telecommunications network covering more than 10 million route miles each network node is connected through redundant links designed to provide high levels of security availability and performance for our products and services 

security 

in parallel with our role in advancing the security of the broader payments ecosystem visa remains committed to championing cybersecurity our multifaceted security approach includes deploying security tools that help keep our clients and consumers safe while providing solutions that make visa the best way to pay and be paid 

we invest significantly in our comprehensive approach to cybersecurity at visa we deploy security technologies to protect against data confidentiality integrity and availability risks emphasizing core cybersecurity 

table of content s 

capabilities to minimize risk exposure our indepth security approach applies multiple layers of protection to reduce the risk of any single control failing these measures include 

• a formal program to devalue sensitive andor personal data through various cryptographic means

talent 

central to our longterm strategy is attracting developing and retaining the best talent globally with the right skills to drive our success in fiscal year 2020 the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management a large majority of our workforce worked remotely throughout the second half of 2020 and we instituted safety protocols and procedures for the essential employees who continued to work on site visa committed that no employee layoffs would occur in calendar year 2020 related directly to covid19 visa’s workforce grew in 2020 at a slower pace than prior years increasing from approximately 19500 employees in fiscal year 2019 to approximately 20500 employees in fiscal year 2020 voluntary workforce turnover rolling 12month attrition was 63 in september 2020 at the end of fiscal year 2020 visa’s global workforce was 59 male and 41 female and women represented 34 of visa’s leadership defined as vice president level and above in the us ethnicity of our workforce was 38 white 42 asian 11 hispanic 6 black and 3 other for our us leadership the breakdown was 63 white 19 asian 12 hispanic 4 black and 2 other

mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments 

visa continually explores opportunities to augment our capabilities and provide meaningful value to our clients mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments complement our internal development and enhance our partnerships to align with visa’s priorities visa applies a rigorous integration approach to our acquisitions and investments to ensure they will differentiate our network provide value added services and accelerate growth 

plaid acquisition in january 2020 visa entered into a definitive agreement to acquire plaid a network that makes it easy for people to securely connect their financial accounts to the apps they use to manage their financial lives plaid’s products enable consumers to conveniently share their financial information with thousands of apps and services visa’s acquisition of plaid represents both an entry into new businesses and complementary enhancements to visa’s existing business this acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory reviews and approvals 

on november 5 2020 the us department of justice filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california seeking a permanent injunction to prevent visa from acquiring plaid alleging that the proposed acquisition would substantially lessen competition in violation of section 7 of the clayton act and would constitute monopolization under section 2 of the sherman act visa intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit 

intellectual property 

we own and manage the visa brand which stands for acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our portfolio of visaowned trademarks is important to our business generally trademark registrations are valid indefinitely as long as they are in use andor maintained we give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network additionally we have filed patent applications in the us and international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations and own a number of patents patent applications and other intellectual property relating to our business we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the us and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

competition 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change existing and emerging competitors compete with visa’s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce mobile payments blockchain technology and digital currencies these advances are enabling new entrants many of which depart from traditional network payment models in certain countries the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition 

we compete against all forms of payment this includes paperbased payments primarily cash and checks and all forms of electronic payments our electronic payment competitors principally include 

global or multiregional networks  these networks typically offer a range of branded general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world examples include mastercard american express discover jcb and unionpay these competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the us or have a leading position in certain countries for example unionpay is the largest player in china since international card networks were not allowed to process domestic transactions in china until the market started to open up with the first license approval for an international network in fiscal year 2020 see item 1a — risk factors — regulatory risks — governmentimposed obligations andor restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia  based on available data visa is

one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world the following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2019 1  



1 mastercard american express jcb and diners club  discover data sourced from the nilson report issue 1178 june 2020 mastercard excludes maestro and cirrus figures american express diners club  discover and jcb include business from thirdparty issuers jcb figures include other paymentrelated products and some figures are estimates 

local and regional networks  operated in many countries these networks often have the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial institutions these networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the us interac in canada eftpos in australia and mir in russia 

alternate payment providers  these providers often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels but are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale these companies may process payments using inhouse account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the ach global or local networks like visa or some combination of the foregoing in some cases these entities are both a partner and a competitor to visa 

ach and real time payment rtp networks  these networks are often governed by local regulations primarily focused on interbank transfers many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments we also compete with closedloop payment systems emerging payments networks wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers 

payment processors  we compete with payment processors for the processing of visa transactions these processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other networks processors and other thirdparties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance security convenience speed and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions merchants fintechs governments nongovernmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

seasonality and other 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal year 2020 or fiscal year 2019 accounted for more than 30 percent of our net revenues in those years 

in fiscal year 2020 we had two clients that accounted for 11 and 10 of our total net revenues respectively we believe this is the result of an unprecedented shift in revenue mix including the decline in crossborder revenue as a result of the pandemic in fiscal year 2019 and 2018 no client generated greater than 10 of our total net revenues  

working capital 

payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions

government regulation 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used the most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below for further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business see item 1arisk factorsregulatory risks  

anticorruption antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also subject to antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac in the us therefore we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive ofac trade sanctions currently cuba iran north korea syria and crimea or that are included on ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons to issue or acquire visa cards or engage in transactions using our services 

governmentimposed market participation restrictions certain governments including china india indonesia russia thailand and vietnam have taken actions to promote domestic payments systems andor certain issuers payments networks or processors by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers impose local ownership requirements on processors require data localization or mandate domestic processing be done in that country 

interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer act doddfrank act limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions in the us the european union eu ifr limits interchange rates in europe as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia and the central bank of brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange 

internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol 

network exclusivity and routing in the us the doddfrank act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr’s prohibition in europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card 

nosurcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation 

privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and datahandling practices create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data 

supervisory oversight of the payments industry visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the us for example the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to us financial institutions the federal banking agencies comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration visa also may be separately examined by the bureau of consumer financial protection as a service provider to the banks that issue visabranded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countriesregions including europe russia ukraine and the united kingdom as discussed below have recognized or designated visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil and hong kong

european and united kingdom regulations and supervisory oversight visa in europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the european economic area eea visa europe is designated as a recognized payment system in the united kingdom bringing it within the scope of the bank of england’s supervisory powers and subject to various requirements including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the united kingdom’s financial system visa europe is also subject to the european central bank’s oversight whose main focus is on the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area including the security operational reliability and business continuity of payment systems furthermore visa europe is regulated by the united kingdom’s payment systems regulator psr which has wideranging powers and authority to review our business practices systems rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the united kingdom and ensuring payments meet account holder needs the psr is also the regulator responsible for monitoring visa europe’s compliance with the ifr in the united kingdom the ifr regulates interchange rates within europe requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decisionmaking purposes within the eu and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing national competent authorities in the eu are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in their markets 

there are other regulations in the european union that impact our business as discussed above including regulations governing privacy and data protection antibribery antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions other regulations in europe such as the second payment services directive psd2 require among other things that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging nonfinancial institution players psd2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences 

as discussed in item 1a — risk factors — business risks — the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results and brexit could lead to further legal and regulatory complexity in europe 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies across the world also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues including mobile payment transactions tokenization access rights for nonfinancial institutions money transfer identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us furthermore following the passage of psd2 in europe several countries including australia brazil canada hong kong and mexico are contemplating granting or have already granted various types of access rights to thirdparty processors including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients which could have negative implications for our business depending on how the regulations are framed and implemented

regulatory risks 

we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations see item 1 — business — government regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulations on us our clients and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules affect our existing contractual arrangements increase our compliance costs require us to make our technology or

intellectual property available to third parties including competitors in an undesirable manner and reduce our revenue opportunities as discussed in more detail below we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion pointofsale transaction rules and practices privacy data use or protection licensing requirements and associated product technology as a result the visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws such as antimoney laundering anticorruption competition privacy and sanctions and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve however we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal penalties litigation investigations and proceedings and damage to our global brands and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa products our clients issue the volume of payments we process our revenues our brands our competitive positioning our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services the quality and types of products and services we offer the countries in which our products are used and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products all of which could harm our business 

increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees merchant discount rates operating rules risk management protocols and other related practices could harm our business 

regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see item 1 — business —government regulation for more information  in the us and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction in the context of credit and debit transactions those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers the reverse is true for certain transactions like atm interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 

interchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example regulations adopted by the us federal reserve cap the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent the doddfrank act also limits issuers’ and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacts our business the eu’s ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and crossborder transactions within the eea 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively eu member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories the european commission concluded its impact assessment of the ifr indicating that while it does not intend to expand the legislation at this time it will continue to monitor market dynamics countries in other parts of the world including the latin america region have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps for example in march 2017 argentina’s central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions in march 2018 brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions and in march 2020 the congress in costa rica passed legislation allowing the central bank to regulate interchange and other fees finally in australia the reserve bank is in the process of reviewing the country’s payment system regulations which could potentially result in lower andor additional interchange caps and other restrictions on our business 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors’ closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees or reducing certain benefits to consumers which make our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates mdr regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to 

table of content s 

accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us including reductions in the fees that we charge which may directly impact our revenues 

in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business for example many governments including but not limited to governments in india and turkey are using regulation to further drive down mdr which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions some countries in latin america like peru and chile are relying on antitrustdriven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate the psr’s review of the acquiring market in the united kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business with increased merchant lobbying we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services or to have the other network’s functionality or brand marks on our products as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence for instance new products and capabilities including tokenization push payments and noncard based payment flows eg b2b connect could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered in addition the european union’s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies 

we are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets including brazil russia the united kingdom and within the european union this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally as well as localized risk management or governance they could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system additionally regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles 

regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings for example our settlement with the european commission on crossborder interchange rates has drawn some preliminary attention of regulators in other parts of the world similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments or vice versa for instance the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 

governmentimposed obligations andor restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia 

governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks brands and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations to varying degrees these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments or data processing be performed entirely within that country which could prevent us from managing the endtoend processing of certain transactions 

in russia legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions the central bank controlled national payment card system nspk is the only entity allowed to process domestically in china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the people’s bank of china pboc to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural steps for approval remain uncertain the approval process might require several years and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks

regulatory initiatives in india also suggest growing nationalistic priorities including a data localization mandate passed by the government which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers in europe with the support of the european central bank a group of european banks have announced their intent to launch a paneuropean payment system the european payments initiative or epi with the purported intent to reduce the risks of disintermediation by international technology companies and continued reliance on international payments networks for intraeurope card transactions furthermore regional groups of countries such as the gulf cooperation council gcc and a number of countries in southeast asia are considering or may consider efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions the african development bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability finally some countries such as south africa are mandating onshore processing of domestic transactions geopolitical events including sanctions trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify any or all of these activities which could adversely affect our business 

due to our inability to manage the endtoend processing of transactions for cards in certain countries eg russia and thailand we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or thirdparty processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or onshore processing 

cobadging and coresidency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing for example in china certain banks have issued dualbranded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks the pboc is contemplating that dualbranded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china’s domestic payments market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visaonly branded cards for international travel and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license however notwithstanding such efforts the phase out of dualbranded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in china 

mir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china respectively and are actively pursuing international expansion plans which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule which requires that international transactions on visa cards be routed over visanet furthermore although regulatory barriers shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china respectively alternate payment providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce offline and crossborder payments which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china recently with strong backing from china’s government a new digital transaction routing system known as netsunion was established the pboc allowed alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in netsunion it and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with international payments networks  

finally central banks including those in australia brazil and russia are in the process of developing or expanding national realtime payments networks with the goal of driving a greater number of domestic transactions onto these systems similarly an increasing number of jurisdictions are exploring the concept of building central bank digital currencies for retail payments if successfully deployed these national payment platforms and digital currencies could have significant implications for visa’s domestic and crossborder payments including potential disintermediation 

in general national laws that protect or otherwise support domestic providers or processing may increase our costs decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products services and innovations force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets and create new competitors all of which could harm our business 

laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us  

our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world for example in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union cjeu ruled to invalidate the useu privacy shield  a legal 

table of content s 

framework that allowed participating companies to transfer personal data from eu member states to the us visa has never used the privacy shield framework for its transfers and relies instead on standard contractual clauses however the cjeu ruling made clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny as well significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for example the eu’s general data protection regulation gdpr extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the company’s location the law requires companies to comply with a broad range of requirements regarding the handling of personal data although we have a global data privacy program that addresses the requirements applicable to our international business our ongoing efforts to comply with gdpr and rapidly emerging privacy and data protection laws such as the california consumer privacy act and the brazilian general data protection law may increase the complexity of our compliance operations entail substantial expenses divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer i nconsistent local and regional regulations restricting location movement collection use and management of data may limit our ability to innovate or compete in certain jurisdictions for example india has adopted a data localization law that requires all payment system operators to store domestic transaction data only in india such data localization requirements have cost implications for us impact our ability to utilize the efficiencies and value of our global network and could affect our strategy furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in tax laws 

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service the uk’s hm revenue  customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions which may be more likely if there is a change in the us administration or changes resulting from the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s programme of work related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and design of a system to ensure multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax may also materially affect our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

litigation risks 

we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place 

we are involved in numerous litigation matters investigations and proceedings asserted by civil litigants governments and enforcement bodies investigating or alleging among other things violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law privacy law and intellectual property law these are referred to as “actions” in this section details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report these actions are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable in any material action particularly in a large class action lawsuit such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the us or we incur liability arising from a government investigation we may be required to pay significant awards settlements or fines in addition settlement terms judgments or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify among other things the default interchange reimbursement rates we set the visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules our fees or pricing or the way we do business these actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators investigators governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions which may lead to additional actions 

table of content s 

against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them even if visa is not a defendant 

for certain actions like those that are us covered litigation or ve territory covered litigation as described in note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

business risks 

the extent to which the covid19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict 

the global impacts of the covid19 outbreak and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment and have significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity the outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace or total lockdown orders and business limitations and shutdowns that began in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel implementing office closures having our employees work remotely for the rest of 2020 and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners the covid19 outbreak has also impacted scheduled events in which visa is a sponsor as event organizers consult with health experts government authorities and other stakeholders to prioritize the health and wellbeing of our global community this has caused us to make modifications to some of our planned activities and has impacted some of our marketing initiatives 

crossborder volume continues to be heavily impacted by the decline in travel international crossborder transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue in addition we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors including 

• merchant acquirer and issuer failures and credit settlement risk particularly with respect to the retail travel and hospitality industries which have been impacted especially hard by the pandemic including airlines cruise ships hotels restaurants and entertainment events the closings andor failures of a large number of these businesses could result in financial stress on our acquiring partners and potentially lead to settlement failures triggering visa’s indemnification obligations it could also lead to bankruptcies that may result in impairments to our assets or our receivables to be writtenoff 

• clients may renegotiate existing agreements or seek early renewal of agreements due to the impact of the outbreak on their business payments volume and incentives 

• the mix of visa’s clients or the amount of business we do with certain clients may change 

• third party disruptions including potential outages at network providers call centers and other suppliers 

• increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to covid19 as cybercriminals attempt ddos related attacks phishing scams and other disruptive actions given the shift to online banking ecommerce and other online activity as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the outbreak 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our data centers affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our issuers acquirers or merchants and 

• additional regulatory requirements including for example government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payments fees or other costs a number of countries have taken steps to temporarily cap 

table of content s 

interchange or other fees on electronic payments as part of their covid19 economic relief measures it is possible that some or all of these caps may become permanent over time or that we see governments introduce additional andor new pricing caps in future economic relief initiatives in addition proponents of interchange andor mdr regulation may try to position government intervention as necessary to support recovery efforts in an overall soft global economy such pricing measures could result in additional financial pressures on our business 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect covid19 may have on our business and as a result the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change while we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses including scaling back hiring plans restricting travel lowering marketing spend and the use of external resources the impact that covid19 will have on our business results of operations and financial condition in the longer term remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties including the transmissibility severity and duration of the outbreak the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines and the impact to our employees and our operations the business of our clients supplier and business partners and other factors 

consumers affected by covid19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided for example consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or longterm basis certain industries may take longer to recover particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction and we may continue to see consumers decrease spending on credit products as economic worries continue all of which may have adverse implications for our business 

as a result we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’ global economic impact including lower domestic and cross border spending trends the availability of credit adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recessionary conditions that persist and exacerbate many of the other known risks described in this “risk factors” section 

we face intense competition in our industry 

the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors or methods of payment emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multiregional networks other domestic and closedloop payments systems and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients other emerging payment providers such as fintechs other digital payments technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels as well as governments in a number of jurisdictions eg brazil india and russia that are developing supporting andor operating national schemes real time payment networks and other payment platforms 

our competitors may develop substantially better technology have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer more effective innovative or a wider range of programs products and services they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater use including with respect to issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions which could hurt our financial results and prospects 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternate payments systems like alipay and wechat pay operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the doddfrank act the ifr in europe or real time payment initiatives by governments such as the us federal reserve’s fednow or the central bank of 

table of content s 

brazil’s pix system may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models and may create new competitors including in some cases the government itself similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments alternate payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example 

• we along with our competitors clients network participants and others are developing or participating in alternate payment networks or products such as mobile payment services ecommerce payment services p2p payment services realtime and faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ach or direct debits from or to consumer checking accounts that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value added services we provide to support such processing examples include initiatives from the clearing house an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system early warning services which operates zelle a bankoffered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or realtime payments across a variety of payment types including p2p corporate and government disbursement bill pay and deposit check transactions and cryptocurrency or stablecoinbased payments initiatives 

• similarly many countries are developing or promoting domestic networks switches and realtime payment systems eg india russia as well as europe to the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic or other transactions prohibit international payments networks like visa from participating on those systems andor impose restrictions or prohibitions on international payments networks from offering payment services on such transactions we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries for example in argentina the government recently issued a regulation that mandates local acquirers to use debit card credentials to initiate payment transactions on a governmentsponsored national realtime payment system furthermore in some regions eg southeast asia the middle east through intergovernmental organizations such as the association of southeast asian nations and the gcc some countries are looking into crossborder connectivity of such domestic systems 

• parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain 

• parties that access our payment credentials tokens and technologies including clients technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms 

• participants in the payments industry may merge form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new competing payment services and 

• new or revised industry standards related to online checkout and web payments cloudbased payments tokenization or other paymentsrelated technologies set by individual countries regions or organizations such as the international organization for standardization american national standards institute world wide web consortium european card standards group pci co nexo and emvco may result in additional costs and expenses for visa and its clients or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services 

as the competitive landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses products services and practices we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth

our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain 

our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue nonvisa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition for more information please see note 14—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

in addition we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients in order to stay competitive we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments adapt to regulatory changes and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include upfront cash payments fee discounts rebates credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options market pressures on pricing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits 

in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or cobrand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 

merchants’ and processors’ continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa products certain merchants and merchantaffiliated groups have been exerting their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions such as the us canada and europe to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory intervention filing lawsuits and in some cases refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses issuers may decrease their issuance of our products and consumer usage of our products could be adversely impacted for example in the us certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and the cost of payment card acceptance in addition to ongoing litigation related to the us migration to emvcapable cards and pointofsale terminals us merchantaffiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process and some policymakers have expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council in the development of payment card standards additionally some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transactions to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers’ usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement andor litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business 

we depend on relationships with financial institutions acquirers processors merchants and other third parties 

as noted above our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for instance we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services and 

table of content s 

thereby compete effectively in the marketplace we engage in discussions with merchants acquirers commerce platforms and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we also engage in many payment card cobranding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem whether as for example an issuer merchant commerce platform or digital wallet provider as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships in addition we depend on our clients and third parties including network partners vendors and suppliers to submit facilitate and process transactions properly provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and otherwise adhere to our operating rules and applicable laws to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their visabranded payment products which could harm our business and reputation 

our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation or if we experience brand disintermediation 

our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business we believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the pointofsale and decrease the value of our brand our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including authorization clearing and settlement service disruptions data security breaches compliance failures by visa including our employees agents clients partners or suppliers failure to meet our environmental social and governance goals negative perception of our industry the industries of our clients or visaaccepting merchants illperceived actions by clients partners or other third parties such as sponsorship or cobrand partners and fraudulent risky controversial or illegal activities using our payment products if we are unable to maintain our reputation the value of our brand may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients account holders and the public as well as impact our business 

global economic political market health and social events or conditions may harm our business 

more than half of our net revenues are earned outside the us international crossborder transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic political market health and social events or conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or a slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer small business government and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics or other local or global health issues political uncertainties international hostilities armed conflict or unrest climaterelated events including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters could have similar impacts on our operations clients thirdparty suppliers activities in a particular location or globally and crossborder travel and spend geopolitical trends towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions tariffs or trade restrictions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions as a result of any of these factors any decline in crossborder travel and spend could impact the number of crossborder transactions we process and our currency exchange activities which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues 

a decline in economic political market health and social conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions could reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which ultimately impact our revenues they may also implement costreduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if clients default on their settlement obligations it may also impact our liquidity any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue 

table of content s 

our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity 

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa operating rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa card payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions concurrent settlement failures or insolvencies involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure or insolvency we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government initiated the exit process under article 50 of the treaty of the european union commencing a period of up to two years for the united kingdom and the other eu member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal which was subsequently postponed until january 31 2020 at which point the united kingdom formally withdrew from the eu since then the united kingdom has continued to participate in the eu from a trade and economic perspective while the parties seek to negotiate a trade deal the deadline for agreeing to a trade deal is december 31 2020 uncertainty over the terms of the united kingdom’s continued participation in the european union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the united kingdom and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results 

brexit will lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and european union we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the european union and as a result our visa operating rules and contractual commitments in the united kingdom and the rest of the european union may be impacted in addition applications will need to be made for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member states following the postbrexit transition period these factors may impact our ability to operate and process data in the european union and united kingdom seamlessly this and other brexitrelated issues may require changes to our legal entity structure andor operations in the united kingdom and the european union any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

failure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth 

the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity and inapp payment technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrencies distributed ledger and blockchain technologies and new authentication technologies such as biometrics 3d secure 20 and dynamic cardholder verification values or dcvv2 as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve including those developed by visa such as our crossborder b2b payment service visa b2b connect in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated moreover some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or claims potentially impacting our development efforts andor requiring us to obtain licenses if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to

a disruption failure or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our business 

our cybersecurity and processing systems as well as those of financial institutions merchants and thirdparty service providers have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience errors interruptions delays or damage from a number of causes including power outages hardware software and network failures computer viruses malware or other destructive software internal design manual or usage errors cyberattacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters severe weather conditions and other effects from climate change 

furthermore our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts we have been and may continue to be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions merchants or thirdparty processors we are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders such attacks and breaches have resulted and may continue to result in fraudulent activity and ultimately financial losses to visa’s clients and it is difficult to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business 

numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes particularly on our internet applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our thirdparty service providers because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the security measures and procedures we our financial institution and merchant clients other merchants and thirdparty service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches cyberattacks or system failures in some cases the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards who may not be able to timely patch vulnerabilities or fix security defects or whose hardware software or network services may be subject to error defect delay outage or lack appropriate malware prevention to prevent breaches or data exfiltration incidents although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats 

these events could significantly disrupt our operations impact our clients and consumers damage our reputation and brand result in litigation or claims violations of applicable privacy and other laws and increased regulatory review or scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties result in damages or changes to our business practices decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products decrease our volume revenues and future growth prospects and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise

coronavirus covid19 continues to have an impact globally while we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of covid19 the extent to which covid19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict our priority remains the safety of our employees clients and the communities in which we live and operate we are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office and will continue to have most of our employees work remotely for the rest of 2020 we continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees clients partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times 

revenues in the latter half of fiscal 2020 were impacted by declines in volumes and transactions as a result of covid19 although we are exiting the year with improved results and most countries had stable to positive yearoveryear domestic spending growth in the fiscal fourth quarter crossborder volume however remained depressed led by travel spending as the majority of borders remain closed while we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses including scaling back hiring plans restricting travel lowering marketing spend and the use of external resources the impact that covid19 will have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties including the transmissibility severity and duration of the outbreak the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines and the impact to our employees and our operations the business of our clients supplier and business partners and other factors identified in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business

highlights for fiscal 2020  net revenues for fiscal 2020 were 218 billion a decrease of 5 over the prior year primarily due to the yearoveryear changes payments volume crossborder volume and processed transactions which were impacted by the spread of covid19 globally starting in the latter part of march 2020 exchange rate movements in fiscal 2020 partially mitigated by our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point 

total operating expenses for fiscal 2020 were 78 billion on a gaap basis and decreased 3 over the prior year driven by lower litigation provision and our overall cost reduction strategy offset by higher personnel and depreciation and amortization from our ongoing investments in support of our strategy for future growth total operating expenses for fiscal 2020 were 77 billion on a nongaap basis and increased 1 over the prior year primarily driven by higher personnel offset by our overall cost reduction strategy 

nongaap financial results we use nongaap financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations as they may be nonrecurring or have no cash impact and may distort our longerterm operating trends we consider nongaap measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance starting in fiscal 2020 we revised our nongaap methodology to also exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisitionrelated costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation 

• gains and losses on equity investments gains and losses on equity investments include periodic noncash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment these longterm investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019 amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are noncash and are significantly affected by the timing frequency and size of our acquisitions rather than our core operations as such we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance 

• acquisitionrelated costs acquisitionrelated costs consist primarily of onetime transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations these costs include professional fees technology integration fees restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities it also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense postcombination we have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business 

• litigation provision during fiscal 2019 and 2018 we recorded a litigation provision of 370 million and 600 million respectively and related tax benefits of 83 million and 137 million respectively associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation the tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision under the us retrospective responsibility plan we recover the monetary liabilities related to the us covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

• charitable contributions  during fiscal 2018 we donated investment securities to the visa foundation and recognized a noncash general and administrative expense of 195 million before tax and recorded 193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as nonoperating income net of the related cash tax benefit of 51 million determined by applying applicable tax rates nongaap net income decreased by 49 million 

• remeasurement of deferred tax balances during fiscal 2020 in connection with the uk enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19 to 17 that was effective on april 1 2020 we

• transition tax on foreign earnings during fiscal 2018 in connection with the tax act requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income we recorded a onetime transition tax estimate of approximately 11 billion see note 19—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

• resolution of a tax item during fiscal 2020 we resolved a longoutstanding tax matter dating back more than 12 years relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering the resolution of this matter resulted in the recognition of a onetime charge to income tax expense of 28 million which we believe is not representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

• provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios 

• ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities 

• ensure payments on required litigation settlements 

• make planned capital investments in our business 

• pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and 

• invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs and earn additional income 

based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 



operating activiti es cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower net income higher client incentive payments and timing of settlement 

investing activities cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities combined with fewer investment security purchases lower purchase consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash and restricted cash acquired due to fewer acquisitions and lower purchases of other investments 

financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes the absence of the deferred purchase consideration payment made in the prior year and lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid see note 10—debt and note 15—stockholders’ equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide we believe that cash flow generated from operations in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

availableforsale debt securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 36 billion are classified as current and are available to meet shortterm liquidity needs the remaining noncurrent investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however they are also generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30 2020 see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report

table of content s 

various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlements in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions in general during fiscal 2020 we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of 452 million we hold approximately 77 billion of available liquidity globally as of september 30 2020 in the form of cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle 

us covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the us covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation are payable from the us litigation escrow account in september 2018 visa and other defendants entered into an amended settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages which superseded and amended the 2012 settlement agreement in december 2019 the district court granted final approval of the amended settlement agreement relating to claims by the damages class which was subsequently appealed settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative injunctive relief class are ongoing 

during fiscal 2020 we have reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40 of the visabranded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the amended settlement agreement with the damages class plaintiffs at september 30 2020 the us litigation escrow account had an available balance of 09 billion for settlement with optout merchants 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the us covered litigation including ve territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings could give rise to future liquidity needs 

common stock repurchases during fiscal 2020 we repurchased 44 million shares of our class a common stock in the open market for 81 billion as of september 30 2020 our january 2020 program had remaining authorized funds of 55 billion see note 15—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

dividends  during fiscal 2020 we declared and paid 27 billion in dividends at a quarterly rate of 030 per share on october 23 2020 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 032 per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and c common stock and series a uki and europe preferred stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 703 million in connection with this dividend on december 1 2020 see note 15—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by the board of directors all preferred and class b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the us as a result of the acquisition of visa europe we assumed the obligations related to visa europe’s defined benefit plan primarily consisting of the uk pension plans our policy with respect to our us qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in september of each year an amount not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our us nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis in relation to the visa europe uk pension plans our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed with the uk pension plan trustees in fiscal 2020 we made contributions to our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans of 3 million and to our visa europe’s uk pension plans of 22 million in fiscal 2021 given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding 

table of content s 

our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans and visa europe’s uk defined benefit pension plans by approximately 2 million and 10 million respectively the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences see note 11—pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures decreased slightly during fiscal 2020 we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives 

senior notes a principal payment of 30 billion is due on december 14 2020 on our fixedrate senior notes issued in december 2015 for which we have sufficient liquidity see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

acquisitions in fiscal 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire plaid inc for 53 billion we will pay approximately 49 billion of cash and 04 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration on november 5 2020 the us department of justice filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california seeking a permanent injunction to prevent visa from acquiring plaid see note 2—acquisitions and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet arrangements other than purchase order commitments as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below 

indemnifications 

we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

table of content s 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2020 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities 



1 amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal also see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

2 represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction for obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent 

3 includes operating leases for premises and equipment which range in original lease terms from less than one year to twentysix years 

4 amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax net of foreign tax credit carryovers on certain foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries see note 19—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

5 includes expected dividend amount of 703 million as dividends were declared on october 23 2020 and will be paid on december 1 2020 to all holders of record of visa’s common and preferred stock as of november 13 2020 

6 we have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of 20 billion as of september 30 2020 at september 30 2020 we had also accrued 233 million of interest and 31 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions we cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements if any associated with our uncertain tax positions therefore no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table 

7 we evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above and may result in a wide range of amounts see note 11—pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report and the liquidity and capital resources s ection of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

8 future cash payments for longterm contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume these agreements which range in terms from less than one to fifteen years can provide card issuance andor conversion support volumegrowth targets or marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements as of september 30 2020 we have 44 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

table of content s 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into longterm incentive agreements with financial institution clients merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume increasing visa product acceptance winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance these estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using clientreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients merchants and business partners 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual performance is not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2020 client incentives represented 23 of gross revenues 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss if any in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on management’s understanding of the litigation profile the specifics of each case our history with similar proceedings advice of inhouse and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

we have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation however our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plan’s mechanisms include the use of the us litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the us litigation escrow account balance our europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liabilities and losses relating to the covered period subject to certain limitations and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the european commission proceedings or any other matter see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

table of content s 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated nonfunctional currency denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

at september 30 2020 and 2019 the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 39 billion and 31 billion respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2020 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the functional currencies at september 30 2020 is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately 210 million or loss of approximately 260 million respectively on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts the gain or loss from this hypothetical strengthening or weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain or loss on our cash flows from foreign currencydenominated revenues and payments see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 13—derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of visa europe is the euro translation from the euro to the us dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10 change in the euro against the us dollar compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2020 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 22 billion see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

table of content s 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our statements of operations or cash flows have been nor are they expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2020 and 2019 were 40 billion and 18 billion respectively the fair value of our adjustablerate debt securities were 20 billion and 46 billion at september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in fair value of approximately 35 million on our investment securities at september 30 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would create an estimated increase in fair value of approximately 72 million on our investment securities at september 30 2020 

in fiscal 2019 we entered into interest rate and crosscurrency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our us dollar denominated fixedrate payments into euro denominated floatingrate payments by entering into interest rate swaps we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately 30 million in annual interest expense see note 13—derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

equity investment risk 

as of september 30 2020 and 2019 the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities was 10 billion and 07 billion respectively these investments are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings a decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies we regularly review our nonmarketable equity securities for possible impairment which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs and the viability of its business model 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2020 and 2019 our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 11 billion and projected benefit obligations were 09 billion at each year end a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate as of september 30 2020 would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 221 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 44 million in pension cost 

at september 30 2020 and 2019 our nonus defined benefit pension plan assets were 05 billion at each year end and projected benefit obligations were 06 billion and 05 billion respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate as of september 30 2020 would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 194 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 17 million in pension cost 

we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2021 if any which would be made in september 2021

ecommerce has drastically evolved since the first online purchase was made on the visa network 25 years ago digital commerce growth is outpacing physical retail growth and we expect this to continue this presents an opportunity to evolve both the security and consumer experience around ecommerce as a result we are helping to transform the digital checkout experience by adding more security and removing friction with the launch of click to pay enabled by the emv® secure remote commerce specifications click to pay simplifies the checkout experience eliminating the need for a consumer to enter payment details each time they are purchasing digital services or shopping online this means greater consistency and fewer steps at checkout regardless of one’s payment choice in october 2019 click to pay went live with select merchants in the us and we expect full commercial migration of visa checkout to happen in early 2020 consumers can click to pay with confidence when they see a common checkout button with network logos and a stylized depiction of a fast forward icon  1   



growing access and acceptance 

a key component of how we expand our business focuses on growing access and increasing acceptance of our products around the world mobile connectivity new acceptance devices untethered to landline infrastructure and new partnerships are enabling visa payments in categories where card acceptance has typically been low such as rent parking and vending machines we accomplish this in a few ways 

drive new acceptance categories to uncover additional growth  we continue to expand our acceptance footprint in both mature and emerging markets and we remain committed to growing access and acceptance so that businesses and devices are enabled to send and receive funds via the visa network for example visa has grown acceptance in the us vending machine category by enabling more than two million devices as new acceptance locations which still leaves an estimated 50 percent of vending machines available for upgrade street parking represents a similar opportunity 

ensuring seamless experiences for crossborder transactions as commerce continues to flow across borders we are simplifying and streamlining how funds flow for both consumers and businesses crossborder ecommerce is also a growing opportunity consumers purchasing something from a foreign website are expected to account for 900 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2020 representing an estimated 22 percent share of the global ecommerce market 2   

enhancing inclusive financial access  according to the world bank 17 billion people worldwide still lack access to formal financial services which means they do not have access to the services that can help facilitate the growth of their economic livelihood as part of the world bank’s goal of universal financial access by 2020 in 2015 we committed to reaching 500 million consumers by 2020 at the end of 2018 we reached 396 million consumers worldwide with firsttime access to a digital payment product through a visabranded account in partnership with local financial institutions 

our scan to pay service has emerged as one of our most successful lowcost acceptance solutions for merchants enabling the growth of digital payments in developing economies and remote locations in some countries the infrastructure for traditional payments technology simply may not exist with scan to pay a business needs only to display a qr code to accept digital payments saving the cost time and complexity of installing a terminal and telecommunications wiring scan to pay is already live in parts of africa eastern europe the middle east and asia with plans to expand into emerging markets of all sizes and regions 

in india we continue to work with local acquirers to expand access and strengthen consumer demand for electronic payments the total acceptance points in india have expanded to more than five million including more than one million qr points this year in mexico we are executing a program to grow the penetration of electronic payments supporting the introduction of mobile pointofsale mpos and new acceptance technologies through our payment facilitator and acquirer partners 

our social impact work also supports women’s empowerment and the expansion of financial inclusion through programs that support skilldevelopment and access to networks and financial services for under and unbanked populations 

in january 2019 we launched she’s next empowered by visa which connects women business owners to their communities funding options and payment technologies through workshops training and mentorship to date visa has signed up and hosted women entrepreneurs at workshops across north america including atlanta los angeles new york city toronto and washington dc 

open partnership model 

for more than 60 years mutually beneficial partnerships have been fundamental to visa’s business model we traditionally have operated in a fourparty model facilitating transactions between issuers acquirers merchants and account holders as the payment ecosystem grows so too does visa’s partnership model today our partnerships extend to technology companies fintechs governments and nongovernmental organizations 



fintechs continue to be key enablers around the world in helping to expand access through electronic payments open new points of acceptance drive new payment flows and create new ways to pay and be paid visa has the ability to help these companies grow and scale their payment innovations around the world with increased safety and speed visa is continuing to increase its reach and scope to address fintech needs by partnering directly with them and with the platforms that service them around the world

ventures 

visa continues to make strategic investments in some companies that are enriching the broader payments ecosystem through these strategic investments visa seeks to promote complementary valueadded services enable new use cases and expand the distribution and utility of our payments network 

2 new payment flows 

over the last several years visa has invested in expanding beyond c2b payments to capture growth in new payment flows such as p2p b2c b2b and g2c payments today partners are increasingly using visa’s network infrastructure and capabilities to enable visa to unlock a growing market opportunity 

visa direct 

visa direct continues to be one of the most meaningful ways in which we are capturing new types of payments that were previously made by cash check or account clearing house ach visa direct visa’s realtime 3  push payments service reverses the traditional card payment flow by allowing payment originators through their acquirer to push funds directly to cards better meeting consumer and business needs for example a ride sharing company can pay its drivers after a shift by transferring their pay directly to a visa product visa direct helps enable domestic and crossborder payouts for consumers and small businesses in more than 170 countries its capabilities modernize money movement offering enhanced choice and convenience in how money is sent and received we have announced several visa direct partnerships that have helped drive transaction growth to more than 100 percent yearoveryear growth this year 



today visa direct powers seven of the major p2p platforms in the us in the last year visa direct transactions have been sent from 90 countries to the more than 170 countries where visa direct is currently available 

crossborder payments have continued to be a focal point for visa direct with key partnerships announced throughout the year with visa direct visa is extending the reach and capabilities of our global network to create a payment solution that is less constrained by time borders or networks 

earthport 

in july 2019 visa acquired earthport which provides crossborder payment services to banks money transfer service providers and businesses via one of the world’s largest independent ach networks before earthport visa could reach about half of the world’s bank accounts accessing them using visa direct and sending money to visa credentials such as debit or credit cards through a combination of the existing visa network and the addition of the earthport network visa clients will soon be able to push payments to the majority of the world’s banked population reaching more than 99 percent of bank accounts in 88 countries including the top 50 markets our vision is to enable our clients to reach bank accounts of consumers and small businesses in almost 200 countries via a single connection integration efforts are underway and we expect to launch a pilot of our first fully integrated visa direct and earthport experience by the end of the 2019 calendar year 

b2b 

we are also extending our network with b2b payments businesses spend an estimated 120 trillion each year offering tremendous room for us to continue to grow our business our strategy is twofold invest in and grow our existing commercial card solutions and capture new payment flows by innovating in the noncard payments space

4 foundational 

the foundations of our business are our technology security brand and talent 

technology 

visa’s technology platform consists of software hardware data centers and a vast telecommunications infrastructure each with a distinct architecture and operational footprint wrapped with several layers of security and protection technologies together these systems deliver the secure convenient and reliable service that our clients and consumers expect of the visa brand 

software 

as part of our global technology environment we build and securely operate hundreds of commercial applications using a diverse set of technologies   our software powers the core functions of our transaction processing — including authorization clearing and settlement and risk scoring — as well as all of our valueadded services these applications together work to provide essential services to the payments ecosystem 

hardware 

we rely on a diverse array of sophisticated infrastructure systems that are tailored to our services visas infrastructure is designed and configured with layers of redundancies we have multiple instances of our software running on separate pieces of hardware which is designed to provide continuous availability our disaster recovery capabilities are tiered so that our realtime transaction processing services can be continuously available 

data centers 

visa operates six data centers that are a critical part of our global processing environment and are built with the capacity to support visa’s growing power cooling and space needs all of our data centers have high redundancy of network connectivity power and cooling designed to provide continuous availability of systems we are continuing to reduce the carbon footprint of our data centers by deploying efficiency improvement strategies including led lighting variable airflow automation controls and hotandcold air containment technologies 

telecommunications   

we connect our clients and partners to visa’s data centers through a massive telecommunications network covering more than 10 million route miles each network node is connected through redundant links designed to provide high levels of security availability and performance for our products and services 

security 

in parallel with our role in advancing the security of the broader payments ecosystem visa remains committed to championing cybersecurity our multifaceted security approach includes deploying security tools that help keep our clients and consumers safe while providing solutions that make visa the best way to pay and be paid 

we invest significantly in our comprehensive approach to cybersecurity at visa we deploy security technologies to protect against data confidentiality integrity and availability risks emphasizing core cybersecurity capabilities to minimize risk exposure our indepth security approach applies multiple layers of protection to reduce the risk of any single control failing these measures include the following 

 for example visa uses ai and deep learning technology to monitor our network and understand the threats aimed at our company our platform collects billions of security logs each day providing insight across the network and within our infrastructure we combine this data with external intelligence on attacks observed outside of our data centers and network using machine learning tools we focus on the events that appear to pose a risk enabling our cybersecurity team to intervene we operate this platform globally with teams in multiple time zones detecting and responding 24x7x365 

brand 

the visa brand is one of the world’s most recognized trusted and valuable brands anchored on the notion that visa is “everywhere you want to be” the visa brand stands for acceptance security convenience speed and reliability in recognition of its strength among clients and consumers the visa brand consistently ranks highly in multiple brand studies including 1 on forbes world’s best regarded companies 2019 5 on brandz top 100 most valuable global brands 2019 forbes world’s most valuable brands and interbrand’s best global brands among others 

our brand strength helps us to deliver added value to financial institutions merchants clients and partners through compelling brand expressions a widerange of products and services and innovative marketing efforts in a consumer study by visa in 16 countries when consumers see the visa logo they are 35 times more likely to think the website is more secure 

in fiscal year 2019 we renewed our 25year relationship with the national football league and continued our global sponsorship of fifa the international olympic committee and the international paralympic committee visa is the only brand in the world that is a top sponsor of these properties and is also the largest sponsor of women’s football in the world at the upcoming olympic and paralympic games tokyo 2020 this opportunity will be on full display when we will use our brand and technology to bring japan’s vision for a future of digital payments to life 

talent 

visa’s workforce continues to grow increasing from approximately 17000 employees in fiscal year 2018 to 19500 employees in fiscal year 2019 this growth has been fueled in part by acquisitions with growth in the regions outpacing growth in the san francisco bay area at the end of fiscal year 2019 visa’s global workforce was 59 percent male and 41 percent female increasing the representation of women and underrepresented minorities remain an area of focus for management visa’s commitment to diversity recruiting includes partnering with organizations such as afrotech anitaborg catalyst diversity best practices the national society of black engineers the society of hispanic professional engineers watermark  silicon valley conference for women women in cybersecurity women in payments and many others to support and develop a diverse talent pipeline visa is committed to pay equity for employees doing similar work regardless of gender race or ethnicity and conducts pay equity analyses on an annual basis 

we assess employee engagement through our annual employee survey which provides feedback on a variety of topics such as company direction and strategy diversity and inclusion individual development collaboration and trust for the second year in a row we had an exceptional response rate of 95 percent with improvement in the survey results across the board and no items with notably declining scores 

intellectual property 

we own and manage the visa brand which stands for acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our portfolio of visaowned trademarks are important to our business generally trademark registrations are valid indefinitely as long as they are in use andor maintained we give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network we also own a number of patents patent applications and other intellectual property relating to payment solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the us and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

competition 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change existing and emerging competitors compete with visa’s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce mobile payments blockchain technology and digital currencies these advances are enabling new entrants many of which depart from traditional network payment models in certain countries the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition 

we compete against all forms of payment this includes paperbased payments primarily cash and checks and all forms of electronic payments our electronic payment competitors principally include 

global or multiregional networks  these networks typically offer a range of branded general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world examples include mastercard american express discover jcb and unionpay these competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the us or have a leading position in certain countries for example unionpay operates the sole domestic card acceptance mark in china and is expanding into other global markets see item 1a — risk factors — regulatory risks — governmentimposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia  based on available data visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world the following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2018 4  



4 mastercard american express jcb and discoverdiners club data sourced from the nilson report issue 1154 may 2019 mastercard excludes maestro and cirrus figures american express diners clubdiscover and jcb include business from thirdparty issuers jcb figures include other paymentrelated products and some figures are estimates 

local and regional networks  operated in many countries these networks often have the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial institutions these networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the us interac in canada eftpos in australia and mir in russia 

alternate payment providers  these providers often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels but are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale these companies may process payments using inhouse account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the ach global or local networks like visa or some combination of the foregoing in some cases these entities are both a partner and a competitor to visa 

ach and real time payment rtp networks  these networks are often governed by local regulations primarily focused on interbank transfers many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments we also compete with closedloop payment systems emerging payments networks wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers 

payment processors  we compete with payment processors for the processing of visa transactions these processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other networks processors and other thirdparties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance security convenience speed and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions merchants fintechs governments nongovernmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018 accounted for more than 30 percent of our net revenues in those years 

working capital 

payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

government regulation 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used the most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below for further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business see item 1arisk factorsregulatory risks  

anticorruption antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also subject to antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac in the us therefore we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive ofac trade sanctions currently cuba iran north korea syria and crimea or that are included on ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons to issue or acquire visa cards or engage in transactions using our services 

governmentimposed market participation and restrictions certain governments including china india indonesia russia thailand and vietnam have taken actions to promote domestic payments systems andor certain issuers payments networks or processors by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers impose local ownership requirements on processors require data localization or mandate domestic processing be done in that country 

interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer act doddfrank act in the us limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions the european union’s eu ifr limits interchange rates in europe as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia and the central bank of brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange 

internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol 

network exclusivity and routing in the us the doddfrank act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr’s prohibition in europe on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card 

nosurcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation 

privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations that could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and datahandling practices create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data 

supervisory oversight of the payments industry visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the us for example the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to us financial institutions the federal banking agencies comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration visa also may be separately examined by the bureau of consumer financial protection as a service provider to the banks that issue visabranded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countriesregions including europe russia ukraine and the united kingdom as discussed below have recognized or designated visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil and hong kong 

european regulations and supervisory oversight visa in europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the european economic area eea visa europe is designated as a recognized payment system in the united kingdom bringing it within the scope of the bank of england’s supervisory powers and subject to various requirements including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the united kingdom’s financial system visa europe is also subject to the european central bank’s oversight whose main focus is on the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area including the security operational reliability and business continuity of the payment systems furthermore visa europe is regulated by the united kingdom’s payment systems regulator psr which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices systems rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the united kingdom and ensuring payments meet account holder needs the psr is also the regulator responsible for monitoring visa europe’s compliance with the ifr in the united kingdom the ifr regulates interchange rates within europe requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decisionmaking purposes within the eu and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing national competent authorities in the eu are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in their markets 

there are other regulations in the european union that impact our business as discussed above including privacy and data protection antibribery antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions other recent regulatory changes in europe such as the second payment services directive psd2 require among other things that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging nonfinancial institution players psd2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences 

as discussed in item 1a — risk factors — business risks — the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results brexit could lead to further legal and regulatory complexity in europe 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues including mobile payment transactions tokenization access rights for nonfinancial institutions money transfer identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us furthermore following the passage of psd2 in europe several countries including australia brazil canada hong kong and mexico are contemplating granting various types of access rights to thirdparty processors including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients which could have implications for our business as well

 item 1a risk factors 

regulatory risks 

we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results  

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations see item 1 — business — government regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulations on us our clients and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules affect our existing contractual arrangements increase our compliance costs require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties including competitors in an undesirable manner and reduce our revenue opportunities as discussed in more detail below we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion pointofsale transaction rules and practices privacy data use or protection licensing requirements and associated product technology as a result the visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws such as antimoney laundering anticorruption competition privacy and sanctions and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve however we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal penalties litigation investigations and proceedings and damage to our global brands and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa products our clients issue the volume of payments we process our revenues our brands our competitive positioning our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services the quality and types of products and services we offer the countries in which our products are used and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products all of which could harm our business 

increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees merchant discount rates operating rules risk management protocols and other related practices could harm our business  

regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see item 1 business —government regulation for more information  in the us and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction in the context of credit and debit transactions those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers the reverse is true for certain transactions like atm interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 

interchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example regulations adopted by the us federal reserve cap the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent the doddfrank act also limits issuers’ and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacts our business the eu’s ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and crossborder transactions within the eea 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively eu member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories furthermore the european commission is in the process of conducting an impact assessment of the ifr which could potentially result in lower andor additional interchange fee caps and restrictions countries in other parts of the world including the latin america region have either adopted or are exploring interchange caps for example in march 2017 argentina’s central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions in march 2018 brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors’ closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees or reducing certain benefits to consumers which make our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us including reductions in the fees that we charge which may directly impact our revenues 

in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business for example many governments including but not limited to governments in india and turkey are using regulation to further drive down merchant discount rates which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions some countries in latin america like peru and chile are relying on antitrust driven regulatory actions that can have implications for how the payments ecosystem and four party model operate the payment system regulator’s review of the acquiring market in the united kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business with increased merchant lobbying we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services or to have the other network’s functionality or brand marks on our products as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence for instance new products and capabilities including tokenization push payments and noncard based payment flows eg b2b connect could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered in addition the european union’s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies 

we are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets including brazil russia the united kingdom and within the european union this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally as well as localized risk management or governance increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system including allowing nontraditional financial technology companies to act as issuers or acquirers additionally regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles 

finally regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law regulation or regulatory outcome in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings for example our settlement with the european commission on crossborder interchange rates could draw the attention of regulators in other parts of the world similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments or vice versa for instance the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 

governmentimposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia  

governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks brands and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations to varying degrees these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks in the future public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments processing be performed entirely within that country which would prevent us from managing the endtoend processing of certain transactions 

in russia legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions the central bank controlled national payment card system nspk is the only entity allowed to process domestically in china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the people’s bank of china pboc to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural steps remain uncertain the approval process might require several years and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks 

recent regulatory initiatives in india also suggest growing nationalistic priorities including a data localization mandate passed by the government which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers furthermore regional groups of countries such as the gulf cooperation countries in the middle east and a number of countries in southeast asia are considering or may consider efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions the african development bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability geopolitical events including sanctions trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify any or all of these activities which could adversely affect our business 

due to our inability to manage the endtoend processing of transactions for cards in certain countries eg russia and thailand we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or thirdparty processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or onshore processing 

cobadging and coresidency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing for example in china certain banks have issued dualbranded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks the pboc is contemplating that dualbranded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china’s domestic payments market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visaonly branded cards for international travel and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license however notwithstanding such efforts the phase out of dualbranded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in china 

mir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china respectively and are actively pursuing international expansion plans which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule which requires that international transactions on visa cards be routed over visanet furthermore although regulatory barriers shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china respectively alternate payment providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce offline and crossborder payments which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china recently with strong backing from china’s government a new digital transaction routing system known as netlink was established the pboc allowed alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in netlink it and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with other international payments networks  

in general national laws that protect domestic providers or processing may increase our costs decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products services and innovations force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets and create new competitors all of which could harm our business 

laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us  

our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for example the eu’s general data protection regulation gdpr extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the company’s location the law requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data although we have an extensive data privacy program that addresses the gdpr requirements our ongoing efforts to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws such as the new california consumer privacy act effective as of january 2020 and the brazilian general data protection law effective as of february 2020 may entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer in addition india has adopted a data localization law that requires all payment system operators to store domestic transaction data only in india such data localization requirements have cost implications for us impact our ability to utilize the efficiencies and value of our global network and could affect our strategy furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in tax laws  

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service the uk’s hm revenue  customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions or changes resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development program of work related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and global baseerosion proposal may also materially affect our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

litigation risks 

we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place  

we are involved in numerous litigation matters investigations and proceedings asserted by civil litigants governments and enforcement bodies alleging among other things violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law and intellectual property law these are referred to as “actions” in this section details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report these actions are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable in any material action particularly in a large class action lawsuit such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or we incur liability arising from a government investigation we may be required to pay significant awards settlements or fines in addition settlement terms judgments or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify among other things the default interchange reimbursement rates we set the visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules our fees or pricing or the way we do business these actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators investigators governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions which may lead to additional actions against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them even if visa is not a defendant 

for certain actions like those that are us covered litigation or ve territory covered litigation as described in note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

business risks 

we face intense competition in our industry  

the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors or methods of payment emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multiregional networks other domestic and closedloop payments systems and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients other emerging payment providers such as fintechs and other digital payments and technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels 

our competitors may develop substantially better technology have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer more effective innovative or a wider range of programs products and services they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions which could hurt our financial results and prospects 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternate payments systems like alipay and wechat pay operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the doddfrank act or the us federal reserve’s fednow initiatives may provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models and may create new competitors including in some cases the government itself similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments alternate payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example 



 as the competitive landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses products services and practices we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth 

our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain  

our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue nonvisa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our net revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients in order to stay competitive we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments adapt to regulatory changes and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include upfront cash payments fee discounts rebates credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options market pressures on pricing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits 

in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or cobrand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 

merchants’ and processors’ continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business  

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa products certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions such as the us canada and europe to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory enforcement filing lawsuits and in some cases refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products for example in the us certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact the cost of payment card acceptance in addition to ongoing litigation related to the us migration to emvcapable cards and pointofsale terminals us merchantaffiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process and some policymakers have concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council in the development of payment card standards additionally some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transactions to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers’ usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement andor litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business 

we depend on relationships with financial institutions acquirers processors merchants and other third parties  

as noted above our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for instance we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace we engage in discussions with merchants acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we also engage in many payment card cobranding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem whether as for example an issuer merchant or digital wallet provider as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships in addition we depend on our clients and third parties including vendors and suppliers to process transactions properly provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and otherwise adhere to our operating rules to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their visabranded payment products which could harm our business and reputation 

our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation or if we experience brand disintermediation  

our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business we believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the pointofsale and decrease the value of our brand our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including authorization clearing and settlement service disruptions data security breaches compliance failures by visa including our employees agents clients partners or suppliers negative perception of our industry the industries of our clients or visaaccepting merchants illperceived actions by clients partners or other third parties such as sponsorship or cobrand partners and fraudulent risky controversial or illegal activities using our payment products if we are unable to maintain our reputation the value of our brand may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients account holders and the public as well as impact our business 

global economic political market and social events or conditions may harm our business  

our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in addition more than half of our net revenues are earned outside the us international crossborder transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy therefore adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics or other local or global health issues political uncertainties international hostilities armed conflict or unrest and natural disasters could impact our operations our clients our activities in a particular location and crossborder travel and spend geopolitical trends towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions the current trade environment reduces the likelihood of having our bank card clearing institution application in china approved in addition any decline in crossborder travel and spend could impact the number of crossborder transactions we process and our currency exchange activities which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues 

a decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions could reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which ultimately impact our revenues they may also implement costreduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced valueadded services from us 

any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if clients default on their settlement obligations it may also impact our liquidity any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue 

our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity  

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa operating rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 11—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results  

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government initiated the exit process under article 50 of the treaty of the european union commencing a period of up to two years for the united kingdom and the other eu member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal which was subsequently postponed until january 31 2020 uncertainty over the terms of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the united kingdom and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results 

brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and european union we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the european union and as a result our visa operating rules and contractual commitments in the united kingdom and the rest of the european union may be impacted in addition applications may need to be made for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member states following brexit these factors may impact our ability to operate and process data in the european union and united kingdom seamlessly this and other brexitrelated issues may require changes to our legal entity structure andor operations in the united kingdom and the european union any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

failure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth  

the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity payment technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrencies and new authentication technologies such as biometrics distributed ledger and blockchain technologies as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated moreover some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or claims potentially impacting our development efforts andor requiring us to obtain licenses if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients impact our intellectual property or licensing rights harm our business and impact our future growth 

a disruption failure or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our business  

our cybersecurity and processing systems as well as those of financial institutions merchants and thirdparty service providers have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience errors interruptions delays or damage from a number of causes including power outages hardware software and network failures computer viruses malware or other destructive software internal design manual or usage errors cyberattacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters and severe weather conditions 

furthermore our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts we have been and may continue to be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions merchants or thirdparty processors we are also aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients and other instances where merchants and issuers have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders such attacks and breaches have resulted and may continue to result in fraudulent activity and ultimately financial losses to visa’s clients and it is difficult to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business 

numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes particularly on our internet applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our thirdparty service providers because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the security measures and procedures we our financial institution and merchant clients other merchants and thirdparty service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches cyberattacks or system failures in some cases the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards or whose hardware software or network services may be subject to error defect delay or outage although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats 

these events could significantly disrupt our operations impact our clients and consumers damage our reputation and brand result in litigation or claims violations of applicable privacy and other laws and regulatory scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties result in damages or changes to our business practices decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products decrease our volume revenues and future growth prospects and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise 

structural and organizational risks 

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments and may face risks and uncertainties as a result  

as part of our overall business strategy we make acquisitions and strategic investments we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 we may be unable to attract hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce including key management  

the talents and efforts of our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations have made it more difficult for employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which we have operations and could continue to impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters integrity innovation and collaboration could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success 

the conversions of our class b and class c common stock or series b and series c preferred stock into shares of class a common stock would result in voting dilution to and could impact the market price of our existing class a common stock  

the market price of our class a common stock could fall as a result of many factors under our us retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our us covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock our series b and series c preferred stock will become convertible into class a common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims conversion of our class b and class c common stock into class a common stock or our series b and series c preferred stock into class a common stock would increase the amount of class a common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class a common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class a common stockholders 

holders of our class b and c common stock and series b and series c preferred stock may have different interests than our class a common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions  

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock and in certain specified circumstances holders of our series b and series c preferred stock can vote on certain significant transactions with respect to our class b and c common stock these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series b and series c preferred stock voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series b and series c preferred stock would either i receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or ii receive securities cash or other property that is different from what our class a common stockholders would receive because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class a common stock are our current and former financial institution clients they may have interests that diverge from our class a common stockholders as a result the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class a common stockholders 

delaware law provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could make a merger takeover attempt or change in control difficult  

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable for example except for limited exceptions

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers merchants financial institutions businesses strategic partners and government entities our advanced transaction processing network visanet enables authorization clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products platforms and valueadded services 

financial overview our asreported us gaap and nongaap net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows 



 highlights for fiscal 2019  our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal 2019 reflects continued global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions we recorded net revenues of 230 billion for fiscal 2019  an increase of 11 over the prior year primarily reflecting continued growth in nominal payments volume nominal crossborder volume and processed transactions exchange rate movements in fiscal 2019  partially mitigated by our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately oneandahalf percentage points  

total operating expenses for fiscal 2019 were 80 billion  compared to 77 billion in fiscal 2018  the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing as we continue to invest in growing our business offset by a lower litigation provision 

nongaap financial results our financial results for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods as they are either nonrecurring or have no cash impact as such we believe the presentation of our nongaap financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 



nongaap operating expenses operating margin nonoperating income expense income before income taxes income tax provision effective income tax rate net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with us gaap the following tables reconcile our asreported financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap to the respective nongaap financial measures for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  







 interchange multidistrict litigation  during fiscal 2019  we recorded an additional accrual of 370 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to us covered litigation of 12 billion at september 30 2019  we also deposited 300 million of operating cash into the us litigation escrow account see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

reduction in asconverted shares during fiscal 2019  total asconverted class a common stock was reduced by 58 million shares at an average price of 15462 per share of the 58 million shares 56 million were repurchased in the open market using 86 billion of operating cash on hand additionally in september 2019 we deposited 300 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the us retrospective responsibility plan also we recovered 8 million of ve territory covered losses in accordance with the europe retrospective responsibility plan during fiscal 2019  the deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class a common stock because they reduce the class b common stock conversion rate and the uki and europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently reduce the asconverted class a common stock share count see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 14—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

common stock repurchases in january 2019  our board of directors authorized an additional 85 billion share repurchase program as of september 30 2019  the program had remaining authorized funds of 41 billion for share repurchase all share repurchase programs authorized prior to january 2019 have been completed see note 14—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

payments volume and processed transactions payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues during the three months ended december 31 2018 we updated our definition of payments volume to now include all disbursement volume related to visa direct in addition to the funding volume previously included all prior periods presented have been adjusted accordingly please refer to the operational performance data section of exhibit 991 on form 8k filed on january 30 2019 for more details on the impact from this update in payments volume definition 

nominal payments volume over the prior year posted low doubledigit growth in the us and in line with 2018 growth nominal international payments volume growth of 3 for the 12 months ended june 30 2019 1 was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the us dollar on a constantdollar basis which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended june 30 2019 and 2018 was 10 and 11 respectively growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments

financial information presentation 

net revenues 

our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visa products for purchased goods and services as well as the number of transactions processed on our network we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visa products our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants as well as establishing and earning these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our net revenues 

service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of visa payment services current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter’s pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives which are recognized in the same period the related volumes are transacted

results of operations 

net revenues 

the following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the us and internationally 



 the increase in net revenues in fiscal 2019 reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume nominal crossborder volume and processed transactions the increase in revenues were partially offset by increases in client incentives in fiscal 2019  

our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars exchange rate movements in fiscal 2019  as partially mitigated by our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately oneandahalf percentage points  

the following table sets forth the components of our net revenues 







operating expenses 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses 





nonoperating income expense 

the following table sets forth the components of our nonoperating income expense 



 

 



effective income tax rate 



the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 primarily due to 

 the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 transitioned the us tax system to a territorial system and lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21  the reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21 became effective on january 1 2018 in fiscal 2018 our statutory federal corporate tax rate was a blended rate of 245 which was reduced to 21 in fiscal 2019 the tax act enacted several new tax provisions effective for us on october 1 2018 most notably fdii and gilti 

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 



operating activiti es cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was positively impacted by continued growth in our underlying business fiscal 2019 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher payments in the current year from the litigation escrow account and the first installment payment of the transition tax in connection with the tax act partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business 

investing activities cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 was lower than the prior year due to higher proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities combined with fewer purchases partially offset by 07 billion of purchase consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash and restricted cash acquired and 05 billion of purchases of other investments 

financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 increased primarily due to higher class a common stock repurchases higher dividends paid and a 12 billion payment of the deferred purchase consideration related to the visa europe acquisition see note 14—stockholders’ equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide we believe that cash flow generated from operations in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

foreign earnings pursuant to the tax act we are required to pay us tax on most of the undistributed and untaxed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries accumulated as of december 31 2017 the transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the tax act as a result of the tax act we are no longer subject to incremental us federal tax on foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries in the event that we repatriate these earnings back to the us 

availableforsale debt securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 41 billion  are classified as current and are available to meet shortterm liquidity needs the remaining noncurrent investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however they are also generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30 2019  see note 9—debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

credit facility we have an unsecured 50 billion revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires on july 25 2024  there were no borrowings under the credit facility as of september 30 2019  see note 9—debt to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

universal shelf registration statement in july 2018 we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions this registration statement expires in july 2021 

us litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the us retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a us litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation will be payable when we fund the us litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock in september 2019 we deposited 300 million into the us litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report the balance in this account at september 30 2019  was 12 billion and is reflected as restricted cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the us covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2019  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlements in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions in general during fiscal 2019  we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of 574 million we hold approximately 75 billion of available liquidity globally as of september 30 2019  in the form of cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle 

us covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the us covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation are payable from the us litigation escrow account in september 2018 visa and other defendants entered into an amended settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages which superseded and amended the 2012 settlement agreement on november 7 2019 the district court held a hearing on whether to approve the amended settlement agreement we expect a decision by the district court in the first half of calendar year 2020 if approved the final settlement amount would be approximately 55 billion our share represents approximately 36 billion which would be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court no additional funds are required for this class settlement under the amended settlement agreement defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to 25 of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out of the settlement class visa’s portion of the maximum takedown payments which we expect to receive and is calculated to be 467 million would be returned to our us litigation escrow account this will increase our taxable income thereby increasing our taxes paid 

during september 2019 we deposited 300 million into the us litigation escrow account to address individual claims for members who have chosen to opt out of the amended settlement agreement at september 30 2019  the us litigation escrow account had an available balance of 12 billion  the funds in the us litigation escrow account as well as the 467 million takedown payments that we expect to be returned will be available for settlement with these optout merchants under the terms of the us retrospective responsibility plan when we make a deposit into the litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock are subject to dilution through a reduction to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock the us retrospective responsibility plan was created to insulate visa and our class a common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the us covered litigation including ve territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding could give rise to future liquidity needs 

reduction in asconverted shares during fiscal 2019  share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced asconverted class a common stock by 58 million at an average price of 15462 per share of the 58 million shares 56 million were repurchased in the open market using 86 billion of cash on hand additionally we deposited 300 million of operating cash into the us litigation escrow account previously established under the us retrospective responsibility plan the deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class a common stock because it reduces the class b conversion rate and consequently the asconverted class a common stock share count see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 14—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

in january 2019 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for 85 billion  this authorization has no expiration date as of september 30 2019  we had remaining authorized funds of 41 billion  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to january 2019 have been completed see note 14—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

dividends  during fiscal 2019  we declared and paid 23 billion in dividends on october 22 2019  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 030 per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and c common stock and series b and c preferred stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 673 million in connection with this dividend on december 3 2019  see note 14—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by the board of directors all preferred and class b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the us as a result of the acquisition of visa europe we assumed the obligations related to visa europe’s defined benefit plan primarily consisting of the uk pension plans our policy with respect to our us qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in september of each year an amount not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our us nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis in relation to the visa europe uk pension plans our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed with the uk pension plan trustees in fiscal 2019  we made contributions to our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans of 3 million  for visa europe’s uk pension plans we made contributions of 10 million in fiscal 2019  subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans in fiscal 2020  given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans and visa europe’s uk defined benefit pension plans by approximately 3 million and 10 million  respectively the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences see note 10—pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2019  due to investments in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives 

acquisitions in fiscal 2019 we acquired businesses using 07 billion of cash on hand primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash and restricted cash received these acquisitions will help visa’s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce in connection with our purchase of visa europe in june 2016 we were required to pay an additional €10 billion plus 4 compound annual interest on the third anniversary of the closing of the visa europe acquisition in june 2019 we paid €11 billion in fulfillment of this obligation see note 2—acquisitions and note 8—intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

derivative financial instruments 

in fiscal 2019 we entered into interest rate and crosscurrency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding 315 senior notes due december 2025 that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our us dollar denominated fixedrate payments into euro denominated floatingrate payments see note 6—fair value measurements and investments and note 12—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2019  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 135 billion of assets and 02 billion of liabilities none of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs see note 6—fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet arrangements other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below 

indemnifications 

we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 11—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2019  we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities 





critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into longterm incentive agreements with financial institution clients merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume increasing visa product acceptance winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance these estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using clientreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients merchants and business partners 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual performance is not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2019  client incentives represented 21 of gross revenues 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on management’s understanding of the litigation profile the specifics of each case our history with similar proceedings advice of inhouse and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

we have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation however our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plan’s mechanisms include the use of the us litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the us litigation escrow account balance our europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liabilities and losses relating to the covered period subject to certain limitations and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the european commission proceedings or any other matter see note 5—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans and note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 20—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated nonfunctional currency denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 31 billion and 37 billion at september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2019 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately 245 million or loss of approximately 300 million  respectively on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2019  the gain or loss from this hypothetical strengthening or weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain or loss on our cash flows from foreign currencydenominated revenues and payments see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 12—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of visa europe is the euro translation from the euro to the us dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10 change in the euro against the us dollar compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2019  would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 20 billion  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our operating results or cash flows have been nor are they expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2019 and 2018 were 18 billion and 51 billion  respectively the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 46 billion and 35 billion at september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in fair value of approximately 9 million on our investment securities at september 30 2019  

in fiscal 2019 we entered into interest rate and crosscurrency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our us dollar denominated fixedrate payments into euro denominated floatingrate payments by entering into interest rate swaps we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately 30 million in annual interest expense see note 12—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2019 and 2018  our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 11 billion at each year end and projected benefit obligations were 09 billion and 08 billion  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 220 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 43 million in pension cost 

at september 30 2019 and 2018  our nonus defined benefit pension plan assets were 05 billion and 04 billion  respectively and projected benefit obligations were 05 billion at each year end a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1 decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 182 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately 15 million in pension cost 

we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2020  if any which would be made in september 2020

 item 1 business 

overview 

sixty years ago in september 1958 the first bankamericard credit card was issued in fresno california bankamericard became visa in 1976 and expanded globally ten years ago in march 2008 visa inc completed the largest initial public offering at that time on the new york stock exchange these milestones have helped establish visa as one of the world’s leading payments technology companies 

though visa has evolved and grown over the course of the last six decades our fundamental business model has remained the same 

 in recent years we have evolved our organization to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels including ecommerce mobile and wearables 

 

 4 

 two years ago our industry reached a milestone when digital payments surpassed cash payments worldwide for the first time despite this growth we have a significant opportunity to displace cash payments in 2018 approximately 17 trillion of payments were conducted using cash and checks there is additional opportunity among new payment flows including persontoperson p2p businesstobusiness b2b businesstoconsumer b2c and governmenttoconsumer g2c payments 

visa’s network 

our fourparty model seeks to facilitate secure reliable and convenient transactions between financial institutions merchants and account holders through our advanced transaction processing network visanet visanet authorizes clears and settles a diverse range of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients with a wide range of products platforms and valueadded services 

in recent years we have broadened our network model to incorporate fintechs in an effort to deliver additional value to clients and consumers as digital payments evolve we are increasingly engaging new partners including messaging platforms technology providers and device manufacturers to capture new payment flows 

we believe our network is core to the growth of our business and the expansion of digital commerce globally 

 5 

account holder and merchant relationships are managed primarily by our financial institution clients and merchant acquirers including processors and independent service organizations 

visa is not a financial institution we do not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of visa products we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visa products interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our openloop payments network we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process but we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in addition we do not receive as revenue the fees that merchants are charged directly for acceptance by their acquirers 

 6 

strategic focus 

visa’s vision —  to be the best way to pay and be paid for everyone everywhere —  guides our purpose our mission —  to connect the world through the most innovative reliable and secure payments network enabling individuals businesses and economies to thrive —  is underpinned by seven strategic pillars 

transform technology 

visa is a technology company in recent years we have shifted our proprietary technology architecture to a more open architecture across our software hardware and networking platforms the visa developer platform provides application developers with access to certain of visa’s products services and technology via apis in an effort to enable business partners to create new commerce experiences and increase the speed and depth of payment innovations that leverage visa’s products services and technology    

champion security 

we have focused many of our investments partnerships and expertise to enhance the security of our network and to enable consumers and businesses to pay and be paid with confidence as payment methods evolve we are focused on the following four areas 

 

 

 



 7 

leverage our worldclass brand 

the visa brand is one of the world’s most recognized trusted and valuable brands anchored on the notion that visa is “everywhere you want to be” we believe the brand stands for acceptance security convenience speed and reliability in recognition of its strength among clients and consumers the visa brand is ranked highly in a number of brand studies including brandz top 100 most valuable global brands study forbes world’s most valuable brands interbrand’s best global brands and yougov brand index our brand strength helps us to deliver added value to financial institutions merchants clients and partners through compelling brand expressions a widerange of products and services and innovative marketing efforts 

develop the best talent 

visa’s employees are one of our most important assets visa’s approximately 17000 employees in 119 locations across the world embody our vision and drive our growth as a truly global enterprise with the integration of visa europe we are adding new talent and expertise to visa at the same time visa is building a culture of empowered leadership this focus is intended to provide functional and market leaders greater autonomy and authority to respond quickly and decisively to the needs of our clients and innovate to capture new digital commerce opportunities 

drive digital 

visa transactions today take place across a variety of devices and transaction types visa has developed various products partnerships and platforms in an effort to enable fast and secure commerce on cards phones laptops and other form factors visa offers a token service which can be used to replace payment card account numbers with a unique onetime use code or token in an effort to make transactions more secure in doing so we aim to increase consumer confidence in the security of devices and other solutions that are used to initiate and make payments 

in parallel visa is supporting and enabling our clients and partners to harness digital commerce opportunities through visa digital solutions visa digital solutions is a growing portfolio of visa payment services and authentication technologies that enable tokenization online commerce and push payment services to be securely embedded in new products our growing portfolio of visa payment services and authentication technologies enable tokenization and online commerce as well as facilitate secure costeffective p2p b2c b2b and g2c payment services   

deepen partnerships 

visa’s business has been built on a foundation of longstanding and mutuallybeneficial partnerships we seek to differentiate our relationships with our clients by offering access to our global network payment products valueadded services and payment expertise we have also expanded our partnerships to include technology leaders governments nongovernmental organizations and fintechs 

expand access 

the core of visa’s mission —  to connect the world —  is based on the belief that everyone everywhere should have access to the speed convenience and reliability of digital payments 

 8 

despite the best efforts of governments and the private sector an estimated 17 billion people worldwide lack access to safe and reliable financial services mobile connectivity new acceptance devices untethered to landline infrastructure and new partnerships are enabling digital payments in remote and challenging environments 

in 2018 we made a strategic decision to focus much of our social impact efforts on enabling micro and small enterprises to succeed visa and the visa foundation are committed to help lowincome financially underserved micro and small enterprises around the world this initiative is good for small enterprises and the global economy sixtyfive percent of all new private sector jobs in the us and 60 percent of new jobs in developing economies are in the small and microbusiness sector

key initiatives 

visa  europe integration 

in fiscal 2018 we completed the final stages of the visa europe technology migration which was a multiyear process that brought our european clients onto visanet the unified global platform aims to increase the speedtomarket resilience and availability of innovative solutions to our european clients as a result clients will see expanded services including greater support of visa direct transactions realtime risk management tokenization and global dispute capabilities in addition we migrated the fraud scoring and case management service in europe to our global platform clients will benefit from a unified security architecture built on multiple redundant layers of cyber defense designed to protect them from data security breaches and service disruptions 

interchange multidistrict litigation 

we reached a damages class settlement in the us interchange multidistrict litigation mdl in september 2018 the settlement has been submitted to the district court for preliminary approval and following such approval merchant class members will be given the opportunity to opt out of or object to the settlement the district court will then determine whether to finally approve the settlement this damages class settlement does not resolve the injunctive relief class claims seeking modifications to network rules see note 17—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data   of this report for a discussion of the mdl

how  we work with partners – global innovation network visa developer platform certifications and startups 

our global innovation network with ten locations in key markets such as dubai london miami san francisco and singapore fosters collaboration with our financial institution and merchant clients partners and developers to help spur the creation of innovative payment and commerce applications and solutions by providing access to visa capabilities through apis the visa developer platform is designed to enable global partners to transform ideas into new digital commerce payment or related experiences or solutions for example the visa everywhere initiative is a global innovation program active in more than 80 countries since 2015 that tasks startups to solve commerce challenges further enhance their own product propositions and provide new solutions for our network of partners 

we also make investments in companies around the world that we believe may further our vision and strategic objectives support deeper engagement with key partners or expand access to payment solutions worldwide in 2018 we made several investments in the fintech industry and unveiled a new program in europe which we are implementing around the world called fintech fasttrack the fintech fasttrack program provides an accelerated and simplified onboarding process for startup and early growthstage companies to become visa issuers in addition through the visa ready certification program we provide the structure that allows partners to introduce devices software and solutions that can securely initiate or accept visa payments 

separately visa also launched an investment program to invest up to 100 million to support the fintech ecosystem with the focus on supporting startup businesses that are innovating in open banking and those using emerging technologies that have the potential to create new commerce experiences 

products  services 

for decades our growth has been driven by the strength of our core business solutions credit debit and prepaid products as well as our global atm network the ability to access available funds a line of credit or a prepaid account has provided consumers and businesses flexibility and convenience 

core products 

business solutions  we offer a portfolio of business payment solutions including small business corporate travel cards purchasing cards virtual accounts and disbursement accounts covering most major industry segments around the world business solutions are designed to bring efficiency controls and automation to small businesses commercial and government payment processes ranging from employee travel to fully integrated invoicebased payables 

credit credit cards are issued by financial institutions to allow consumers and businesses to access credit to pay for goods and services visa does not extend credit however we provide combinations of card benefits including technology authorization fraud tools and brand support that financial institutions use to enable their credit products we also partner with our clients on product design consumer segmentation and consumer experience design to help financial institutions better deliver products and services that match their consumers’ needs 

debit debit cards are issued by financial institutions to allow consumers and small businesses to purchase goods and services using funds held in their demand deposit accounts debit cards enable cardholders to transact —  in person online or via mobile —  without needing cash or checks and without accessing a line of credit visa provides a strong brand the network infrastructure and processing acceptance product features and support risk tools and services and industry expertise to help issuers optimize their debit offerings 

prepaid prepaid products draw from a designated balance funded by individuals corporations or governments prepaid cards address many consumeruse cases and needs including general purpose reloadable payroll government and corporate disbursements healthcare gift and travel prepaid cards also play an important part in financial inclusion bringing payment solutions to those with limited or no access to traditional banking products 

global atm the visaplus global atm network provides account holders with convenient cash access in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide through issuing and acquiring partnerships with both financial institutions and independent atm operators

processing  infrastructure 

visanet is designed to be one of the world’s most secure reliable and interoperable global payments networks visanet is built on a highperformance architecture that allows us to analyze each authorization we process in real time and provide valueadded processing services such as risk scoring and tokenization it provides the infrastructure for delivering innovation and other payment system enhancements for domestic payments and crossborder international transactions globally 

visanet consists of five main areas 

software  sitting at the center of visa’s technology platform is a set of commercial software applications powering authorization clearing and settlement as well as valueadded services for our clients 

hardware  our software runs on powerful servers mainframes and data storage systems that are capable of processing more than 65000 transaction messages per second 

processing centers  our hardware resides in four global processing centers which are located on three continents our global processing centers are designed to synchronize in real time so that if one system encounters an issue transactions are rerouted almost instantly and automatically to another 

telecommunications  we connect our clients and partners to visanet through a global private telecommunications network that is designed for redundancies and to provide security and availability of our products and services 

security  finally we have multiple layers of advanced security tools to protect our technology footprint at the enterprise network operating system and application levels to strengthen our security and cyber defenses we continue to deploy new tools and measures to help safeguard our network and the wider ecosystem from hackers and cyberattacks 

together these systems are designed to deliver security convenience and service that our account holders clients and partners expect of the visa brand 

digital   product 

visa direct  visa direct is our push payment platform that facilitates fund transfers by our financial institution clients which allows businesses governments and consumers to utilize visanet processing capabilities to transfer funds from an originating account to another account via card credentials the transfer is made with the same level of security protection network reliability and easeofuse that visa uses for other types of transactions push payments represent one of our biggest incremental payment flow opportunities this global platform enables faster payments solutions for a range of new use cases including p2p b2b and b2c disbursements crossborder remittances and bill pay 

visa direct is currently operating in more than 150 countries over seventy of those countries are enabled for fast funds acceptance through visa direct with funds typically posted in seconds and no longer than 30 minutes global growth for visa direct means enabling acquirers processors and merchants to leverage their existing network connections to build new services capabilities and solutions with global scale and reach 

in certain emerging markets push payments allow consumers to use their enabled mobile applications to “push” money to a business account conveniently using an alias eg qr code for payment of goods and services visa’s qr code scantopay functionality enables lowcost quick to market alternatives for promoting digital payment acceptance at small and medium size merchants 

visa token service  the visa token service vts replaces sensitive account information such as the 16digit account number with a unique digital identifier called a token the token enables payments to be initiated and communicated to visa without the account holder or acquirer being required to expose personal account numbers pans that could be compromised 

 11 

in fiscal 2018 we expanded vts presence in ten new markets for a total of 40 markets we also enabled more than 20 new global and regional token requestors in fiscal 2018 because of the added security measures token transactions tend to have lower rates of fraud and higher rates of authorization than pans a key value proposition for clients to implement and use tokens this year we also signed several significant merchants and gateways to use or otherwise participate in our token service by expanding access to the visa token service to new partners we expect visa issuers and other partners to offer or enable secure digital payments across an increasing range of solutions and circumstances 

visa checkout  visa checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online and mobile transactions this is particularly important as digital commerce continues to shift from desktop devices to mobile devices where shoppers have higher abandonment rates of their items in their shopping carts at the end of fiscal 2018 visa checkout has over 40 million consumer accounts in 26 countries driven by growth in europe and the united states we also launched visa checkout open platform vcop in fiscal 2017 vcop allows digital wallet partners to integrate with visa checkout thereby providing consumers with improved online and inapplication payment services in doing so consumers have additional options for paying online we plan to start migrating our visa checkout users in select markets to secure remote commerce in mid to late2019 

secure remote commerce  in 2018 we announced our support of the emv secure remote commerce src specifications and the creation of the visa digital commerce program visa dcp our visa dcp platform is an implementation of the emv secure remote commerce technical framework and specifications that enables a merchant to provide a consistent streamlined digital checkout experience to consumers including a common acceptance mark and to obtain secure customer payment information and enhance the security for digital transactions and stored credentials visa dcp includes visa’s src and visa token service platforms visa dcp is planned for launch in the middle of 2019 

contactless 

contactless payments allow consumers to taptopay with a card or near field communication nfc enabled device at a terminal enabled with nfc technology contactless technology offers consumers an additional checkout option while providing the same security as an emv chip card and helps merchants move customers through their checkout lines faster at the end of fiscal 2018 nearly one in four of all facetoface visa domestic transactions running over our global network were contactless up from 15 at the end of fiscal 2017 in many parts of the globe including most of europe canada and parts of asia contactless is mature and accounts for more than half of all facetoface transactions 

additionally contactless payments could provide new payment opportunities in areas such as transit transport for london has now seen over 17 billion contactless journeys and translink in vancouver and milan metro launched in the summer of 2018 additionally many other transit agencies globally have announced plans to launch contactless payments eg new york metropolitan transportation authority singapore land transport authority and metro rio in 2018 we focused on growing contactless card issuance and enabling contactless acceptance in underpenetrated markets such as the united states 

merchant  products 

we have a suite of products and services to help merchants reduce their payment fraud and improve customer loyalty visa commerce network and cybersource’s product offerings are examples of visa’s continued investment to deliver industryleading products and capabilities to our merchant partners 

visa commerce network uses our global payments network to enable merchants to promote relevant offers to acquire new customers drive loyalty and increase sales for example uber and visa commerce network have partnered to introduce visa local offers a cardlinked offer program that rewards enrolled us visa account holders for shopping at thousands of featured merchants in the united states uber credits are awarded to the riders’ uber accounts on qualifying purchases – eliminating the need for coupons or promo codes 

 12 

the cybersource platform enables merchants to accept payments online inapp or on the mobile web and inperson cybersource’s small business solutions are represented by the authorizenet brand in north america cybersource provides modular digital capabilities far beyond the traditional gateway function of connecting merchants to payment processing using cybersource services merchants of all sizes can improve the way their consumers engage and transact mitigate fraud and security risk lower operational costs and adapt to changing business requirements cybersource’s global footprint lets merchants accept payments in over 200 countries and territories across the world and includes a broad choice of acquirer and processor partners payment types and hardware components merchants connect to cybersource directly through apis or via prebuilt integrations to various ecommerce and pointofsale platforms similarly cybersource offers the same technology platform to support acquirers as well as comprehensive payment management solutions and support to attract retain and grow their merchant base 

risk products  payment security initiatives 

we continue to develop our suite of risk products and solutions to help financial institution and merchant clients minimize risk and enable secure commerce 3d secure technology is a fraud detection protocol which provides a data connection between digital merchants payment networks and financial institutions to be able to analyze and share more intelligence information about transactions to boost security and improve the checkout and user experience the 3d secure standard has been updated and will modernize online security fully embracing the benefit of alwayson connectivity across multiple devices the new standard will enable ten times more data to be exchanged between financial institutions and merchants allowing our clients to have greater accuracy in identifying both legitimate and fraudulent transactions 

we are also advancing the adoption of biometric authentication as a more secure alternative to passwords which can be guessed or stolen to help financial institutions and merchants more quickly adopt emerging biometric authentication solutions we launched visa id intelligence a platform that provides a curated selection of leading thirdparty authentication technologies our clients can create test and adopt new authentication solutions with simple integrations using visa apis and software developer’s kits 

financial data security breaches continue to drive financial institution and merchant losses and can undermine consumer confidence in digital payments we are investing in more proactive malware and threat identification to help stop fraud and data loss before it occurs through our ecommerce threat disruption etd capability we can trace malicious servers and identify compromised merchant websites where skimmer code may have been injected we have already successfully disrupted criminal servers driving ecommerce merchant compromises we also conduct testing to identify possible future threats in the context of known vulnerabilities and provide clients with actionable threat intelligence 

we are also providing more robust datadriven insights that help our clients improve their fraud and authorization performance visa’s data analytics capabilities and interactive delivery platforms enable our clients to assess their performance relative to peers and test alternate fraud procedures to model possible improvements 

in addition to our new initiatives we continue to improve existing products and services such as visa risk manager visa advanced authorization visa mobile location confirmation visa consumer controls and visa transaction advisor which provide data driven tools to issuers acquirers and merchants to detect and prevent fraud and improve account holder and transaction authentication as well as providing account holders the ability to track and manage their payment activity on enrolled accounts 

beyond our risk products and solutions we continue to work with the payment card industry security standards council emvco and other industry standards organizations to develop and support standards for payment data security emv chip payment technology emv payment tokenization emv src and emv 3d secure we also partner with financial institutions merchants governments and law enforcement agencies to help identify fraud and share information about security best practices threat intelligence and legal and regulatory developments

competition 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change existing and emerging competitors compete with visa’s network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce mobile payments blockchain technology and digital currencies these advances are enabling new entrants many of which depart from traditional network payment models in certain countries the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete creating local networks or enabling additional processing competition 

we compete against all forms of payment this includes paperbased payments primarily cash and checks and all forms of electronic payments our electronic payment competitors principally include 

global or multiregional networks which typically offer a range of branded general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world examples include mastercard american express discover jcb and unionpay these competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the united states or have a leading position in certain countries for example unionpay operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china and is expanding into other global markets see item 1a—risk factors—regulatory risks—governmentimposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia  based on available data visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world the following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2017 1  

 

local and regional networks that operate   in many countries often with the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial institutions these networks typically focus on debit payment products and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the united states interac in canada eftpos in australia and mir in russia 

 15 

alternate payment providers which often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels but are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale these companies may process payments using inhouse account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the automated clearing house ach global or local networks like visa or some combination of the foregoing in some cases these entities are both a partner and a competitor to visa examples of alternate payment providers include paypal alipay and wechat alipay and wechat pay are among the fastest growing mobile payment providers in the world and pose a competitive challenge to visa and other international networks outside of china 

other electronic payments networks like   the ach in the united states are often regulated by local governments historically focused on interbank transfers many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments mastercard acquired vocalink holdings limited in 2016 which provides faster payments and alternative payments technology that competes with our visa direct offering among other things we also compete with closedloop payment systems emerging payments networks wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers 

payment processors which we compete with for the processing of visa transactions or which may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other networks processors and other thirdparties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance security convenience speed and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions merchants governments nongovernmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2018  or fiscal 2017  accounted for more than 30 of our operating revenues in those years 

working capital 

payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

government regulation 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used the most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below for further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business see item 1a — risk factors — regulatory risks 

anticorruption antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also subject to antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac in the united states therefore we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive ofac trade sanctions currently cuba iran north korea syria and crimea or that are included on ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons to issue or acquire visa cards or engage in transactions using our services 

governmentimposed market participation and restrictions  certain governments including china india indonesia russia thailand and vietnam have taken actions to advantage domestic payments systems andor certain issuers payments networks or processors including by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers impose local ownership requirements on processors require data localization or mandate domestic processing be done in that country 

 16 

interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer act doddfrank act in the united states limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions the european union’s eu ifr limits interchange rates in europe as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia and the central bank of brazil regulate average permissible levels of interchange 

internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol 

network exclusivity and routing  in the united states the doddfrank act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr’s prohibition on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card 

nosurcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation 

privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations which could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data handling practices in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data security breach and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost the changing privacy laws in the united states eg california consumer privacy act europe brazil and elsewhere including the adoption by the european union of the general data protection regulation gdpr effective in may 2018 create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data 

supervisory oversight of the payments industry  visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the united states for example the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to us financial institutions the federal banking agencies comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration visa also may be separately examined by the bureau of consumer financial protection as a service provider to the banks that issue visabranded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countries including russia ukraine and the united kingdom as discussed below have recognized or designated visa as a retail payment system under various types of financial stability regulations visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil and hong kong 

european regulations and supervisory oversight visa europe continues to be subject to complex and evolving regulation in the european economic area visa europe has been designated as a recognized payment system in the united kingdom bringing it within the scope of the bank of england’s supervisory powers and subject to various requirements including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the united kingdom’s financial system visa europe is also subject to the european central bank’s oversight whose main focus is on the functioning of card payments as well as the security operational reliability and business continuity of the schemes and their payment instruments furthermore visa europe is regulated by the united kingdom’s payment systems regulator psr which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices systems rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the united kingdom and ensuring payments meet account holder needs the psr is also the regulator responsible for monitoring visa europe’s compliance with the ifr in the united kingdom the ifr regulates interchange rates within europe requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decisionmaking purposes within the european union and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing national competent authorities in the eu are responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in their markets 

 17 

there are other regulations in the european union that impact our business as discussed above including privacy and data protection antibribery antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions other recent regulatory changes in europe such as the second payment services directive psd2 require among other things that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging nonfinancial institution players psd2 also includes strong customer authentication requirements for certain transactions that could impose both operational complexity on visa and negatively impact consumer payment experiences 

as discussed in item 1a — risk factors — business risks — the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results brexit could lead to further legal and regulatory complexity in europe 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues including mobile payment transactions tokenization access rights for nonfinancial institutions money transfer identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us furthermore following the passage of psd2 in europe several countries including australia canada hong kong and mexico are contemplating granting various types of access rights to third party processors including access to consumer account data maintained by our financial institution clients which could have implications for our business as well 

additional information 

visa inc was incorporated in delaware in may 2007 and we completed our initial public offering in march 2008 prior to 2007 when visa was reorganized visa served its member financial institutions through visa international and regional memberowned associations eg visa usa inc visa canada corporation as part of the 2007 reorganization these associations became a part of visa inc in october 2007 with the exception of visa europe limited which continued to operate as an association until our acquisition in june 2016

 item 1a risk factors   

regulatory risks 

we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results  

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations see item 1 — business — government regulation  for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulations on us our clients and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules affect our existing contractual arrangements increase our compliance costs require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties including competitors in an undesirable manner and reduce our revenue opportunities as discussed in more detail below we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion pointofsale transaction rules and practices privacy data use or protection and associated product technology as a result the visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities 

 18 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services fees and other important aspects of our business in the various regions where we operate our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws such as antimoney laundering anticorruption competition privacy and sanctions and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve however we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal penalties litigation investigations and proceedings and damage to our global brands and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa products our clients issue the volume of payments we process our revenues our brands our competitive positioning our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services the quality and types of products and services we offer the countries in which our products are used and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products all of which could harm our business 

increased regulation of the global payments industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees operating rules risk management protocols and other related practices could harm our business  

regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see  item 1 business —government regulation for more information   in the united states and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction in the context of credit and debit transactions those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers the reverse is true for certain transactions like atm interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 

interchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example regulations adopted by the us federal reserve cap the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent the doddfrank act also limits issuers’ and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacts our business the eu’s ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and crossborder transactions within europe 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively eu member states have the ability to further reduce these interchange levels within their territories more recently countries in latin america have also adopted interchange caps for example in march 2017 argentina’s central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions in march 2018 brazil adopted interchange caps on debit transactions 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors’ closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees or reducing certain benefits to consumers which make our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us including reductions in the fees that we charge which may directly impact our revenues 

in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business for example governments such as in india may use regulation to further drive down merchant discount rates which could negatively affect the economics of our transactions similarly the payment system regulator’s review of the acquiring market in the united kingdom could lead to additional regulatory pressure on our business with increased merchant lobbying we could also begin to see regulatory interest in network fees government regulations or pressure may also require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services or to have the other network’s functionality or brand marks on our products as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence in addition the european union’s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and impacts the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies 

 19 

we are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets including brazil russia the united kingdom and within the european union this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally as well as localized risk management or governance increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system including allowing nontraditional financial technology companies to act as issuers or acquirers additionally regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles 

as we develop new product and service offerings to support our clients the potential scope of regulatory obligations and scrutiny could also increase for instance new products and capabilities including tokenization and mobile and push payments could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered 

finally regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 

governmentimposed restrictions on international payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china india and russia  

governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks brands and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations to varying degrees these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks in the future public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments processing be performed entirely within that country which would prevent us from managing the endtoend processing of certain transactions 

in russia legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions the central bank controlled national payment card system nspk is the only entity allowed to process domestically in china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the people’s bank of china pboc to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural steps remain uncertain the approval process might require several years and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks 

recent regulatory initiatives in india also suggest growing nationalistic priorities including a recent data localization mandate passed by the government which has cost implications for us and could affect our ability to effectively compete with domestic payment providers furthermore regional groups of countries such as the gulf cooperation countries in the middle east and a number of countries in southeast asia are considering or may consider efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions the african development bank has also indicated an interest in supporting national payment systems in its efforts to expand financial inclusion and strengthen regional financial stability geopolitical events including sanctions trade tensions or other types of activities could potentially intensify this activity which could adversely affect our business 

due to our inability to manage the endtoend processing of transactions for cards in certain countries eg russia and thailand we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or thirdparty processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or onshore processing 

 20 

cobadging and coresidency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national networks for issuance and routing for example in china certain banks have issued dualbranded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks the pboc is contemplating that dualbranded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china’s domestic payments market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visaonly branded cards for international travel and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license however notwithstanding such efforts the phase out of dualbranded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in china 

mir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china respectively and are actively pursuing international expansion plans which could potentially lead to regulatory pressures on our international routing rule which requires that international transactions on visa cards be routed over visanet furthermore although regulatory barriers shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china respectively alternate payment providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce offline and crossborder payments which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china last year with strong backing from china’s government a new digital transaction routing system known as netlink was established the pboc allowed alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in netlink it and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with other international payments networks  

in general national laws that protect domestic providers or processing may increase our costs decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products services and innovations force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets and create new competitors all of which could harm our business 

laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us  

our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for example the gdpr extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the company’s location the law requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data although we have an extensive data privacy program that addresses the gdpr requirements our ongoing efforts to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws such as the new california consumer privacy act effective as of january 2020 and the brazilian general data protection law effective as of february 2020 may entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer in addition earlier this year india adopted a data localization law that requires all payment system operators to store domestic transaction data only in india such data localization requirements have cost implications for us impact our ability to utilize the efficiencies and value of our global network and could affect our strategy furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

 21 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in tax laws  

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service the uk’s hm revenue  customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as future regulatory guidance on the us tax cuts and jobs act tax law changes in the united states or foreign jurisdictions or those resulting from the base erosion and profit shifting project being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development may also materially affect our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 16—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

litigation risks 

we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place  

we are involved in numerous litigation matters investigations and proceedings asserted by civil litigants governments and enforcement bodies alleging among other things violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law and intellectual property law these are referred to as “actions” in this section details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 17—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report these actions are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable in any material action particularly in a large class action lawsuit such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or we incur liability arising from a government investigation we may be required to pay significant awards settlements or fines in addition settlement terms judgments or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify among other things the default interchange reimbursement rates we set the visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules our fees or pricing or the way we do business the outcome of these actions may also influence regulators investigators governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions which may lead to additional actions against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them even if visa is not a defendant 

for certain actions like those that are us covered litigation or ve territory covered litigation as described in note 2—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 17—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

business risks 

we face intense competition in our industry  

the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors or methods of payment emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multiregional networks other domestic and closedloop payments systems and alternate payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients emerging payment providers and other digital and technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels 

 22 

our competitors may develop substantially better technology have more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer more effective innovative or a wider range of programs products and services they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions which could hurt our financial results and prospects 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternate payments systems like alipay and wechat pay operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the doddfrank act or the us federal reserve’s faster payments initiatives may provide them with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments alternate payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example 

 

 

 

 

 



 23 

as the competitive landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses products services and practices we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth 

our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain  

our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue nonvisa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients in order to stay competitive we may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments adapt to regulatory changes and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include upfront cash payments fee discounts rebates credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options market pressures on pricing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset or absorb the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits 

in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or cobrand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 

merchants’ and processors’ continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business  

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa products certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions such as the united states canada and europe to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory enforcement filing lawsuits and in some cases refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products for example in the united states certain stakeholders have raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact the cost of payment card acceptance in addition to ongoing litigation related to the us migration to emvcapable cards and pointofsale terminals us merchantaffiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process and some policymakers have concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council in the development of payment card standards additionally some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transactions to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers’ usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement andor litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business 

 24 

we depend on relationships with financial institutions acquirers processors merchants and other third parties  

as noted above our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for instance we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace we engage in discussions with merchants acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we also engage in many payment card cobranding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships in addition we depend on our clients and third parties including vendors and suppliers to process transactions properly provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and otherwise adhere to our operating rules to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their visabranded payment products which could harm our business and reputation 

our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation or if we experience brand disintermediation  

our brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business we believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions may have the potential to cause consumer confusion or brand disintermediation at the pointofsale and decrease the value of our brand our brand reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including clearing and settlement service disruptions data security breaches compliance failures by visa including our employees agents clients partners or suppliers negative perception of our industry the industries of our clients or visaaccepting merchants illperceived actions by clients or other third parties such as sponsorship or cobrand partners and fraudulent risky controversial or illegal activities using our payment products if we are unable to maintain our reputation the value of our brand may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients account holders and the public as well as impact our business 

global economic political market and social events or conditions may harm our business  

our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in addition more than half of our operating revenues are earned outside the united states international crossborder transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy therefore adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics or other local or global health issues political uncertainties international hostilities armed conflict or unrest and natural disasters could impact our operations our clients our activities in a particular location and crossborder travel and spend geopolitical trends towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions could limit the expansion of our business in those regions the current trade environment reduces the likelihood of having our bank card clearing institution application in china approved in addition any decline in crossborder travel and spend could impact the number of crossborder transactions we process and our currency exchange activities which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues 

a decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions could reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which ultimately impact our revenues they may also implement costreduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced valueadded services from us 

 25 

any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if clients default on their settlement obligations it may also impact our liquidity any of these events could adversely affect the growth of our volumes and revenue 

our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity  

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa operating rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 8—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results  

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government initiated the exit process under article 50 of the treaty of the european union commencing a period of up to two years for the united kingdom and the other eu member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal uncertainty over the terms of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the united kingdom and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results 

brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and european union we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the european union and as a result our visa operating rules and contractual commitments in the united kingdom and the rest of the european union may be impacted in addition we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member states following brexit these factors may impact our ability to operate and process data in the european union and united kingdom seamlessly this and other brexitrelated issues may require changes to our legal entity structure in the united kingdom and the european union any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

failure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth  

the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity payment technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrencies and new authentication technologies such as biometrics distributed ledger and blockchain technologies as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated moreover some of the new technologies could be subject to intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or claims potentially impacting our development efforts andor requiring us to obtain licenses if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients impact our intellectual property or licensing rights harm our business and impact our future growth 

 26 

a disruption failure or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our business  

our cybersecurity and processing systems as well as those of financial institutions merchants and thirdparty service providers may experience errors interruptions delays or damage from a number of causes including power outages hardware software and network failures computer viruses malware or other destructive software internal design manual or usage errors cyberattacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters and severe weather conditions for instance on june 1 2018 our european authorization systems suffered a partial service disruption that prevented many cardholders from using visa’s european systems for payments for several hours that day although that service disruption was caused by a switch malfunction rather than a cyberattack and was limited to the european authorization system which has since been decommissioned with the processing migration to our global platform the fact remains that our systems are highly technical and complex and are not immune from errors and vulnerabilities 

furthermore our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put our company at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts we may also be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions merchants or thirdparty processors we are aware of instances where nation states have sponsored attacks against some of our financial institution clients and other instances where merchants have encountered substantial data security breaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders although these attacks and breaches have not had a direct material impact on us we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business 

numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes particularly on our internet applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely the security measures and procedures we our financial institution and merchant clients other merchants and thirdparty service providers in the payments ecosystem have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches cyberattacks or system failures in some cases the mitigation efforts may be dependent on third parties who may not deliver to the required contractual standards or whose hardware software or network services may be subject to error defect delay or outage although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats 

these events could significantly disrupt our operations impact our clients and consumers damage our reputation and brand result in litigation violations of applicable privacy and other laws and regulatory scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties result in damages or changes to our business practices decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products decrease our volume revenues and future growth prospects and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise 

structural and organizational risks 

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments and may face risks and uncertainties as a result  

as part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisitions and strategic investments we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments and they may involve significant risks and uncertainties including 



 27 

 we may be unable to attract hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce including key management  

the talents and efforts of our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market ongoing changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations have made it more difficult for employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which we have operations and could continue to impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters integrity innovation and collaboration could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success 

the conversions of our class b and class c common stock or series b and series c preferred stock into shares of class a common stock would result in voting dilution to and could impact the market price of our existing class a common stock  

the market price of our class a common stock could fall as a result of many factors under our us retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our us covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock our series b and series c preferred stock will become convertible into class a common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims conversion of our class b and class c common stock into class a common stock or our series b and series c preferred stock into class a common stock would increase the amount of class a common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class a common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class a common stockholders 

holders of our class b and c common stock and series b and series c preferred stock may have different interests than our class a common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions  

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock and in certain specified circumstances holders of our series b and series c preferred stock can vote on certain significant transactions with respect to our class b and c common stock these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series b and series c preferred stock voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series b and series c preferred stock would either i receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or ii receive securities cash or other property that is different from what our class a common stockholders would receive because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class a common stock are our current and former financial institution clients they may have interests that diverge from our class a common stockholders as a result the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class a common stockholders 

 28 

delaware law provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could make a merger takeover attempt or change in control difficult  

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable for example except for limited exceptions

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers merchants financial institutions businesses strategic partners and government entities our advanced transaction processing network visanet enables authorization clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products platforms and valueadded services 

us tax reform legislation  on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act transitions the us tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date and the remeasurement resulted in a onetime noncash tax benefit of 11 billion and was recorded in the year ended september 30 2018  in transitioning to the new territorial system the tax act requires us to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income this tax referred to as the “transition tax” was estimated to be 11 billion and was recorded in the year ended september 30 2018  see note 16—income taxes   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  

financial overview our financial results for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  include the impact of several significant onetime items our asreported us gaap and adjusted nongaap net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below 



 highlights for fiscal 2018  our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal 2018  reflects solid global consumer spending growth supported by favorable us economic conditions and tempered by volatility in some emerging markets we recorded net operating revenues of 206 billion  for fiscal 2018  an increase of 12  over the prior year primarily reflecting continued growth in processed transactions nominal payments volume and nominal crossborder volume the effect of exchange rate movements as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in an approximately one percentage point positive  impact to our net operating revenue growth 

total operating expenses for fiscal 2018  were 77 billion  compared to 62 billion  in fiscal 2017  the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by a higher litigation provision and continued investments to support our business growth 

 33 

adjusted financial results our financial results for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years as they were either nonrecurring or had no cash impact as such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 



 34 

 adjusted operating expenses operating margin nonoperating income expense income tax provision net income and diluted earnings per share are nongaap financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with us gaap the following tables reconcile our asreported financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap to the respective nongaap adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016

nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues nominal payments volume over the prior year posted low doubledigit growth in the united states driven mainly by consumer credit and debit nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar and the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments on a constantdollar basis which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements our international payments volume growth rate was 11  for the 12 months ended june 30 2018 growth on a constantdollar basis was not significantly different from the nominaldollar basis growth rate for the 12 months ended june 30 2017 1  growth in processed transactions for fiscal 2017 reflects the inclusion of visa europe’s processed transactions for the full year compared to three months in fiscal 2016

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses 



 

total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the 600 million accrual related to the us covered litigation and our ongoing investments to support our business growth see note 2—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 17—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report for more information on the us covered litigation accrual total operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the 19 billion loss related to the effective settlement of the framework agreement between visa and visa europe recorded during fiscal 2016 the remaining components of total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of visa europe expenses additional factors impacting our operating expenses are discussed below

effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate was 20  in fiscal 2018  and 43  in fiscal 2017  the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 primarily due to 



 42 

the effective income tax rate was 43 in fiscal 2017 and 25 in fiscal 2016 the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to 

 the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 transitions the us tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  the reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21  became effective on january 1 2018 in fiscal 2018 our statutory federal corporate rate is a blended rate of 245  which will be reduced to 21  in fiscal 2019 and thereafter 

as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate we provisionally remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date of the tax act the deferred tax remeasurement is now complete and resulted in a onetime noncash tax benefit of 11 billion recorded in fiscal 2018 

in transitioning to the new territorial tax system the tax act requires that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income such foreign earnings are subject to a onetime tax at 155  on the amount held in cash or cash equivalents and at 8  on the remaining noncash amount the 155  and 8  tax collectively referred to as the “transition tax” was estimated to be 11 billion  and was recorded in fiscal 2018 the transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the tax act 

the abovementioned accounting impact of the transition tax is provisional based on currently available information and technical guidance on the interpretations of the new law we continue to obtain and analyze additional information and guidance as they become available to complete the accounting for the tax impact of the tax act additional information currently unavailable that is needed to complete the analysis includes but is not limited to foreign tax returns and foreign tax documentation for the computation of foreign tax credits and the final determination of the untaxed foreign earnings subject to the transition tax the provisional accounting impact may change until the accounting analysis is finalized which will occur no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as permitted by asu 201805 

adjusted effective income tax rate  our financial results for fiscal 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in prior or future years as they are either nonrecurring or have no cash impact as such we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rates in the tables below which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2018 and 2017 see overview—adjusted financial results  within this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

 44 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 



operating activiti es cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our underlying business fiscal 2017 was impacted by the inclusion of visa europe in our results for the full year while fiscal 2016 had one quarter of results that included visa europe other factors impacting cash provided by operating activities include 

 the cash inflows and outflows related to the us litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan see note 2—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 17—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide we believe that cash flow generated from operations in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

 45 

foreign earnings  pursuant to the tax act we are required to pay us tax on most of the undistributed and untaxed foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries accumulated as of december 31 2017 the transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the tax act as a result of the tax act we are no longer subject to incremental us federal tax on foreign earnings of nonus subsidiaries in the event that we repatriate these earnings back to the united states 

availableforsale investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 34 billion  are classified as current and are available to meet shortterm liquidity needs the remaining noncurrent investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however they are also generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30 2018  see note 6—debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

credit facility we have an unsecured 40 billion  revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires on january 27 2022  there were no borrowings under the credit facility as of september 30 2018  and we were in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended september 30 2018  see note 6—debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

universal shelf registration statement in july 2018 we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions this registration statement expires in july 2021 

us litigation escrow account  pursuant to the terms of the us retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a us litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation will be payable when we fund the us litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock in june 2018 we deposited 600 million into the us litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation see note 2—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 17—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report the balance in this account at september 30 2018  was 15 billion  and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the us covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

longterm debt  in september 2017 we issued fixedrate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 25 billion  with maturities ranging between 5  and 30  years in october 2017 we redeemed all of the 175 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 notes the redemption was funded with the net proceeds from the new fixedrate senior notes issued in september 2017 we are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance see note 6—debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

 46 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2018  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlements in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions in general during fiscal 2018  we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of 931 million we hold approximately 76 billion of available liquidity globally as of september 30 2018  in the form of cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle 

us covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the us covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation are payable from the us litigation escrow account during fiscal 2018  we deposited 600 million into the us litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation and made 150 million covered litigation payments that were funded from the us litigation escrow account at september 30 2018  the us litigation escrow account had an available balance of 15 billion  in september 2018 visa and other defendants entered into a new settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages which superseded and amended the 2012 settlement agreement the proposed settlement amount is approximately 62 billion our share represents approximately 41 billion the majority of which will be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court plus the 600 million we deposited into its litigation escrow account in june 2018 no additional funds are required for this class settlement our share is covered under the us retrospective responsibility plan which was created to insulate visa and our class a common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases until the court approves the 2018 settlement agreement it is uncertain whether the company will be able to resolve the damages class plaintiffs’ claims as contemplated by that agreement if the 2018 settlement agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation escrow account into courtsupervised settlement funds we will have the right to the majority of these funds which would be returned to the us litigation escrow account this will increase our taxable income thereby increasing our taxes to be paid see note 2—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans   and   note 17—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the us covered litigation including ve territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding could give rise to future liquidity needs 

reduction in asconverted shares  during fiscal 2018  share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced asconverted class a common stock by 63 million at an average price of 12438 per share of the 63 million shares 58 million  were repurchased in the open market using 72 billion  of cash on hand additionally we deposited 600 million of operating cash into the us litigation escrow account previously established under the us retrospective responsibility plan the deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class a common stock because it reduces the class b conversion rate and consequently the asconverted class a common stock share count see note 2—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 11—stockholders’ equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report

in january 2018 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for 75 billion  this authorization has no expiration date as of september 30 2018  we had remaining authorized funds of 42 billion  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to january 2018 have been completed see note 11—stockholders’ equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

dividends  during fiscal 2018  we declared and paid 19 billion  in dividends on october 16 2018  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 025  per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and c common stock and series b and c preferred stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 574 million  in connection with this dividend on december 4 2018  see note 11—stockholders’ equity   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by the board of directors all preferred and class b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the united states as a result of the acquisition of visa europe we assumed the obligations related to visa europe’s defined benefit plan primarily consisting of the uk pension plans our policy with respect to our us qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in september of each year an amount not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our us nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis in relation to the visa europe uk pension plans our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed with the uk pension plan trustees in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 we made contributions to our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans of 3 million  12 million and 4 million respectively for visa europe’s uk pension plans we made contributions of 11 million  5 million and 102 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans in fiscal 2019  given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans and visa europe’s uk defined benefit pension plans by approximately 3 million  and 10 million  respectively the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences see note 7—pension postretirement and other benefits  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

capital expenditures  our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018  due to investments in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives 

acquisitions in february 2017 we acquired a business using 302 million of cash on hand primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received the acquisition will help visa’s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce on june 21 2016 we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe in connection with the purchase we will pay an additional €10 billion plus 4 compound annual interest on the third anniversary of the closing of the visa europe acquisition see note 5—intangible assets and goodwill  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2018  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 150 billion  of assets and 22 million  of liabilities none of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs see note 3—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below 

 48 

indemnifications 

we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see   note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 8—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2018 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume increasing visa product acceptance winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language eg early termination clauses management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using clientreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients merchants and business partners 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2018  client incentives represented 21  of gross operating revenues 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plan’s mechanisms include the use of the us litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the us litigation escrow account 

 50 

balance we recorded an additional accrual of 600 million  for us covered litigation during fiscal 2018 our europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liabilities and losses relating to the covered period subject to certain limitations and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the european commission proceedings or any other matter see note 2—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 17—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 17—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated nonfunctional currency denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 37 billion  and 31 billion  at september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2018  is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10  increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately 280 million  or loss of approximately 350 million  respectively on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2018  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 9—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

on june 21 2016 we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe on the third anniversary of the closing of the visa europe transaction we will pay an additional purchase consideration of €10 billion  plus 40  compounded annual interest as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the us dollar against the euro a hypothetical 10  decline in the us dollar against the euro compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2018  would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by 130 million  including interest 

 51 

we are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of visa europe is the euro translation from the euro to the us dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10  change in the euro against the us dollar compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2018  would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 20 billion  we designate a portion of our eurodenominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of 188 billion  in visa europe as of september 30 2018  changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period partially offset the foreign currency translation of the company’s net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the company’s consolidated balance sheets see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  and note 9—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our operating results or cash flows have been nor are they expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2018  and 2017  were 51 billion  and 64 billion  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately 31 million  on our investment securities at september 30 2018  the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 35 billion  and 18 billion  at september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2018  and 2017  our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 11 billion  at each year end and projected benefit obligations were 08 billion  and 09 billion  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10  decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1  decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 206 million  in the funded status and an increase of approximately 35 million  in pension cost 

at september 30 2018  and 2017  our nonus defined benefit pension plan assets were 04 billion  at each year end and projected benefit obligations were 05 billion  and 04 billion  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10  decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1  decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 148 million  in the funded status and an increase of approximately 13 million  in pension cost 

we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2019  if any which would be made in september 2019

competition 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change existing and emerging competitors compete with visas network and payment solutions for consumers and for participation by financial institutions and merchants technology and innovation are shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce mobile payments block chain technology and digital currencies these advances are enabling new entrants many of which depart from traditional network payment models in certain countries the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete creating local networks or enabling processing competition 

we compete against all forms of payment this includes paperbased payments primarily cash and checks and all forms of electronic payments our electronic payment competitors principally include 

global or multiregional networks which typically offer a range of branded general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world examples include mastercard american express discover jcb and unionpay these competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the united states or have a leading position in certain countries for example unionpay operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china and is expanding into other global markets see item 1a—risk factors—regulatory risks—governmentimposed restrictions on payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china and russia  based on available data visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world the following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2016 1  

 

local and regional networks that operate   in many countries often with the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial institutions these networks typically focus on debit payment products have functionality or their brand marks present with the visa brand on the card or payment device and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the united states interac in canada eftpos in australia and mir in russia 

alternate payment providers which often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels but which are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale these companies may process payments using inhouse account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the automated clearing house ach or global or local networks like visa in some cases these entities are both a partner and a competitor to visa examples of alternate payment providers include paypal alipay and wechat alipay and wechat pay are among the fastest growing mobile payment providers in the world and may pose a competitive challenge to visa and other international networks outside of china 

 15 

other electronic payments networks like   the ach in the united states are often regulated by local governments historically focused on interbank transfers many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments mastercard acquired vocalink holdings limited in 2016 which provides faster payments technology that competes with our visa direct offering we also compete with closedloop payment systems emerging payments networks like zelle wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers 

payment processors which we compete with for the processing of visa transactions or which may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the interchange fee regulation ifr we may face competition from other networks processors and other thirdparties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients we believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance security convenience speed and reliability offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions merchants governments nongovernmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2017  or fiscal 2016  accounted for more than 30 of our operating revenues in those years 

working capital 

payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

financial information about geographic areas 

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see note 12—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

government regulation 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used the most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below for further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business see item 1a — risk factors — regulatory risks 

supervisory oversight of the payments industry  visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the united states for example the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies as a technology service provider to us financial institutions the federal banking agencies comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union administration and the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb visa also may be separately examined by the cfpb as a service provider to the banks that issue visabranded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countries including russia ukraine hong kong and the united kingdom as discussed below have recognized or designated visa for purposes of various degrees of financial stability regulation as a retail payment system visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil mexico uruguay and colombia 

governmentimposed market participation and restrictions  certain governments including china russia indonesia and india have taken actions to advantage domestic payments systems andor certain issuers payments networks or processors including by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers impose local ownership requirements on processors or mandate domestic processing be done entirely in that country 

 16 

interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer act doddfrank act in the united states limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions the european unions eu ifr limits interchange rates in europe as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia regulates average permissible levels of interchange 

network exclusivity and routing  in the united states the doddfrank act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing arrangements for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr’s prohibition on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card 

nosurcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation 

privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations which could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity and data handling practices in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost the changing privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the adoption by the european union of the general data protection regulation which will become effective in may 2018 create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data 

anticorruption antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also subject to antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac in the united states therefore we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive ofac trade sanctions currently cuba iran north korea syria and crimea or that are included on ofacs list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons to issue or acquire visabranded cards or engage in transactions using our services 

internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues including mobile payment transactions tokenization access rights for nonfinancial institutions money transfer identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us 

european regulations and supervisory oversight in addition following the visa europe acquisition in june 2016 we are subject to complex and evolving regulation of our business in the european economic area visa europe has been designated as a recognized payment system in the united kingdom bringing it within the scope of the bank of england’s oversight and subject to various requirements including on issues such as governance and risk management designed to maintain the stability of the uk financial system visa europe is also subject to the eurosystem’s oversight whose main focus is on the functioning of card payments as well as the security operational reliability and business continuity of the schemes and their payment instruments furthermore visa europe is regulated by the united kingdom’s payment systems regulator psr which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices systems rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the united kingdom and ensuring payments meet account holder needs it also is the regulator responsible for monitoring visa europes compliance with the ifr in the united kingdom the ifr regulates interchange rates within europe requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decision making purposes within the european union and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing national competent authorities in other eu markets and the european 

 17 

central bank itself have the ability not only to monitor visas compliance with the ifr but also to impose their own oversight regimes 

there are other regulations in the european union that impact our business as discussed above including privacy and data protection antibribery antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions other recent regulatory changes in europe such as the psd2 require among other things that our financial institution clients provide certain customer account access rights to emerging nonfinancial institution players

 item 1a risk factors   

regulatory risks 

increased regulation of the global payments industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees operating rules and related practices could harm our business  

regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see  item 1 business —government regulation for more information   in the united states and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 

interchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example the us federal reserve caps the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent the doddfrank act also limits issuers and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacts our business the eu’s ifr places an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and crossborder transactions within europe 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively eu member states have the ability to further restrict these interchange levels within their territories more recently in march 2017 argentinas central bank passed regulations that cap interchange fees on credit and debit transactions 

in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business for example government regulations or pressure may require us to allow other payments networks to support visa products or services or to have the other networks functionality or brand marks on our products as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence in addition the european union’s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and continues to impact the efficient integration of visa europe the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies our ability to provide effective account holder services the amount of data available for use in fraud and risk systems and loyalty services 

 18 

we are also subject to central bank oversight in some markets including the united kingdom and within the european union this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally as well as localized risk management or governance increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system including allowing nontraditional financial technology companies to act as issuers or acquirers additionally regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles 

regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to similar regulation as debit payments additionally regulation in an individual country could expand for example the reserve bank of australia initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees or reducing certain benefits to consumers which make our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their payment programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us including reductions in the fees that we charge which may directly impact our revenues for these reasons increased global regulation of the payments industry may make our products less desirable diminish our ability to compete reduce our transaction volumes and harm our business 

governmentimposed restrictions on payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries including significant markets such as china and russia  

governments in a number of jurisdictions shield domestic payment card networks brands and processors from international competition by imposing market access barriers and preferential domestic regulations to varying degrees these policies and regulations affect the terms of competition in the marketplace and undermine the competitiveness of international payments networks in the future public authorities may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or mandate that domestic payments processing be performed entirely within that country which would prevent us from managing the endtoend processing of certain transactions 

in russia legislation effectively prevents us from processing domestic transactions the central bank controlled national payment card system nspk is the only entity allowed to process domestically in china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark although we have filed an application with the peoples bank of china pboc to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the timing and the procedural steps remain uncertain the approval process might require several years and there is no guarantee that the license to operate a bcci will be approved or if we obtain such license that we will be able to successfully compete with domestic payments networks furthermore due to our inability to manage the endtoend processing of transactions for cards in certain countries we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or thirdparty processors to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively our ability to do so may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and policies pertaining to transaction routing or onshore processing 

cobadging and coresidency regulations may pose additional challenges in markets where visa competes with national schemes for issuance and routing for example in china certain banks have issued dualbranded cards for which domestic transactions in china are processed by unionpay and transactions outside of china are processed by us or other international payments networks the pboc is contemplating that dualbranded cards could be phased out over time as new licenses are issued to international companies to participate in china’s domestic payments market accordingly we have been working with chinese issuers to issue visaonly branded cards for international travel and later for domestic transactions after we obtain a bcci license however notwithstanding such efforts the phase out of dualbranded cards may decrease our payment volumes and impact the revenue we generate in china 

 19 

mir and unionpay have grown rapidly in russia and china respectively and are actively pursuing international expansion plans although regulatory barriers shield mir and unionpay from competition in russia and china respectively alternate payment providers such as alipay and wechat pay have rapidly expanded into ecommerce offline and crossborder payments which could make it difficult for us to compete even if our license is approved in china earlier this year with strong backing from china’s government a new digital transaction routing system known as netlink was established the pboc allowed alipay and other digital payment providers to invest in netlink it and other such systems could have a competitive advantage in comparison with other international payments networks  

in general national laws that protect domestic processing may increase our costs decrease our payments volumes and impact the revenue we generate in those countries decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and controlling the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities limit our growth and the ability to introduce new products services and innovations force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets and create new competitors all of which could harm our business 

we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results  

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations see item 1 — business — government regulation  for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulations on us our clients and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules affect our existing contractual arrangements increase our compliance costs require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties including competitors in an undesirable manner and reduce our revenue opportunities we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion pointofsale transaction rules and practices privacy data use or protection and associated product technology as a result the visa rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services fees and other important aspects of our business in the various regions where we operate our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws such as antimoney laundering sanctions and anticorruption and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve however we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal penalties litigation investigations and proceedings and damage to our global brands and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of visa products our clients issue the volume of payments we process our revenues our brands our competitive positioning our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services the quality and types of products and services we offer the countries in which our products are used and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products all of which could harm our business 

laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us  

our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for example the gdpr which becomes effective in may 2018 extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the company’s location the law requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including new rights such as the “portability” of personal data although we have an extensive program underway to address gdpr requirements our efforts to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws may entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

 20 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in tax laws  

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service the uk’s hm revenue  customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform or those resulting from the base erosion and profit shifting project being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 18—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

litigation risks 

we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place  

we are involved in numerous litigation matters investigations and proceedings asserted by civil litigants governments and enforcement bodies alleging violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law and intellectual property law among others these are referred to as actions in this section details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in note 19—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report these actions are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable in any material action particularly in a large class action lawsuit or an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or arising from a government investigation we may be required to pay significant awards settlements or fines in addition settlement terms judgments or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by requiring us to modify the default interchange reimbursement rates we set revise the visa rules or the way in which we enforce our rules modify our fees or pricing or modify the way we do business the outcome of these actions may also influence regulators investigators governments or civil litigants in the same or other jurisdictions which may lead to the assertion of additional actions against visa finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation asserted against them even if visa is not a defendant 

for certain actions like the us covered litigation and the ve territory covered litigation which are described in note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 19—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report we have certain protections as provided in the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are able to either fund settlements or judgments in the case of the us covered litigation or recoup covered losses in the case of the ve territory covered litigation the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

business risks 

we face intense competition in our industry  

the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multiregional networks other closedloop payments systems and alternate payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients emerging payment providers and other digital and technology companies many of these providers have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels and are seeking to expand into other channels that compete with or replace our products and services

additionally some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer more innovative or a wider range of programs products and services they may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements moreover even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us than we currently receive from visanet transactions which could hurt our financial results and prospects 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions 

some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternate payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the doddfrank act or the us federal reserve’s faster payments initiatives may provide them with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and the ifr and in the united kingdom through the psr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments alternate payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing transactions for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example

 our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth 

our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain  

our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue nonvisa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in order to stay competitive we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include upfront cash payments fee discounts rebates credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options market pressures on providing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits 

in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or cobrand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 

merchants and processors continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business  

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa products certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions such as the united states to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory enforcement filing lawsuits and in some cases refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products for example in the united states the cost of payment card acceptance has emerged in the context of payment security a number of merchant trade associations claim that emv cards without pin cardholder verification are not worth the investment the october 2015 liability shift and ongoing transition to emv resulted in calls for a pin verification mandate us merchantaffiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process some policymakers have called upon us competition authorities to consider potential 

 23 

concerns arising from the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council additionally some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transactions to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement andor litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business 

we depend on relationships with our financial institution clients acquirers merchants and other third parties  

we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for example in the united states the emv migration has been resisted by certain merchants leading to conflicts and litigation concerning the timing and scope of the liability shift chargebacks and debit routing among others 

we engage in discussions with merchants acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we engage in many payment card cobranding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships 

in addition we depend on third parties including suppliers and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services our business and reputation could be harmed 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands if events occur that damage our reputation or brands or we experience brand disintermediation it could harm our business  

our brands are globally recognized and are key assets of our business we believe that our clients and account holders associate our brands with acceptance security convenience speed and reliability our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brands and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the increased use or popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with large technology and financial institution companies could result in consumer confusion or brand disintermediation and decrease the value of our brand we may not succeed in addressing consumer confusion and brand disintermediation due to the challenges of evolving digital form factors and ecommerce technologies our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including data security breaches compliance failures negative perception of our industry or the industries of our clients actions by clients or other third parties such as sponsorship partners that do not reflect our views or are inconsistent with our own business practices and fraudulent controversial or illegal activities using our payment products if we are unable to maintain our reputation our reputation is damaged or any threatened or resulting claims arise as a result the value of our brands may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients account holders and the public as well as impact our business 

global economic political market and social events or conditions may harm our business  

our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in addition almost half of our operating revenues are earned outside the united states international transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy therefore adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics or other local or global health issues political uncertainties international hostilities armed conflict or unrest and natural disasters could impact our operations our clients our activities in a particular location and crossborder travel and spend geopolitical trends towards nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions could also reduce crossborder travel and spend any such decline in crossborder activity could impact the number of crossborder transactions we process and our currency exchange activities which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues 

 24 

a decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions to reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which ultimately impact our revenues they may also implement costreduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced valueadded services from us 

any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if clients default on their settlement obligations it may also impact our liquidity any of these events could adversely affect the growth of our volumes and revenue 

our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity  

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the timing difference between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time and any subsequent amounts that may fall due relating to adjustments for previously processed transactions concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 10—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results  

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to as brexit in march 2017 the uk government initiated the exit process under article 50 of the treaty of the european union commencing a period of up to two years for the united kingdom and the other eu member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal uncertainty over the terms of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union could cause political and economic uncertainty in the united kingdom and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results 

brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and european union we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the united kingdom may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the european union and as a result our visa rules and contractual commitments in the united kingdom may be impacted in addition because we conduct business in and have operations in the united kingdom we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member states these factors may impact our ability to operate in the european union and united kingdom seamlessly any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

failure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact our future growth  

the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrencies new authentication technologies including biometrics distributed ledger and blockchain technologies and as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including some potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how these technologies may be regulated moreover some of these new technologies could be subject to intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or assertions potentially impacting our development efforts andor requiring us to obtain licenses if we or our partners fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in the payments 

 25 

space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients impact our intellectual property or licensing rights and harm our business and impact our future growth 

a failure in or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our business  

our cybersecurity and processing systems as well as those of financial institutions merchants and thirdparty service providers may experience damage or disruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunication failures computer viruses malware or other destructive software internal design manual or usage errors cyberattacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters and severe weather conditions our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put us at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts we may also be impacted by breaches of our financial institution clients merchants or thirdparty processors for instance several merchants have encountered substantial data breaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders although these merchant breaches have not had a direct material impact on us we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attacks to our business 

in addition numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes particularly on our internet applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of data in our systems the security measures and procedures we our clients merchants and thirdparty service providers have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches cyberattacks or system failures although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data and to prevent detect and respond to data security incidents there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats 

because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to disable or degrade systems change frequently have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely as these threats continue to evolve and increase we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities 

if we are sued in connection with any data security breach or system failure we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices any of which could harm our business in addition any reputational damage resulting from a data security breach or system failure at one or more of our clients merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products which could harm our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally a breach or failure may also subject visa to additional regulations or governmental or regulatory investigations which could result in significant compliance costs fines or enforcement actions or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions 

we may experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing systems which could significantly disrupt our operations impact our clients and consumers damage our reputation result in litigation violations of applicable privacy and other laws and regulatory fines or penalties decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise 

structural and organizational risks 

failure to maintain interoperability with visa europes systems during the integration could damage the business and global perception of our brands  

in june 2016 we acquired visa europe while visa europes systems are being integrated with our legacy systems we will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement systems as a result we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories regardless of where the transaction originates visa europes independent system operations could present challenges to our business in 

 26 

the event of increasing costs or difficulties in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems during the integration phase the separation of payment card scheme and processing may also exacerbate this risk any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between visa europe and our legacy operations could negatively affect the experience of consumers using visa products globally moreover we are beginning the process of migrating european activity onto visanets systems in 2018 and successfully integrating our systems is expected to be time consuming costly and technologically challenging failure to authorize clear and settle interterritory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands 

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or strategic investments and may face risks and uncertainties as a result  

as part of our overall business strategy we may make acquisitions and strategic investments for example we believe the acquisition of visa europe positions us to create additional value through increased scale efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses and benefits related to visa europe’s transition from an association to a forprofit enterprise although there can be no guarantee that we will realize these benefits our current and future acquisitions and strategic investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 we may be unable to attract hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce including key management  

the talents and efforts of our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations could make it more difficult for employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which we have operations and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success 

 27 

the conversions of our class b and class c common stock or series b and series c preferred stock into shares of class a common stock would result in voting dilution to and could impact the market price of our existing class a common stock  

the market price of our class a common stock could fall as a result of many factors under our us retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our us covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock in connection with the acquisition of visa europe we issued series b and series c preferred stock which will become convertible into class a common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims conversion of our class b and class c common stock into class a common stock or our series b and series c preferred stock into class a common stock would increase the amount of class a common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class a common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class a common stockholders 

holders of our class b and c common stock and series b and series c preferred stock may have different interests than our class a common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions  

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock and in certain specified circumstances holders of our series b and series c preferred stock can vote on certain significant transactions with respect to our class b and c common stock these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series b and series c preferred stock voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series b and series c preferred stock would either i receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or ii receive securities cash or other property that is different from what our class a common stockholders would receive because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class a common stock are our current and former financial institution clients they may have interests that diverge from our class a common stockholders as a result the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class a common stockholders 

delaware law provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could make a merger takeover attempt or change in control difficult  

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable for example except for limited exceptions

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that enables fast secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers merchants financial institutions businesses strategic partners and government entities our advanced transaction processing network visanet enables authorization clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products platforms and valueadded services 

overall economic conditions  our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal 2017  reflects continued uneven economic growth around the world 

legal entity reorganization  in february 2017 we completed a reorganization of visa europe and certain other legal entities to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations as a result of the reorganization during fiscal 2017 we recorded a nonrecurring noncash income tax provision of 15 billion  primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of visa europe associated with this reorganization the newlyformed visa foundation received all visa inc shares held by visa europe which were previously recorded as treasury stock 

debt issuance in september 2017 we issued fixedrate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of  25 billion  with maturities ranging between 5  and 30  years subsequent to our fiscal yearend in october 2017 we used the majority of the proceeds from this new debt to redeem the 175 billion  of senior notes that was scheduled to mature in december 2017 see note 8—debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

financial highlights our financial results for fiscal 2017  include the impact of several significant onetime items our asreported us gaap and adjusted nongaap net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below 



 we recorded net operating revenues of 184 billion  for fiscal 2017  an increase of 22  over the prior year primarily reflecting the operating revenues of visa europe and continued growth in nominal payments volume processed transactions and nominal crossborder volume the effect of exchange rate movements as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in an approximately negative one and a half  percentage point impact to our total operating growth 

 33 

total operating expenses for fiscal 2017  were 62 billion  compared to 72 billion  in fiscal 2016  the decrease over the prior year was primarily due to the 19 billion  loss in fiscal 2016 resulting from the effective settlement of the framework agreement between us and visa europe upon consummation of the transaction offset by the inclusion of visa europes operating expenses following the acquisition 

during fiscal 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of 296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities of the 296 million benefit 239 million relates to prior fiscal years see note 18—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

adjusted financial results our financial results for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years as they were either nonrecurring or had no cash impact as such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 



 34 

 adjusted operating expenses operating margin nonoperating expense income income taxes net income and diluted earnings per share are nongaap financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with us gaap the following tables reconcile our asreported financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap to the respective nongaap adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 







 common stock repurchases  during fiscal 2017  we repurchased 77 million  shares of our class a common stock in the open market using 69 billion  of cash on hand as of september 30 2017  we had remaining authorized funds of 39 billion  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to april 2017 have been completed see note 13—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

 35 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues nominal payments volume over the prior year posted doubledigit growth in the united states driven mainly by consumer credit nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted due to the inclusion of nominal payments volume related to visa europe for the 12 months ended june 30 2017 1  growth on a constantdollar basis which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements on our international payments volume was not significantly different from growth on a nominaldollar basis for the 12 months ended june 30 2017 1  and was 13  for the 12 months ended june 30 2016 1  growth in processed transactions reflects the inclusion of visa europes processed transactions for the 12 months ended september 30 2017 and three months ended september 30 2016

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visa products for purchased goods and services as well as the number of transactions processed on our network we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visa products our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

 37 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues  consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of visa products current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered 

international transaction revenues  are earned for crossborder transaction processing and currency conversion activities crossborder transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant international transaction revenues are primarily generated by crossborder payments and cash volume 

other revenues  consist mainly of license fees for use of the visa brand fees for account holder services certification and licensing and other activities related to our acquired entities and with respect to fiscal 2016 and 2015 revenues earned from visa europe in accordance with the visa europe framework agreement prior to the completion of the visa europe acquisition other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended account holder protection and concierge services   

client incentives consist of longterm contracts with financial institution clients merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visa product acceptance win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues

 the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects the operating revenues of visa europe and continued growth in nominal payments volume processed transactions and nominal crossborder volume these benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues international transaction revenues and client incentives are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars the effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2017 as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in an approximately negative one and a half  percentage point impact to our net operating revenue growth 

the following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues including operating revenues earned by visa europe for fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 other revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015 also included revenue earned from visa europe in accordance with the framework agreement prior to its acquisition on june 21 2016

total operating expenses decreased primarily due to the 19 billion  loss related to the effective settlement of the framework agreement between visa and visa europe recorded during fiscal 2016 the remaining components of total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of visa europe expenses additional factors impacting our operating expenses are discussed below

effective income tax rate 

in february 2017 to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations we completed a reorganization of visa europe and certain other legal entities as a result of the reorganization we recorded a nonrecurring noncash income tax provision of 15 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of visa europe associated with this reorganization the newlyformed visa foundation received all visa inc shares held by visa europe that were previously recorded as treasury stock 

 41 

the effective income tax rate was 43  in fiscal 2017  and 25  in fiscal 2016  the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to 

 the effective income tax rate was 25 in fiscal 2016 and 30 in fiscal 2015 the effective rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to 

 adjusted effective income tax rate  our financial results for fiscal 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years as they are either nonrecurring or have no cash impact as such we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the tables below which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2017 and 2016 see overview—adjusted financial results  within this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 



 43 

operating activiti es cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was impacted by the inclusion of visa europe in our results for the full year while fiscal 2016 had one quarter of results that included visa europe other factors impacting cash provided by operating activities include 

 the cash inflows and outflows related to the us litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 19—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

investing activities  cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 reflected net proceeds from maturities and sales of availableforsale investment securities cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the upfront cash consideration paid in the visa europe acquisition offset by 28 billion of cash held by visa europe at the closing of the transaction in fiscal 2016 see note 2—visa europe   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected net purchases of availableforsale securities 

financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected 69 billion  used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market and 16 billion  of dividend payments partially offset by 25 billion  net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in september 2017 cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected 159 billion  net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in december 2015 partially offset by 70 billion  used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market and 14 billion  of dividend payments cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected payments of 426 million  made from the us litigation escrow account in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  note 8—debt  note 13—stockholders equity  and note 19—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide we believe that cash flow generated from operations in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries primarily attributable to undistributed earnings totaled 69 billion at september 30 2017  following our legal entity reorganization in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we returned net 50 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to the united states in fiscal 2017 this transaction did not constitute a return of undistributed earnings and was not subject to us income taxes if it were necessary to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the united states we would be required to pay us income taxes on the repatriated earnings it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of the undistributed earnings outside of the united states as such we have not accrued any us income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately 129 billion  of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these undistributed earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable 

availableforsale investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 35 billion  are classified as current and are available to meet shortterm liquidity needs the remaining noncurrent investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however are also generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

 44 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30 2017  see note 8—debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

credit facility on january 27 2016 we entered into an unsecured 40 billion  revolving credit facility on january 27 2017 we extended the term of the credit facility which will now expire on january 27 2022  there were no borrowings under the credit facility as of september 30 2017  and we were in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended september 30 2017  see note 8—debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

universal shelf registration statement in july 2015 we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions this registration statement expires in july 2018 

longterm debt  in september 2017 we issued fixedrate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 25 billion  with maturities ranging between 5  and 30  years we also issued in december 2015 fixedrate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 160 billion  with maturities ranging between 2  and 30  years subsequent to our fiscal yearend in october 2017 we used the majority of the proceeds from the september 2017 debt issuance to redeem the 175 billion  of senior notes that was scheduled to mature in december 2017 we are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of these debt issuances see note 8—debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

us litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the us retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a us litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation will be payable when we fund the us litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 19—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report the balance in this account at september 30 2017  was 10 billion  and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the us covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2017  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

 45 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlements in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions in general during fiscal 2017  we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of 426 million we hold about 7 billion of available liquidity in the form of cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle 

us covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the us covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation are payable from the us litigation escrow account during fiscal 2017  we made no  covered litigation payments that were funded from the us litigation escrow account at september 30 2017  the us litigation escrow account had an available balance of 10 billion  in june 2016 the approval of the 2012 settlement agreement was reversed by the us court of appeals for the second circuit until the appeals process is complete it is uncertain whether the company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement if the settlement agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation account into settlement funds pursuant to the settlement agreement we will have the right to approximately 30 billion which would be returned to the us litigation escrow account this will increase our taxable income thereby increasing our taxes to be paid by approximately 11 billion see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans   and   note 19—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the us covered litigation including ve territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding could give rise to future liquidity needs 

common stock repurchases  during fiscal 2017  we repurchased 77 million  shares of our class a common stock in the open market using 69 billion  of cash on hand as of september 30 2017  we had remaining authorized funds of 39 billion  in april 2017 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for 50 billion  this authorization has no expiration date all share repurchase programs authorized prior to april 2017 have been completed see note 13—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

dividends  during fiscal 2017  we declared and paid 16 billion  in dividends in october 2017  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 0195  per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and c common stock and series b and c preferred stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 459 million  in connection with this dividend on december 5 2017  see note 13—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by the board of directors all preferred and class b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the united states as a result of the acquisition of visa europe we assumed the obligations related to visa europes defined benefit plan primarily consisting of the uk pension plans our policy with respect to our us qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in september of each year an amount not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our us nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis in relation to the visa europe uk pension plans our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed with the uk pension plan trustees in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 we made contributions to our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans of 12 million  4 million  and 19 million  respectively for visa europes uk pension plans we made contributions of 5 million  and 102 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans in fiscal 2018  given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans and visa europes uk defined benefit pension plans by approximately 3 million  and 5 million  respectively the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan

capital expenditures  our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2017  due to investments in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives 

acquisitions in february 2017 we acquired a business using 302 million of cash on hand primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received the acquisition will help visas clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce on june 21 2016 we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe a payments technology business the acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses and benefits related to visa europes transition from an association to a forprofit enterprise we paid upfront cash consideration of €122 billion 139 billion and issued preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class a common stock equivalent to a value of €53 billion 61 billion at the closing stock price of 7733 on june 21 2016 also in connection with the purchase we will pay an additional €10 billion plus 4 compound annual interest on the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition see note 2—visa europe  and note 6—intangible assets and goodwill  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2017  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 143 billion  of assets and 98 million  of liabilities none of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

indemnifications 

we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see   note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 10—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2017 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

 48 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language eg early termination clauses managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using clientreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients merchants and business partners 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2017  client incentives represented 20  of gross operating revenues 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plans mechanisms include the use of the us litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the us litigation escrow account balance we did not record an accrual for the us covered litigation during fiscal 2017 our europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liabilities and losses relating to the covered period subject to certain limitations and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the european commission proceedings or any other matter see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 19—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 19—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

 49 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated nonfunctional currency denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 31 billion  and 27 billion  at september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2017  is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10  increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately 210 million  or loss of approximately 250 million  respectively on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2017  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 11—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

on june 21 2016 we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe on the third anniversary of the closing we will pay additional purchase consideration of € 1 billion  plus 40  compounded annual interest see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the us dollar against the euro a hypothetical 10  decline in the us dollar against the euro compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2017  would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by 130 million  including interest 

 50 

we are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of visa europe is the euro translation from the euro to the us dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10  change in the euro against the us dollar compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2017  would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 2 billion  we designate a portion of our eurodenominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of 188 billion  in visa europe changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period partially offset the foreign currency translation of the companys net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the companys consolidated balance sheet see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  and note 11—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this report 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our operating results or cash flows have been nor are they expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2017  and 2016  were 64 billion  and 51 billion  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately 29 million  on our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2017  the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 18 billion  and 22 billion  at september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2017  and 2016  our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 11 billion  at each year end and projected benefit obligations were 09 billion  and 11 billion  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10  decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1  decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 241 million  in the funded status and an increase of approximately 44 million  in pension cost 

at september 30 2017  and 2016  our nonus defined benefit pension plan assets were 433 million  and 415 million  respectively and projected benefit obligations were 433 million  and 474 million  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10  decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1  decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 157 million  in the funded status and an increase of approximately 11 million  in pension cost 

we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2018  if any which would be made in september 2018

controls and procedures 

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures

our vision is to be the best way to pay and be paid for everyone everywhere to deliver on this vision we focus on six strategic goals 

 visa is one of the world’s largest retail electronic payments network based on payments volume number of transactions and number of cards in circulation 

visa network 

 total volume includes europe for the fourth quarter 

visa operates in a four party model which includes card issuing financial institutions acquirers and merchants we are not a bank and do not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on visa products in most cases our financial institution clients are responsible for and manage account holder and merchant relationships 

we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visa products interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our openloop payments network we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process but we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in addition we do not receive as revenue any of the fees that merchants are charged directly for acceptance by the acquirers

visa brand 

the visa brand is one of the most wellknown and valuable brands in the world anchored on the notion that visa is everywhere you want to be the brand stands for acceptance security convenience and universality in recognition of its strength among clients and consumers the visa brand is ranked highly in a number of widely recognized brand studies including the 2016 brandz top 100 most valuable global brands study 6 interbrand’s 2016 best global brands 61 and forbes 2016 world’s most valuable brands 30 we leverage our brand strength to deliver added value to financial institutions merchants and other clients through compelling brand expressions expanded products and services and innovative marketing efforts 

payment security 

security is critical to maintaining trust and confidence in electronic payments to ensure that visa remains one of the safest ways to pay and be paid we deploy a multilayered security approach focused on eliminating vulnerable data from the payments environment securing the data that remains preventing fraud and empowering system participants to protect themselves this approach has historically kept fraud rates low as payment volumes have grown with commerce moving to digital channels we are investing in new technologies and solutions in order to maintain the trust that consumers clients and merchants place in visa this requires innovation leadership and crossindustry collaboration

fiscal 2016 key statistics 

please see item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a reconciliation of our adjusted financial results 

key initiatives 

visa europe acquisition    prior to our 2007 reorganization visa operated as a collection of memberowned associations with each region serving its member financial institutions and administering visa programs within a global framework in 2007 visa reorganized with all of the regions except visa europe coming together to form visa inc a delaware corporation visa europe remained owned by its european member financial institutions   

on june 21 2016 we acquired visa europe we believe the acquisition positions our company to create additional value through increased scale efficiencies realized by integration of the businesses and benefits related to visa europes transition from a memberowned association to a forprofit enterprise we plan to bring visas global capabilities to our european clients deliver a more seamless experience operating as one single global company and grow our business in that region as part of the acquisition we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe for €122 billion 139 billion and €53 billion 61 billion in preferred stock with an additional €10 billion plus 4 compound annual interest to be paid on june 21 2019 

capital structure    in december 2015 we issued 16 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging between two and 30 years and in june 2016 we issued two new series of preferred stock to visa europes member financial institutions that are convertible into approximately 79 million shares of class a common stock as part of the visa europe transaction we also have plans to raise an additional 2 billion in debt by the end of calendar year 2016 subject to market conditions 

technology transformation at its heart visa is a technology company with the intensifying digital economy and the ubiquity of mobile technology data and enhanced security driving the future of payments we embarked on a multiyear journey in 2015 to transform technology at visa with the main areas of focus on opening our network and creating a digital platform for innovation while at the same time adding layers of security and operational resilience we have executed on our workforce plan by hiring a total of 1700 technology employees globally over the past two years including nearly 750 new college graduates replacing a significant percentage of our contractor and vendor spend we are making steady progress on our technology strategic roadmap resulting in enhanced services for our ecosystem stakeholders and positive impacts to our infrastructure since the launch of visa’s developer platform vdp in 2015 more than 180 of visa’s product or service functions are available in api or application program interface format to our clients and partners we added new services to enable clients to develop support for tokenized transactions and create new and innovative solutions in mobile ecommerce and digital facetoface transactions cybersecurity remains a top focus and in fiscal 2016 we launched our new threat intelligence fusion platform a cyber command and control center that provides integrated cybersecurity operations to further help protect our data and assets at the same time new open technologies have been added

visanet is capable of handling more than 65000 transactions per second reliably conveniently and securely in fiscal 2016 visa processed over 83 billion payment and cash disbursement authorization transactions which included europe during the fourth quarter visanet is built on a centralized architecture enabling us to analyze each authorization we process in real time and provide valueadded processing services such as risk scoring and tokenization it provides the infrastructure for delivering innovation and other payment system enhancements for domestic payment systems and cross border international transactions globally 

a typical visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her visa product to a merchant as payment for goods or services the transaction is then sent to the acquirer and routed over visanet or visa europes processing platform to an issuer for an authorization decision the transaction is either approved or declined and routed back to the acquirer and merchant usually in a matter of seconds

digital products 

visa checkout  visa checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online transactions wherever visa checkout is enabled visa checkout helps merchants convert higher numbers of consumers to sale a particularly important issue as digital commerce shifts from desktop devices to mobile devices which have lower conversion rates at the end of fiscal 2016 visa checkout had over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries seven languages and over 1400 financial institution partners across the globe participating more than 300000 merchants including some of the largest global retailers accept visa checkout in october 2016 we rolled out a redesigned visa checkout experience making it easier for consumers to enroll and complete purchases on mobile devices we recently announced that we are opening the visa checkout platform to clients and partners allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into visa checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout 

visa direct  visa direct is a push payment product platform that facilitates payerinitiated transactions that are sent directly to the visa account of the recipient it supports faster payments use cases like persontoperson p2p payments and disbursements we are working with key partners including processors like fiserv fis and jack henry  associates and originators like early warning ews ingo money hyperwallet wells fargo and qiwi along with merchants to expand the distribution and usage of push payments

we have also extended our fraud prediction capabilities to merchants via visa transaction advisor our first implementation of this product is at fuel pumps whereby we provide a risk indicator to the merchant for each visa card transaction so the merchant can decide if they would like to require incremental authentication for risky transactions fuel merchants using our visa transaction advisor product have seen a significant decline in counterfeit fraud rates and in lost and stolen fraud chargebacks

purchases and to reduce disputes and fraud related to the use of visa payment products visa consumer authentication service is a hosted solution for issuers on verified by visa transactions delivering protection against online fraud through riskbased authentication issuers have full control of when and how they decide to authenticate based on their transaction risk threshold existing frauddetection tools operational requirements and user demands 

we also launched visa consumer transaction controls in fiscal 2016 which allow account holders to place restrictions on their enrolled cards that define when where and how those cards can be used to better manage account spending and security issuers can utilize this solution across their entire card portfolio 

emv migration in the united states to enhance payment security and mitigate counterfeit fraud we have been working with us merchants and financial institutions to encourage the adoption of emv chip payment technology emv which stands for europay mastercard and visa is a global standard for chip cards and chip terminals chip technology generates a onetime use code for every transaction that is used to authenticate that the transaction is originating from a valid ie not fraudulent card under policies announced by visa in 2011 effective october 2015 the party that has not adopted the more secure chip technology is responsible for any resulting counterfeit fraud over the last year there has been steady growth in chip card issuance and in the activation of chipenabled terminals as of september 30 2016 more than 373 million visa chip cards have been issued making the united states the largest chip card market in the world nearly 16 million merchant locations in the united states are now chipenabled or roughly 30 of all us merchants that accept visa cards at the physical point of sale over 30 of us instore payment volume is now being processed as chip transactions we continue to work to help improve the merchant and account holder experience with the roll out of quick chip a solution designed to reduce the time it takes to complete a chip transaction we are also working with merchants and acquirers to simplify the terminal certification process and have taken steps to limit merchants’ exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for those that have had challenges getting terminals certified and activated 

significant business developments

interchange multidistrict litigation  visa mastercard and various us financial institutions are defendants in class and individual actions challenging among other things visa’s and mastercard’s purported setting of interchange reimbursement fees and certain network rules in 2012 visa mastercard various us financial institution defendants and class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs’ claims on january 14 2014 the us district court for the eastern district of new york entered a final judgment order approving the settlement from which a number of objectors appealed on june 30 2016 the us court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the lower courts certification of the merchant class and reversed the approval of the settlement the second circuit determined that the class plaintiffs were inadequately represented and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its decision prior to november 23 2016 class plaintiffs may file a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court seeking review of the second circuit’s decision until the appeals process is complete it is uncertain whether the company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement see item 1a—risk factors—we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place  and item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  of this report for more information 

intellectual property 

we own and manage the visa brand which stands for acceptance security convenience and universality our portfolio of trademarks in particular our family of visa marks our plus mark and our dove design mark are important to our business we give our clients access to these assets through agreements with our issuers and acquirers which authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network we also own a number of patents patent applications and other intellectual property relating to payment solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the us and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

net operating revenues

revenue details 

competition 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change existing and emerging competitors compete with visa for consumers financial institution clients and merchant participation in our network and payment solutions technology and innovation is shifting consumer habits and driving growth opportunities in ecommerce mobile payments block chain technology and digital currencies these advances are enabling new entrants many of which depart from traditional network payment models in certain countries the evolving regulatory landscape is changing how we compete creating local networks or enabling processing competition 

we compete against all forms of payment this includes paperbased payments primarily cash and checks and all forms of electronic payments our electronic payment competitors principally include 

 11 

global or multiregional networks which typically offer a range of branded general purpose card payment products that can be used at millions of merchant locations around the world examples include mastercard american express discover and jcb these competitors may be more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the us or have a leading position in certain countries for example unionpay operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china based on available data visa is one of the largest retail electronic funds transfer networks used throughout the world the following chart compares our network with these network competitors for calendar year 2015 1  

 

local and regional networks that operate   in many countries often with the support of government influence or mandate in some cases they are owned by financial intuitions these networks typically focus on debit payment products have functionality or their brand marks present with the visa brand on the card or payment device and may have strong local acceptance and recognizable brands examples include star nyce and pulse in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia 

alternate payment providers which often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels these companies may process payments using inhouse account transfers between parties electronic funds transfer networks like the automated clearing house ach or global or local networks like visa in some cases these entities are both a partner and a competitor to visa examples include paypal and alipay 

other electronic payment networks like   the ach in the us are often created and governed by local governments historically focused on interbank transfers many are adding capabilities that may make them more competitive for retail payments we also compete with closedloop payment systems wire transfers and electronic benefit transfers 

payment processors where we face competition for the processing of visa transactions or are not permitted to do so under local regulation for example as a result of regulation in europe under the second payment services directive psd2 we may face competition from other networks processors and other thirdparties who could process visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients we believe our fundamental value proposition of acceptance security convenience and universality offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate we do so by partnering with local financial institutions merchants governments nongovernmental 

 12 

organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015 accounted for more than 30 of our operating revenues in those years 

working capital 

payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

financial information about geographic areas 

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 13—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  included elsewhere in this report 

government regulation 

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used the most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below for further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business see item 1a — risk factors — regulatory risks 

supervisory oversight of the payments industry  visa is subject to financial sector oversight and regulation in substantially all of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the us the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec has supervisory oversight over visa under applicable federal banking laws and policies the federal banking agencies comprising the ffiec are the federal reserve board the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation and the national credit union administration visa also may be examined by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb as a service provider to the banks that issue visabranded consumer credit and debit card products central banks in other countries including russia ukraine hong kong and europe as discussed below have recognized or designated visa for purposes of various degrees of financial stability regulation as a retail payment system visa is also subject to oversight by banking and financial sector authorities in other jurisdictions such as brazil mexico and colombia 

governmentimposed market participation and restrictions  certain governments including china russia and india have taken actions to advantage domestic payments systems andor certain issuers payments networks or processors including by imposing regulations that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic processing be done entirely in that country 

interchange rates and fees an increasing number of jurisdictions around the world regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the doddfrank act in the us limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions the eu’s interchange fee regulation ifr limits interchange rates in europe as discussed below and the reserve bank of australia has regulated average permissible levels of interchange for over a decade 

network exclusivity and routing  in the us the doddfrank act limits network exclusivity and preferred routing for the debit and prepaid market segments other jurisdictions impose similar limitations such as the ifr’s prohibition on restrictions that prevent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card 

nosurcharge rules we have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa products instead of other means however merchants’ ability to surcharge varies by geographic market as well as visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation 

privacy and data protection aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulations which impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even 

 13 

impact our ability to offer a product or service in addition regulators are proposing new laws or regulations which could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity practices in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and such notification requirements continue to increase in scope and cost the european union’s general data protection regulation which will become effective in may 2018 will create new individual privacy rights and impose worldwide obligations on companies handling personal data 

anticorruption antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions we are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage we are also subject to antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac in the us 

internet transactions many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor identify filter restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the internet such as gambling and the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of other issues including mobile payment transactions tokenization money transfer identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients and us 

european regulations and supervisory oversight in addition following the visa europe acquisition in june 2016 we are subject to complex and evolving regulation of our business in the european union visa europe has been designated as a recognized payment system bringing it within the scope of the bank of england’s oversight to ensure the financial stability of the uk visa europe is also subject to the eurosystem’s oversight including the security of payment instruments and ecommerce security policies and scheme rules furthermore visa europe is regulated by the uk’s payment systems regulator psr which has wide ranging powers and authority to review our business practices systems rules and fees with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the uk and ensuring payments meet account holder needs it also is the regulator responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in the uk outside the uk in relation to ifr visa is also subject to compliance monitoring by national competent authorities in all markets the ifr regulates interchange rates within europe requires visa europe to separate its payment card scheme activities from processing activities for accounting organization and decision making purposes within the eu and imposes limitations on network exclusivity and routing 

there are other regulations in the eu that impact our business as discussed above including privacy and data protection antibribery antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions other recent regulatory changes in europe such as the psd2 could reduce perceived barriers to entry for emerging noncard payments

 item 1a risk factors   

regulatory risks 

 14 

increased regulation of the global payments industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees operating rules and related practices could harm our business  

regulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry see  item 1 business —government regulation for more information   in the us and many other jurisdictions we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues 

interchange reimbursement fees certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees rules and practices for example in 2011 in accordance with the us doddfrank act the us federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent this amounted to a significant reduction in the average systemwide interchange reimbursement fees received by large issuers the doddfrank act also limited issuers and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacted our business in 2015 the eu’s ifr placed an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross border transactions 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively significantly reducing the fees received by eu issuers eu member states have the ability to further restrict these interchange levels within their territories more recently in september 2016 argentinas senate approved a bill to reduce existing caps on the merchant discount rate charged by acquirers to 15 for credit transactions and zero for debit transactions 

in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business for example government regulations or pressure may require or allow other networks to be supported by visa products or services or to have the other networks functionality or brand marks on our products as innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence in addition the eu’s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and could impact the efficient integration of visa europe the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategies our ability to provide effective customer service and the amount of data available for use in fraud and risk systems and loyalty services 

we are also subject to central bank oversight in the uk and the eu this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirements we could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for financial institution participation in and access to our payments system additionally regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles 

regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other’s approaches to regulating the payments industry consequently a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another the risks created by a new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings the us doddfrank act and the eu ifr are developments with such potential as are approaches taken by regulators in australia canada and other countries see note 20—legal matters  of this report similarly new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example credit payments could become subject to the same regulation as debit payments additionally regulation in an individual country could continue and expand for example in australia the reserve bank of australia rba initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange as well 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems such as our competitors closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers we believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees to consumers making our products less appealing to consumers some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate 

 15 

payments systems or forms of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge which may directly impact our revenues for these reasons increased global regulation of the payments industry may make our products less desirable diminish our ability to compete reduce our transaction volumes and harm our business 

governmentimposed restrictions on payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries  

governments in various jurisdictions such as in asia and the gulf cooperation countries in the middle east protect certain domestic payment card networks brands and processors these governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country which would prevent us from overseeing the endtoend processing of certain transactions in china for example unionpay continues to enjoy advantages over other international networks remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark though the chinese state council has announced that international schemes such as visa would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china the full implementation guidelines for bcci’s have yet to be finalized in russia legislation has effectively prevented us from processing in the domestic market and mandated that we migrate our domestic processing business to the stateowned nspk or national payment card system which is the only entity allowed to process domestically 

due to our inability to oversee the endtoend processing of transactions for cards carrying our brands in these countries we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or third party processors in these regions to ensure transactions involving our products are processed effectively national laws that protect domestic processing may increase our costs decrease the number of visa products issued or processed impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and control the quality of the services supporting our brands restrict our activities force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets all of which could harm our ability to operate our business maintain or increase our revenues globally and extend our global brands 

we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results  

as a global payments technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations see item 1 — business — government regulation  for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulations on us and on our clients and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules or require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules and it may increase our compliance costs and reduce our revenue opportunities we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion pointofsale transaction rules and practices privacy data use or protection and associated product technology as a result the visa rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities further as regulations change they may affect our existing contractual arrangements 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services and fees and other important aspects of our business in the various regions where we operate our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve however we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal penalties litigation and damage to our global brands and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could reduce the number of visa products our clients issue the volume of payments we process and our revenue negatively impact our brands and our competitive positioning and limit the types of products and services that we offer the countries in which our products are used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products all of which could harm our business 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in the tax laws  

 16 

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service the uk’s hm revenue  customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform or those resulting from the base erosion and profit shifting beps project being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

litigation risks 

we may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations despite certain protections that are in place  

we are involved in numerous civil actions and government investigations alleging violations of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law and intellectual property law among others details of the claims and the status of those proceedings are described more fully in note 20—legal matters  legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations in the event we are found liable in any material litigation proceedings or investigations particularly in a large class action lawsuit or an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements in addition settlement terms judgments or pressures resulting from legal proceedings or investigations may require us to modify the default interchange reimbursement rates we set revise the visa rules or the way in which we enforce our rules modify our fees or pricing or modify the way we do business which may harm our business finally we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation asserted against them even if visa is not a defendant 

for certain litigation matters like the us covered litigation and the ve territory covered litigation which are described in note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 20—legal matters  we have certain protections provided for in the respective retrospective responsibility plans the two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are able to either fund the settlements and judgments in the case of the us covered litigation or recoup covered losses in the case of the ve territory covered litigation the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements judgments losses or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

business risks 

we face intense competition in our industry  

the global payments space is intensely competitive as technology evolves new competitors emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles our products compete with cash checks electronic funds virtual currency payments global or multiregional networks other closedloop payments systems and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels as the global payments space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our clients emerging payment providers and other digital and technology companies many of these providers have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels and are seeking to expand into other channels that compete with or replace our products and services 

additionally some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources they may offer a wider range of programs products and services including some that are more innovative they may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and greater issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate in different market segments those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to 

 17 

regulatory technological and other developments in some cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions 

some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currency providers technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets and certain alternate payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers government actions or initiatives such as the us doddfrank act or the us federal reserve’s faster payments initiatives may provide them with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models similarly regulation in europe under psd2 and in the uk through the psr may require us to open up access to and allow participation in our network to additional participants and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitors we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments alternate payment credentials other ledger technologies or payment forms and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 18 

 

 

 

 our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth 

our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain  

our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services while we have certain contractual protections our clients including some of our largest clients generally have flexibility to issue nonvisa products further in certain circumstances our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

in order to stay competitive we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand their use and acceptance of visa products and services these include upfront cash payments fee discounts and rebates credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options market pressures on providing incentives fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset the financial impact of these incentives fee discounts and rebates it may harm our net revenues and profits 

in addition it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants in addition if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or cobrand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors it could result in our business shifting to a competitor which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business 

merchants and processors continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business  

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa products certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory enforcement filing lawsuits and in some cases refusing to accept visa products if they are successful in their efforts we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products in the us the cost of payment card acceptance has emerged in the context of payment security a number of merchant trade associations claim that emv cards without pin cardholder verification are not worth the investment the october 2015 liability shift and ongoing transition to emv resulted in calls for a pin verification mandate more recently us merchantaffiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the emv certification process some 

 19 

policymakers have called upon us competition authorities to consider potential concerns arising from the roles of industry bodies such as emvco and the payment card industry security standards council additionally some merchants and processors have pushed for changes to industry practices and our requirements for visa acceptance at the point of sale including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of visa products to mandate only pin authenticated transaction to differentiate or steer among visa product types issued by different financial institutions and to impose surcharges on customers presenting visa products as their form of payment if successful these efforts could adversely impact consumers usage of our products lead to regulatory enforcement andor litigation increase our compliance and litigation expenses and harm our business 

we depend on relationships with our financial institution clients acquirers merchants and other third parties  

we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with customers and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties for example in the us the emv migration has been resisted by certain merchants leading to conflicts and litigation concerning the timing and scope of the liability shift chargebacks and debit routing among others 

we engage in discussions with merchants acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we engage in many payment card cobranding efforts with merchants who receive incentives from us as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to continue to engage in these discussions in order to sustain and grow these relationships 

in addition we depend on third parties including suppliers and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf to the extent that such parties fail to perform or deliver adequate services our business and reputation could be harmed 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands if events occur that damage our reputation or brands or we experience brand disintermediation it could harm our business  

our brands are globally recognized and are key assets of our business we believe that our clients and customers associate our brands with acceptance security convenience and universality our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brands and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing products services and partnerships and uphold our corporate reputation the increased use or popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with large technology and financial institution companies could result in consumer confusion or brand disintermediation and decrease the value of our brand in addition our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including data security breaches compliance failures negative perception of our industry or the industries of our clients actions by clients or other third parties such as sponsorship partners that do not reflect our views or are inconsistent with our own business practices and fraudulent or other illegal activity using our payment products if we are unable to maintain our reputation or if events occur that damage our reputation the value of our brands may be impaired which could harm our relationships with clients customers and the public as well as impact our business 

global economic political market and social events or conditions may harm our business  

our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by customers governments and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in addition almost half of our operating revenues are earned outside the us international transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy therefore adverse macroeconomic conditions including recessions inflation high unemployment currency fluctuations actual or anticipated largescale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues in addition outbreaks of illnesses pandemics or other local or global health issues like the zika virus political uncertainties like brexit international hostilities armed conflict or unrest and natural disasters could impact our operations our clients and our activities in a particular location these events could also reduce crossborder travel and spend which impacts our international transaction revenues which are generated by processing crossborder payments and cash volume transactions as well as from foreign currency exchange transactions any 

 20 

such decline in crossborder activity could impact the number of crossborder transactions we process and our foreign currency exchange activities and in turn reduce our revenues 

a decline in economic conditions could impact our clients as well and their decisions to reduce the number of cards accounts and credit lines of their account holders which ultimately impact our revenues they may also implement costreduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets and decrease spending on optional or enhanced valueadded services from us 

any events or conditions that impair the functioning of the financial markets tighten the credit market or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms which could affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if clients default on their settlement obligations it may also impact our liquidity any of these events could adversely affect the growth of our volumes and revenue 

our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity  

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources which could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 11—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

the united kingdom’s proposed withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results  

in june 2016 a referendum was held in the united kingdom to determine whether the country should remain a member of the eu with voters approving withdrawal from the eu commonly referred to as brexit the uk government is working towards triggering article 50 of the lisbon treaty which will commence the official eu withdrawal process uncertainty over the terms of the uk’s departure from the eu could harm our business and financial results in addition other eu member countries may consider referendums regarding their eu membership any of these events along with any political changes that may occur as a result of brexit could cause political and economic uncertainty in europe as a result our operations in the uk resulting from the recent acquisition of visa europe as well as our global operations could be impacted 

the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the british pound and other currencies may harm our results of operations as the local currency results of our international operations may translate into fewer us dollars uncertainty over brexit and currency fluctuations could also impact our clients who may curtail or postpone investments in growing their credit portfolios limit credit lines modify fees and loyalty programs or take other actions that harm our volume and revenue 

in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the uk and eu we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the uk may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the eu and as a result our visa rules and contractual commitments in the uk may be impacted in addition because we conduct business in and have operations in the uk we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member states these factors may impact our ability to operate in the eu and uk seamlessly any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

technology and information security risks 

failure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact our future growth  

 21 

the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance technologies ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrency distributed ledger and blockchain technologies and as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including some potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies it is difficult however to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted it is also difficult to predict how these technologies may be regulated moreover some of these new technologies could be subject to intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or assertions potentially impacting our development efforts andor requiring us to obtain licenses if we or our partners fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our products and services to our clients impact our intellectual property or licensing rights and harm our business and impact our future growth 

a failure in or breach of our networks or systems including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our business  

our information security and processing systems as well as those of our clients merchants and other thirdparty service providers may experience damage or disruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunication failures computer viruses worms or other destructive software internal design manual or usage errors cyberattacks terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic events natural disasters and severe weather conditions our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put us at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempts additionally several merchants have encountered substantial cybersecurity breaches and rebreaches affecting their customers some of whom were visa account holders although these merchant breaches have not had a direct material impact on us we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we may be unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attacks to our business we may also be impacted by breaches of our financial institution clients and thirdparty processors that affect the broader payment system 

in addition numerous and evolving information security threats including advanced and persistent cyberattacks particularly on our internetfacing and reliant applications could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data the security measures and procedures we our clients merchants and other service providers have in place to protect sensitive account holder data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches cyberattacks or system failures although we devote significant resources to our information security program and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these known or unknown threats 

if we are sued in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices any of which could harm our business in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach cyberattack or system failure at one or more of our clients merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products which could harm our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally a breach may also subject visa to additional regulations or governmental or regulatory investigations which could result in significant compliance costs fines or enforcement actions or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions 

we may experience errors interruptions delays or cessations of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing systems which could significantly disrupt our operations impact our clients and customers damage our reputation result in litigation violations of applicable privacy and other laws and regulatory fines or penalties decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions assets and data through our current business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise 

structural and organizational risks 

failure to maintain interoperability with visa europes systems during the integration phase of our acquisition could damage the business and global perception of our brands  

 22 

while visa europes systems are being integrated with our legacy systems we and visa europe will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement systems as a result we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories regardless of where it originates visa europes independent system operations could present challenges to our business in the event of increasing costs or difficulties in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems during the integration phase the separation of payment card scheme and processing may also exacerbate this risk any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between visa europe and our legacy operations could negatively affect the experience of customers using visa products globally failure to authorize clear and settle interterritory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands 

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the visa europe acquisition or those of our other strategic investments or acquisitions and may face other risks and uncertainties as a result  

in june 2016 we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe we believe the acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses and benefits related to visa europe’s transition from an association to a forprofit enterprise although there can be no guarantee that we will realize these benefits in addition we may make other strategic investments or acquisitions which like the visa europe acquisition are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside our control the visa europe acquisition involves and any future strategic endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties which could include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 we may be unable to attract hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce including key management  

 23 

the talents and efforts of our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success 

the conversions of our class b and class c common stock or series b and series c preferred stock into shares of class a common stock would result in voting dilution to and could impact the market price of our existing class a common stock  

the market price of our class a common stock could fall as a result of many factors under our us retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our us covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock in connection with the acquisition of visa europe we issued series b and series c preferred stock which will become convertible into class a common stock in stages based on developments in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than 2028 subject to a holdback to cover any pending claims conversion of our class b and class c common stock into class a common stock or our series b and series c preferred stock into class a common stock would increase the amount of class a common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class a common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class a common stockholders 

holders of our class b and c common stock and series b and series c preferred stock may have different interests than our class a common stockholders concerning certain significant transactions  

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock and in certain specified circumstances holders of our series b and series c preferred stock can vote on certain significant transactions with respect to our class b and c common stock these transactions include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series b and series c preferred stock voting rights are limited to proposed consolidations or mergers in which holders of the series b and series c preferred stock would either i receive shares of stock or other equity securities with preferences rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences rights and privileges of the applicable series of preferred stock or ii receive securities cash or other property that is different from what our class a common stockholders would receive because the holders of classes of capital stock other than class a common stock are our current and former financial institution clients they may have interests that diverge from our class a common stockholders as a result the holders of these classes of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with interests of our class a common stockholders 

delaware law provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could make a merger takeover attempt or change in control difficult  

provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our capital structure could delay or prevent a merger takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable for example except for limited exceptions

debt issuance in december 2015 we issued fixedrate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 160 billion with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years interest on these notes at a rate ranging between 120 and 430 is payable semiannually on june 14 and december 14 commencing june 14 2016 the net aggregate proceeds of 159 billion  after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs were used to fund the upfront cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of visa europe and for general corporate purposes including share repurchases see note 4—fair value measurements and investments   and note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

financial highlights our financial results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of several significant onetime items our asreported us gaap and adjusted nongaap net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below 

 30 



 we recorded net operating revenues of 151 billion  for fiscal 2016 an increase of 9  over the prior year driven by continued growth in processed transactions nominal payments volume as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of visa europe  the effect of exchange rate movements as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our total operating growth 

total operating expenses for fiscal 2016 were 72 billion  compared to 48 billion  in fiscal 2015 the increase over the prior year was primarily due to the 19 billion loss resulting from the effective settlement of the framework agreement between us and visa europe upon consummation of the transaction combined with acquisitionrelated costs of approximately 152 million see note 2—acquisition of visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of 296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities of the 296 million benefit 239 million relates to prior fiscal years our financial results for the year ended september 30 2014 reflect a onetime tax benefit of 191 million associated with a deduction for us domestic production activities related to prior fiscal years see note 19—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

adjusted financial results our financial results for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years as they are either nonrecurring have no cash impact or are covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan as such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented

 common stock repurchases  during fiscal 2016  we repurchased 91 million  shares of our class a common stock in the open market using 70 billion  of cash on hand as of september 30 2016  we had remaining authorized funds of 58 billion  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2015 have been completed see note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues 

 33 

nominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the us driven mainly by consumer debit and credit nominal international payments volume was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the us dollar on a constantdollar basis which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended june 30 2016 1 and 2015 was 37  and 13 respectively processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visa products for purchased goods and services as well as the number of transactions processed on our network we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visa products our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues  consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of visa products current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally 

 35 

data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered 

international transaction revenues  are earned for crossborder transaction processing and currency conversion activities crossborder transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant international transaction revenues are primarily generated by crossborder payments and cash volume 

other revenues  consist mainly of license fees for use of the visa brand revenues earned from visa europe in accordance with the visa europe framework agreement prior to the completion of the visa europe acquisition fees for account holder services certification and licensing and other activities related to our acquired entities other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended account holder protection and concierge services   

client incentives consist of longterm contracts with financial institution clients merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visa product acceptance win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel expenses include salaries employee benefits incentive compensation sharebased compensation severance charges and contractor expense 

marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions of the visa brand 

network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the us internationally and in accordance with the framework agreement prior to the visa europe acquisition on june 21 2016 visa europe revenue earned for the three months ended september 30 2016 is included in international 



 the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of visa europe  these benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues international transaction revenues and client incentives are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars the effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2016 as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our net operating revenue growth 

the following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues including operating revenues earned by visa europe for the three months ended september 30 2016 other revenues also includes revenue earned from visa europe in accordance with the framework agreement prior to its acquisition on june 21 2016

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses 





 38 

costs an increase in personnel costs that were invested in and capitalized as part of technology development projects and lower incentive compensation the increase in fiscal 2015  was primarily due to an increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth combined with higher incentive compensation

 see note 4—fair value measurements and investments   and note 12—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements 

effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate was 25  in fiscal 2016  and 30  in fiscal 2015  the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to 

 the effective income tax rates were 30 in fiscal 2015  and 2014  the following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year 

 adjusted effective income tax rate  our financial results for fiscal 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years as they are either nonrecurring or have no cash impact as such we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2016 see overview  adjusted financial results  within this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 



 41 

operating activiti es cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the visa europe acquisition and the us interchange multidistrict litigation including 

 the cash inflows and outflows related to the us litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to the upfront cash consideration paid in the visa europe acquisition offset by 28 billion of cash held by visa europe at the closing of the transaction cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of availableforsale securities and an increase in purchases of availableforsale securities see note 2—acquisition of visa europe   and note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

financing activities cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects 159 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in december 2015 70 billion used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market and 14 billion of dividend payments cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan as follows 

 the remainder of the change in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  note 9—debt  note 14—stockholders equity  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide we believe that cash flow generated from operations in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled 87 billion at september 30 2016  if it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the us we would be required to pay us income taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the us as such we have not accrued any us income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately 83 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds the amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these funds been repatriated is not practicably determinable 

availableforsale investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 39 billion  are classified as noncurrent as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however these investments are generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

 42 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30 2016  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

credit facility on january 27 2016  we entered into an unsecured 40 billion  revolving credit facility the credit facility which expires on january 27 2021  replaced our previous 30 billion  credit facility which expired on january 27 2016  the new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type there were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended september 30 2016  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

universal shelf registration statement in july 2015 we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions this registration statement expires in july 2018 

longterm debt and change in capital structure  in conjunction with the visa europe acquisition we have evolved our longterm capital structure in december 2015 we issued fixedrate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 160 billion with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years our first principal payment of 18 billion is due on december 14 2017 interest on the notes at a rate ranging between 120 and 430 is payable semiannually on june 14 and december 14 of each year an interest payment of 244 million was made on june 14 2016 the notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at our option at any time prior to maturity at a specified redemption price the net aggregate proceeds of 159 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of 127 million were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of visa europe and for general corporate purposes including share repurchases we are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements we expect to issue additional debt of about 20 billion by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 market conditions permitting 

us litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the us retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a us litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation will be payable when we fund the us litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2016  was 10 billion  and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the us covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2016  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

 43 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement most us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlements in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions in general during fiscal 2016  we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of 242 million 

visa europe acquisition  on june 21 2016 we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe a payments technology business the acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses and benefits related to visa europes transition from an association to a forprofit enterprise we paid upfront cash consideration of €122 billion 139 billion and issued preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class a common stock equivalent to a value of €53 billion 61 billion at the closing stock price of 7733 on june 21 2016 also in connection with the purchase we will pay an additional €10 billion plus 4 compound annual interest on the third anniversary of the closing see note 2—acquisition of visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements 

us covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the us covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation are payable from the us litigation escrow account during fiscal 2016  we made 45 million  in covered litigation payments that were funded from the us litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with individual optout merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings at september 30 2016  the us litigation escrow account had an available balance of 10 billion  in june 2016 the approval of the 2012 settlement agreement was reversed by the us court of appeals for the second circuit until the appeals process is complete it is uncertain whether the company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement if the settlement agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation account into settlement funds pursuant to the settlement agreement we will have the right to approximately 30 billion which would be returned to the us litigation escrow account this will increase our taxable income thereby increasing our taxes to be paid by approximately 11 billion see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans   and   note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the us covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs 

common stock repurchases  during fiscal 2016  we repurchased 91 million  shares of our class a common stock in the open market using 70 billion  of cash on hand as of september 30 2016  we had remaining authorized funds of 58 billion  in october 2015 and july 2016 our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for 50 billion  each these authorizations have no expiration date all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2015 have been completed see note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

dividends  during fiscal 2016  we declared and paid 14 billion  in dividends in october 2016  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 0165  per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock and uki and europe preferred stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 400 million  in connection with this dividend on december 6 2016  see note 14—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by the board of directors all preferred and class b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the us as a result of the acquisition of visa europe we assumed the obligations related to visa europes defined benefit plan primarily consisting of the uk pension plans our policy with respect to our us qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in september of each year an amount not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our us nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis in relation to the visa europe uk pension plans our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our uk pension plans additional amounts may be agreed with the uk pension plan trustees in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 we made contributions to our us pension and other postretirement plans of 4 million  19 million  and 

 44 

14 million  respectively for visa europes uk pension plans we made contributions of 102 million subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans in fiscal 2017  given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding our us and visa europes uk defined benefit pension plans by approximately 12 million  and 6 million  respectively the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences see note 10—pension postretirement and other benefits  to our consolidated financial statements 

capital expenditures  our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2016  due to investments in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2016  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 120 billion  of assets and 136 million  of liabilities none of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

indemnifications 

we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see   note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 11—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2016 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language eg early termination clauses managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customerreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients merchants and business partners 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2016  client incentives represented 18  of gross operating revenues 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plans mechanisms include the use of the us litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the us litigation escrow account balance we did not record an accrual for the us covered litigation during fiscal 2016 our europe 

 47 

retrospective responsibility plan only covers visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liabilities and losses relating to the covered period subject to certain limitations see note 3—us and europe retrospective responsibility plans  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 20—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated nonfunctional currency denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 27 billion  and 12 billion  at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2016  is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10  increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately 160 million  or loss of approximately 190 million  respectively on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2016  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 12—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments   to our consolidated financial statements 

on june 21 2016 we acquired 100 of the share capital of visa europe on the third anniversary of the closing we will pay additional purchase consideration of € 1 billion  plus 40  compound annual interest see note 2—acquisition of visa europe   to our consolidated financial statements as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the us dollar against the euro a hypothetical 10  decline in the us dollar against the euro compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2016 would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by 123 million  including interest 

 48 

we are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of visa europe is the euro translation from the euro to the us dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets a hypothetical 10  change in the euro against the us dollar compared to the exchange rate at september 30 2016 could result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 19 billion  in the third quarter we designated our eurodenominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of our net investment in visa europe changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period partially offset the foreign currency translation of the companys net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the companys consolidated balance sheet see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  and note 12—derivative and nonderivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our operating results or cash flows have been nor are they expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2016  and 2015  were 51 billion  and 44 billion  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately 49 million  on our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2016  the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 22 billion  and 17 billion  at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2016  and 2015  our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 11 billion  and 10 billion  respectively and projected benefit obligations were 11 billion  and 10 billion  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10  decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1  decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 254 million  in the funded status and an increase of approximately 40 million  in pension cost 

at september 30 2016  our nonus defined benefit pension plan assets were 415 million  and projected benefit obligations were 474 million  a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10  decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1  decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 127 million  in the funded status and an increase of approximately 9 million  in pension cost 

we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2017  if any which would be made in september 2017

general business developments 

visa inc which we refer to as visa or the company is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast secure and reliable electronic payments we operate one of the worlds most advanced processing networks — visanet —  which facilitates authorization clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide it also offers fraud protection for account holders and rapid payment for merchants visa is not a bank and does not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on visabranded cards and payment products in most cases account holder and merchant relationships belong to and are managed by our financial institution clients 

visa inc was incorporated in the state of delaware in may 2007 in october 2007 we undertook a reorganization in which visa usa inc visa international service association visa canada corporation and inovant llc became direct or indirect subsidiaries of visa inc visa europe limited remains owned and governed by its european member financial institutions and is not a subsidiary of visa inc visa inc completed its initial public offering ipo in march 2008 

general business developments in fiscal 2015 included the following 

   

  5 

   

 

 

on november 2 2015 the company and visa europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire visa europe closing of the acquisition is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016 see note 2—visa europe   to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

nature of operations 

visas mission is to accelerate the electronification of commerce we operate an openloop payments network visanet through which visa connects and manages the exchange of information and value between i issuers —  financial institutions that issue visabranded cards or payment products to account holders and ii acquirers —  financial institutions that contract with merchants to accept visabranded cards or payment products we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visabranded cards or payment products the issuers have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by the account holders 

interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our openloop payments network on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in addition we generally do not earn any revenue from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate the acquirers are typically responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

a typical visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her visabranded card or payment product to a merchant as payment for goods or services the transaction information is then transmitted 

 6 

electronically to the acquirer and routed through visanet to the issuer for authorization following authorization a clearing file containing the final transaction data is submitted from the acquirer and processed for final settlement between the issuer and acquirer the following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction on visanet 

our operating revenues are principally comprised of service revenues data processing revenues and international transaction revenues and are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements the company has one reportable segment payment services 

 

 

 

 us dollar settlements with our financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days resulting in amounts due from and to financial institution clients these amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

 7 

in order to maintain the integrity of and minimize disruptions to our payments network we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations the settlement indemnification applies to the amount of visa payment transactions that have occurred but have not yet settled we maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on our consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in our name all other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets we have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years  

core products and services 

visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders i pay now with debit ii pay ahead with prepaid or iii pay later with credit products visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital ecommerce persontoperson payments and mobile products and services these services facilitate transactions on our network among account holders merchants financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally 

 

 

 our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers visanet is built on a centralized architecture enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide valueadded services including information products such as risk scoring and loyalty applications while the transaction data is being routed through our network 

visas processing services continue to expand to address the needs of participants in the evolving payments ecosystem through such offerings as our merchant gateway and visa debit processing services dps merchant gateway services provided through our cybersource subsidiaries enable gateway routing and other services that make it easier for ecommerce merchants to accept process and reconcile payments manage fraud and safeguard payment security online dps provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of visa debit prepaid and atm payment products these and other services support our issuers and acquirers and their use of our products and promote the growth and security of our payments network 

processing infrastructure 

visanet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers including two data centers in the us that are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy in addition in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement among visa inc visa europe limited and others visa europes processing centers in the united kingdom must maintain interoperability with visas synchronized system intelligent access points around the world complete the visanet global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institution clients worldwide to access our core processing and valueadded services 

visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the us and internationally that enable transaction services and provide uninterrupted connectivity for account holders our financial institution clients and our processing partners 

intellectual property 

our portfolio of trademarks in particular our family of visa marks our plus mark and our dove design mark are important to our business through agreements with our issuers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the us and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

 8 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 accounted for more than 30 of our operating revenues in those years 

working capital 

payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

concentration of business and financial information about geographic areas 

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 13—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment these include 

 based on payments volume total volume and number of transactions visa is the largest retail electronic payments network used throughout the world the following chart compares our network with those of our major competitors for calendar year 2014 



 in the global debit network market segment our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands including star nyce and pulse in the us eftpos in australia nets in singapore and interac in canada in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by mastercard and many of the debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands provide the primary network and our brands are used 

 9 

primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of our overall transaction volume 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change we may face increasing competition from emerging players in the payment space many of which are nonfinancial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional business model the emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on ecommerce andor mobile technologies paypal and alipay are examples these providers compete with us directly in some cases yet may also be significant partners and customers of ours   

we also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients we believe our fundamental value proposition of convenience interoperability accessibility and security offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate we do so by partnering with local financial institutions merchants governments nongovernmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

employees 

at september 30 2015 we employed approximately 11300 persons worldwide we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 

government regulation   

interchange reimbursement fees  we have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the us and many other geographies during fiscal 2012 the federal reserve implemented new rules under the doddfrank act setting a cap on the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for debit products issued by large financial institutions these rules continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of us debit transactions we process and decrease our associated revenues see  item 1a — risk factors — the doddfrank act and other regulations and developments arising from the doddfrank act may continue to harm our overall business  included elsewhere in this report 

certain jurisdictions outside the us also regulate or have the power to regulate debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the reserve bank of australia regulates interchange reimbursement rates and the governing authorities in india regulate the merchant discount rate   in may 2015 the eu published a regulation on interchange fees for cardbased payment transactions and interchange caps for intraregional debit and credit card transactions will take effect on december 9 2015 see item 1a — risk factors — additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may reduce our transaction volumes and harm our overall business  and item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  included elsewhere in this report 

network exclusivity and routing  the doddfrank act limits the issuers and our ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the us debit and prepaid network market segments other jurisdictions have enacted similar limitations 

us consumer financial protection bureau  the doddfrank act created an independent consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent the cfpb’s future actions may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to issuers acquirers consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures payment card practices fees routing and other matters with respect to credit debit and prepaid cards 

nosurcharge rules  we have historically implemented rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using their visabranded card or payment product instead of other means as part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation however visa has agreed to modify our rules to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances see   item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  included elsewhere in this report a number of us states as well as certain jurisdictions outside the us have taken steps to prohibit surcharging following court challenges some of these laws have been invalidated by federal courts in certain states and upheld in others 

 10 

data protection and information security  aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection laws in the us and other jurisdictions globally   in accordance with governing law we devote substantial resources to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and under certain circumstances to provide account holder notification in the event of a security breach in addition the us federal financial institutions examination council periodically reviews aspects of our operations in the us to examine our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirements and standards as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions regulators around the globe are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection due to the evolving nature and handling of data the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws around the globe are often uncertain and in a state of flux 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctioned countries  we are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act and the patriot act in addition we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets controls “ofac” that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals as well as with specificallydesignated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers terrorists and terrorist organizations we have policies procedures systems and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions 

governmentimposed market participation influences and restrictions  our market reach remains limited by certain governments influence on their domestic payments competition andor their protection of domestic issuers or payments network processors regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries 

regulation of internet mobile payment and other types of transactions  many jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations that require payments system participants including our financial institution clients and us to monitor identify filter restrict or take other specific actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions for example us federal legislation has been enacted that requires payment system operators to implement a system that allows issuers to identify internet gambling transactions so they have the option to decline such transaction requests state governments have been interested in the potential blocking of internet interstate sales of cigarettes and alcohol or the collection of state and local sales taxes on such internet purchases implementing such systems increases costs for our financial institution clients and us and may reduce merchant acceptance of visabranded cards and payment products for these purchases 

the us congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on our financial institution clients and us some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including mobile payment transactions money transfer identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients directly these new requirements and developments may affect our financial institution clients ability to offer existing products and services extend credit via payment cards and products and offer new types of payment programs which could decrease our transaction volumes and revenues

 item 1a risk factors 

regulatory risks 

additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may reduce our transaction volumes and harm our overall business  

we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction as those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and overall payments volume 

we have historically set default interchange reimbursement rates in the us and many other geographies interchange reimbursement rates our operating rules and related practices have become subject to continued or increased government regulation globally and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates and practices 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive it may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems like competitors closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers in addition as a result of such regulations we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers in certain instances some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchants not to accept visabranded cards or payment products or to steer account holders to alternate payment systems or forms of payment in addition some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs for these reasons additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may make visabranded cards and payment products less desirable reduce our overall transaction volumes and harm our overall business 

we are subject to regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network  

in order to provide account holders a consistent experience and transparency into visanet we promote certain practices to ensure that visabranded cards are processed over our network we have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only our network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity 

in addition certain network or issuer rules or practices may be viewed as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks coreside on visa debit cards for example the visa rules require that all authorization clearance and settlement of international transactions must be done through visanet these are commonly referred to as routing rules 

the doddfrank act already limits our and issuers ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area additional legislation or regulations like the doddfrank act in the us and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process in order to retain transaction volume we may reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers acquirers or merchants any of these outcomes could harm our overall business 

the doddfrank act and other regulations and developments arising from the doddfrank act may continue to harm our overall business  

as of october 1 2011 in accordance with the doddfrank act the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points with a possible fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to a significant reduction in the average systemwide fees previously charged the federal reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules 

 12 

also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

these regulations have adversely affected our us debit business and associated revenues by creating negative pressure on our pricing reduced the volume and number of us debit payments we process and diminished associated revenues although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the october 2011 regulations our business could continue to be affected including if the federal reserve issues new or revised regulations 

negative pressures have arisen through various channels other debit networks may become more aggressive in offering merchant cost reductions to win routing preference which in turn puts more pressure on the business terms offered by visa a number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue some clients elected to issue fewer cards enabled with visaaffiliated networks or reduced the number of debit cards they issued and investments they made in marketing and rewards programs while others imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer account holders to other debit networks based on lower cost or other factors other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future 

some elements of the doddfrank act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the rules our interpretation may result in a pursuit of strategies that may be less effective than those of our competitors overall the regulations and developments arising from the doddfrank act could harm our overall business 

new laws or regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or of other product offerings  

regulators around the world increasingly note each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another the doddfrank act and the european union interchange regulation are developments with such potential see note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report  similarly new laws and regulations involving one product offering may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example regulations affecting debit payments could eventually spread to credit payments 

the risks created by a new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offerings we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates preferred routing domestic processing requirements currency conversion point of sale transaction rules and practices privacy and data use or protection as a result the visa rules may differ from country to country or by product offering 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services and fees and other important aspects of our business in the various regions in addition adverse developments regulations and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation and result in greater regulatory and legislative scrutiny or litigation against us any of these factors could harm our overall business 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries  

governments in some countries provide resources to or protection for their domestic payment card networks brands and processors these governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country in china for example unionpay continues to enjoy advantages over international networks remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark though the chinese state council has announced that international schemes such as visa would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a bank card clearing institution bcci in china legislation and implementation guidelines for bcci’s have yet to be published and finalized meanwhile in russia national payment legislation has effectively prevented visa from processing in the domestic market and has mandated that visa migrate its domestic processing business to the state owned nspk which is the only entity allowed to process domestically national laws that mandate domestic processing may increase our costs and decrease the number of visabranded cards issued or processed in those regions these actions could impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our financial institution clients in those countries and substantially restrict our activities there and in 

 13 

other countries that may adopt similar practices these actions could also force us to leave countries where we presently have activity and keep us from entering new markets although we are trying to effect change in these countries we may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to operate our business maintain or increase our revenues globally and extend our global brands 

we are subject to regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security  

privacy data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the us and elsewhere for example in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions that have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances and the breadth of these notices these laws and regulations can impact the way we use and handle data operate our products and services and even impact our ability to offer a product or service our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands these laws and regulations may increase visa ’ s and our clients costs decrease the number of visabranded cards our clients issue and decrease our payments volume and revenue 

evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us  

regulation of the payments industry has evolved and increased significantly examples include 

 

 

 

 

 

 14 

 

 

 complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities our programs and policies are designed to comply with antimoney laundering antiterrorism anticorruption and sanctions regulations and other laws and we continue to enhance them but as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our global brand reputation the impact of such regulations on our clients and on us may increase compliance costs and reduce the volume of payments we process moreover such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer the countries in which visabranded cards are used and the types of account holders and merchants who can obtain or accept visabranded cards thereby harming our overall business 

litigation risks 

our us retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments  

our us retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation which is described in note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report the us retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the us covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our ipo and any subsequent offerings of our shares of class a common stock or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings they also include a loss sharing agreement a judgment sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement as amended in addition our us financial institution clients are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to visa usa incs certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique complicated and tiered and if we cannot use one or more of them this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

the principal remaining us covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rates see note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report  beginning in 2005 a series of complaints the majority of which were styled as class actions were filed on behalf of merchants against us mastercard andor other defendants including certain visa member financial institutions we refer to this as the interchange multidistrict litigation or mdl 1720 among other allegations the plaintiffs alleged that visas setting of default interchange reimbursement rates violated federal antitrust laws and in some cases certain state unfair competition laws the lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york 

the plaintiffs in mdl 1720 seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount rates as well as injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that estimated damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages would be trebled 

the allocation of any monetary judgment or certain settlements among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february 7 2011 and amended august 26 2014 and october 22 2015 see note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements 

 15 

included in item   8  of this report visas portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement as amended would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our us retrospective responsibility plan 

we signed settlement agreements in connection with mdl 1720 which included an agreement to pay approximately 40 billion to the class plaintiffs on january 14 2014 the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement from which a number of objectors have appealed until the appeals are finally adjudicated no assurance can be provided that we will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement 

a number of merchants have filed optout cases in various federal district courts all of the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over mdl 1720 or have been transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation for inclusion in mdl 1720 the court has entered an order confirming that mdl 1720 includes i all current and future actions transferred to mdl 1720 by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings and ii all actions filed in the eastern district of new york that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in mdl 1720 or that are brought after october 22 2015 by an opt out of the rule 23b3 settlement class in mdl 1720 and arise out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in mdl 1720 are us covered litigation for purposes of the us retrospective responsibility plan see note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  

failure of our us retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent the us retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the us covered litigation the plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our ipo that are transferred to or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation or that are brought by a rule 23b3 opt out and arise out of facts or circumstances substantially similar to those alleged in mdl 1720 in addition nonmonetary settlement terms and judgments in the us covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business therefore even if our us retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of and judgments in the us covered litigation it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation 

as described in note 2—visa europe   and   note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities   to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report on november 2 2015 the company and visa europe entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire visa europe the closing is subject to various conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016 visa inc visa europe or their affiliates are or may become a party to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the visa europe territory as part of the acquisition terms the company has obtained certain protection in respect of losses resulting from such existing and potential litigation through the preferred stock and the uk loss sharing agreement if claims are not covered by these transactional protections visa europe may have recourse under its membership documents against members under the terms of the existing indemnity arrangements other than in respect of certain claims relating to uk domestic multilateral interchange fees however similar to the us retrospective responsibility plan failure of these protections to insulate us adequately from the impact of settlements or judgments in the existing and potential litigation against visa inc visa europe or their affiliates could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 

if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages  

like many other large companies we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competition or antitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others examples of such claims are described more fully in note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability accordingly we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings 

particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us due to the size and scope of our business if we are unsuccessful in our defense against a large class action lawsuit such as the us or canadian merchant class action lawsuits monetary damages could be 

 16 

significant which could harm our financial condition see note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

there may be limitations on our business or changes to our business practices resulting from our litigation  

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation we may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation for example under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation we have agreed among other things to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions in certain circumstances see   item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  included elsewhere in this report additional surcharges to credit transactions could adversely impact consumers usage of visabranded payment products 

settlements of or judgments in pending and future litigation could force us to limit the rates we set revise our rules about rates charged to consumers who use visabranded payment products or make other modifications that could harm our overall business 

we may be subject to tax examinations or disputes or changes in the tax laws  

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

we have limited rights to enforce our framework agreement with visa europe which could expose us to significant liabilities  

while we have entered into an agreement to acquire visa europe until the transaction closes or if it fails to close our relationship is governed by the framework agreement in the event visa europe fails to meet its obligations under the framework agreement our remedies are limited we are unable to terminate the framework agreement even upon visa europes material uncured breach see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

under the framework agreement we may be required to indemnify visa europe for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their actions relating to the payments business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents engaged in the actions gives rise to such claims the indemnity obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control our us retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities 

in our view pursuant to the framework agreement visa europe is obligated to indemnify visa inc and visa international service association visa international in connection with the european competition proceedings ie the pending european commission investigation and the filed or unfiled claims in the uk merchant litigation including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed however visa europe has informed us of its view that it is not obligated to indemnify visa inc or visa international for these claims if visa europe continues in its refusal to indemnify us and we cannot enforce the indemnity we could be exposed to significant liabilities which would not be covered under our us retrospective responsibility plan see note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

business risks 

we face intense pressures on client pricing  

pressure on client pricing poses challenges for our business in order to stay competitive we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand their visabranded card base these include upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments we have continued to increase the use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the us in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to 

 17 

win routing preference in situations where our products coreside with other networks and merchants have a choice of network routing options the economic pressures on our clients arising from the doddfrank act have also increased our use of incentives as a result the provision of certain products and services may be less profitable or become unprofitable which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 

if we continue to increase incentives to our clients we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing the amount of feebased services we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from longterm contracts with certain clients including those that are large contributors to our revenue continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from maintaining such agreements in the future on the same or favorable terms we may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations while we may implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives we may not be successful in our efforts or they may not offset the decreases in our revenues 

we face intense competition in our industry  

the global payments industry is intensely competitive and as a result our payment programs compete against all forms of payment these include cash checks electronic ecommerce virtual currencies and mobile payments as well as traditional general purpose card networks in addition our openloop payments network competes against other alternate payment systems such as closedloop payment systems traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete 

our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services the doddfrank act increased this competitive pressure the risk to maintaining or securing our clients longterm commitments to our products increased with the doddfrank acts restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector we do not have exclusivity with our largest clients such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstances our clients may terminate these relationships on relatively short notice without significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients the loss of business from any of these clients could have an adverse effect on the company see note 13—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

additionally some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology or have greater financial resources they may offer a wider range of programs products and services than we do including more innovative ones they may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other developments in many cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions 

we expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future for example 

 

 

 

 

 18 

 

 

 our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth 

disintermediation from the payments value chain could harm our business  

our position in the payments value chain is key to our business some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks virtual currencies and certain alternate payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without any intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model regulatory actions or initiatives such as the doddfrank act or the federal reserve’s faster payments efforts   may provide them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although other competitors are pursuing similar lines of business or adopting similar commercial models they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies including mobile payments and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers 

additional consolidation in the financial services industry could impact our revenues and harm our overall business  

additional consolidation in the financial services industry or the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors may reduce the overall number of our clients this could result in the acquired financial institutions visa business shifting to a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business to us 

our existing clients may seek to obtain more favorable pricing agreements we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volumebased discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could impact our revenues and harm our overall business 

merchants continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance exposes us to additional risks  

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visabranded payment cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuits if they continue we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses 

additionally some merchants have pushed for changes to the visa rules which govern visa acceptance at the point of sale including the ability to accept only certain types of visabranded cards eg credit or debit and impose account holder surcharges if successful where applicable these efforts could adversely impact consumers usage of visabranded payment products 

we also face competitive pressures on pricing we and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of visabranded payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain large merchants some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions using both 

 19 

traditional and new technology platforms   examples include closedloop payment systems   that are specific to a single merchant   or multimerchant solutions like the merchant customer exchange which is designed for a mobile platform utilizing alternative payment systems and has many merchant participants   such programs may offer unique or specialized benefits to consumers including discounts or customized offers   if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could harm our business 

we may not be able to grow or maintain our business due to certain financial institutions or merchants exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors  

certain financial institutions or merchants have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue or accept payment cards these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in addition these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from growing our business 

our success depends on our relationships with our financial institution clients acquirers merchants account holders and other third parties  

we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support and to compete effectively for our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these competitive card features for their customers account holders however may associate these features with our brands and if they are dissatisfied our business may be harmed 

as a result of the doddfrank acts network exclusivity regulations we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants acquirers and processors to provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we already engage in many cobranding efforts in which we contract with merchants who directly receive incentives from us as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships 

outside the us some governments only permit local providers to complete domestic processing which prohibits us from overseeing the endtoend processing of the transactions therefore we depend on our close working relationships with our clients or other third party processors in these regions to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving visabranded cards our inability to oversee the endtoend processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands 

in addition we depend on third parties and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and to the extent that such thirdparty vendors or our financial institution clients fail to perform or deliver adequate services our business and reputation could be impaired 

negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation  

our brands and reputation are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain account holders and financial institution clients to visabranded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industrys quality of service use and protection of account holder data regulatory compliance financial condition corporate responsibility and other factors negative perception or publicity particularly in light of the rapid widespread use of social media channels could cause damage to our brands and reputation our business may also be affected by actions taken by our clients or other third parties or by circumstances that are outside of our control 

 

 

 20 

 any of these factors could turn clients and consumers away from our brand and products require us to take on additional liabilities and costs result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny and harm our overall business 

we may continue to be affected by economic events in financial markets around the world  

the current threats to global economic growth include geopolitical instability in brazil venezuela russia ukraine the middle east and other oil producing countries which could affect oil prices economic fragility in the eurozone and in the us higher interest rates hurting the housing market sluggish job creation political discord spending cuts and debt defaults while there continues to be some improvements in advanced economies emerging economies continue to suffer with slower growth consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt levels elevated housing inventory deflation changes in savings rates continued equity market volatility decreased export activity lowered government spending and additional government intervention furthermore continued challenges in the credit environment bank instability downgrades of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issues affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policies could also impact our clients merchants and account holders 

the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments or crises were to arise around the world these include defaults on government debt exhaustion of national economic stimulus packages significant increases in oil prices tax increases a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps most recently the economic situations in various countries in europe have been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of debt defaults if such defaults occur or if the measures taken to avert such defaults create their own instability economic turmoil is likely to result and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant 

the volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economies and the responses by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones these include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

  21 

 

 any of these developments could harm our overall business 

a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and in multicurrency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability  

 

 

 transactions outside the us represent an increasingly important part of our strategy which we hope will continue to grow however a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and multicurrency transactions would decrease the number of crossborder transactions we process and our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected as a consequence 

we risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications  

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the visa rules in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement while the amount of our indemnification obligations has no limit our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time 

concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources and impact our liquidity even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and harm our business see note 11—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

some of our clients are considered group members under the visa rules as a result some of these group members have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent 

 22 

financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could impact our liquidity 

the use of our products and our revenues could decline if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services or comply with new laws and regulations  

rapid significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry these include developments in mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance ecommerce tokenization cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including some potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industrywide standards new laws and regulations resistance to change from clients or merchants or third parties intellectual property rights if we are unable to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards it could reduce the use of our products and harm our business 

the perception of our brands and our business could be harmed if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or compromised  

processing or other technology malfunctions fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in longdistance or local telecommunications access fraud military or political conflicts terrorism effects of climate change or other catastrophic events may disrupt or compromise our transaction processing systems in addition we may be susceptible to physical or computerbased attacks by terrorists or hackers due to our role in the global payments industry these concerns about security are increased when information is transmitted over the internet and new technologies are used to conduct financial transactions threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denialofservice attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties equipment and data they could also compromise data security if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded   finally potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks 

additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require for similar reasons the failure could interrupt our services because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and harm our business 

we may encounter account data breaches cyberattacks or system failures involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third parties or by us  

we our clients merchants and other service providers process store or transmit account holder and other information in connection with visabranded cards and payment products in addition our clients may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands the security measures and procedures we our clients merchants and other service providers have in place to protect sensitive account holder data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches cyberattacks or system failures   defending against even unsuccessful attempts to access our systems could materially increase our costs 

a failure or breach of the systems processing storing or transmitting sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visabranded cards reputational damage claims against us and loss of clients if we are sued in any lawsuit in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could harm our business in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach cyberattacks or system failure at one or more of our clients merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of visabranded cards which could harm our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally a breach may also subject visa to additional regulations or 

 23 

governmental or regulatory investigations which could result in significant compliance costs fines or enforcement actions against the company or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions 

fraudulent or other illegal activity involving visabranded cards or payment products could harm our business  

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture account holder and other information they use this information to conduct fraudulent transactions involving our payment products outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing as a result more third parties are involved in processing transactions using visabranded cards or payment products a rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving visabranded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands this could reduce the use and acceptance of visabranded cards and payment products or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs lower our payments volume and harm our overall business 

failure to maintain interoperability with visa europes systems could damage the business and global perception of the visa brands  

until our proposed acquisition of visa europe closes and for a period of time afterwards while visa europes systems are being integrated with visas systems visa and visa europe will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement systems as a result we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories regardless of where it originates visa europes independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to increasing costs and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between visa europe and us could negatively affect account holders from visa europe using payment products in the countries we serve or our account holders using payment products in visa europes region failure to authorize clear and settle interterritory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands 

structural and organizational risks 

we may experience added costs and challenges in operating our business in certain territories due to our relationship with visa europe  

until our proposed acquisition of visa europe closes visa europes exclusive license of our trademarks and technologies under the framework agreement gives us little ability to control and oversee visa europes operations in its region if we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that may be viewed as unfavorable to visa europe and its members visa europe is not required to implement the changes unless we agree to pay for the associated implementation costs this may result in added costs and expenses to our business furthermore the licenses granted under the framework agreement may raise licensing payment and associated tax treatment concerns 

until our proposed acquisition of visa europe closes visa europe may hinder our ability to acquire new businesses or to operate them effectively in its region if the acquired business has operations in visa europes region visa europe may play a significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decisions and costs there finally visa europe may undertake operational and litigation strategies including but not limited to our ongoing litigation in the uk and our ongoing case with the european commission that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally 

we may be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly global dynamic competitive economic and regulatory environment  

for us to remain organizationally effective we must effectively empower and deploy our management and operational resources and incorporate both global and local perspectives into our decisions and processes if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand quickly and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory 

in addition if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks execute our strategy and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed we may not be successful in this increasingly global dynamic competitive economic and regulatory environment 

 24 

we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees  

our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract motivate and retain highly qualified employees or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could adversely affect our business and our future success 

future sales of our class a common stock or the end of transfer restrictions on our class b common stock could result in dilution to holders of our existing class a common stock  

the market price of our class a common stock could fall as a result of many factors under our us retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our us covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock future offerings of our class a common stock or the end of the transfer restrictions on our class b common stock would increase the number of class a common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price and dilute the voting power of our existing class   a common stock likewise if we complete the proposed acquisition of visa europe and issue the preferred shares similar impacts on market price and dilution to our existing class a common stock could occur upon conversion of the preferred shares into class a common shares the market price of our class   a common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase in the number of class a common stock outstanding could occur in the future 

if funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our us retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class a common stock will be diluted  

under our us retrospective responsibility plan funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all us covered litigation will be released back to us at that time each share of class   b common stock will become convertible into shares of class a common stock benefiting the holders of class   b common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holders of class   a common stock the amount of funds released and the market price of our class a common stock will determine the extent of the dilution 

holders of our class b and c common stock may have different interests than our holders of our class a common stock concerning certain significant transactions  

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock can vote on certain significant transactions these include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law the holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with holders of class a common stock likewise if we complete the proposed acquisition of visa europe and issue the preferred shares a similar dynamic may occur with the holders of the preferred shares 

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control  

provisions contained in our current certificate of incorporation in our current bylaws and under delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable for instance except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance in addition except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to visa members as defined in our current certificate of incorporation no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis 

we may not be able to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future  

since august 2008 we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class a b and c common stock the payment of dividends if any is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including but not limited to our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant if as a result of these factors we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to pay dividends to all of our stockholders specifically if a dividend is declared or paid an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock and on the preferred shares we are obligated to issue if we complete our proposed acquisition of visa europe

acquisitions strategic investments and entries into new businesses could disrupt our business  

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses products or technologies we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them such transactions including our anticipated acquisition of visa europe would present significant challenges and risks in cases where strategic acquisitions or investments are not successfully implemented or completed our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted we may incur substantial debt for strategic acquisitions or investments which could adversely impact our credit ratings   achieving the benefits of an acquisition is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business and systems into our existing operations successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business and achieving expected synergies any of which we may be unable to achieve on a timely basis or at all 

until our acquisition of visa europe is completed we are subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in visa europes territory which impacts our ability to expand or conduct business in those regions regulatory constraints particularly competition regulations may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisitions or investments acquisitions outside the us may present unique challenges or increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations including foreign currency risks and the risks of complying with foreign regulations 

furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resources from our core business and may disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenues although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that they will be successful 

with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisitions or through organic development these include digital ecommerce loyalty services and mobile payments our recent entry into these businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our proposed acquisition of visa europe 

we may not be able to complete the acquisition of visa europe on the terms currently contemplated or at all  

on november 2 2015 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire visa europe ltd we and visa europe have agreed to use all reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to complete the acquisition there is no assurance however that the acquisition will ultimately be completed as the obligations of the parties to complete the acquisition are subject to various conditions these conditions include among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the acquisition agreement may be terminated by us or visa europe subject to specified exceptions if the acquisition is not completed by august 2 2016 or if legal restraints that prohibit the closing have become final and nonappealable 

 26 

if we fail to complete the acquisition visa europe would continue to have the right to require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from visa europe’s members under the terms of the put option as it existed prior to its amendment in connection with the proposed acquisition given current economic conditions the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of 15 billion we may not have the resources to fund the purchase price particularly if the reason we failed to complete the acquisition was due to our inability to raise debt financing 

financing the acquisition of visa europe exposes us to risk  

to finance the visa europe acquisition we expect to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between 15 and 16 billion in the first half of fiscal 2016 with maturities ranging between two and 30 years depending on market conditions we cannot predict whether we will be able to issue this debt on favorable terms in this timeframe or at all if we are unable to issue this debt on favorable terms the cost to us of financing the acquisition may be higher than we currently expect 

moreover although we currently anticipate that the issuance of this debt will not adversely impact our credit ratings there can be no assurance that one or more credit rating agencies will not lower our credit ratings particularly if there is a perceived deterioration in our business or financial prospects any lowering of our credit ratings before or in connection with the issuance of this debt would be expected to increase the cost of financing the acquisition 

if we are unable to issue this debt and are not able to obtain alternative financing on terms that are acceptable to us we may be unable to complete the acquisition which could expose us to liability to visa europe and its shareholders 

if we issue this debt but then fail to complete the acquisition we will nevertheless incur interest expense which may be higher than any returns we are able to achieve through investing the proceeds in our business or otherwise in addition we may be obliged to redeem this debt at a redemption price that exceeds the net proceeds to us from its initial issuance 

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the visa europe acquisition  

even if we complete the visa europe acquisition a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits to us from the acquisition for example 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  27 

 

if we do not successfully implement the visa europe acquisition or the acquisition is not completed on the terms we currently contemplate our financial condition results of operations and prospects could be negatively impacted in particular although we currently expect the visa europe acquisition to be mildly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2017 before onetime integration costs if the expenses associated with integrating visa europe into our operations and financing the acquisition are higher than we currently contemplate if we fail to achieve our revenue expectations due to unexpected customer losses or otherwise or if we do not achieve the benefits we anticipate from revenue synergies cost savings and increased repurchases of class a common stock we may not achieve this goal

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast secure and reliable electronic payments we provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of visabranded payment products including credit debit and prepaid we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions merchants consumers businesses and government entities each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic forms of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities particularly outside the united states we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide 

overall economic conditions  our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal 2015 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth 

visa europe acquisition  on november 2 2015 we entered into a transaction agreement with visa europe pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100 of the share capital of visa europe for a total purchase price of up to €212 billion the purchase price consists of a at the closing of the transaction upfront cash consideration of €115 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class a common stock or class a equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately €50 billion and b following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters postclosing contingent cash consideration of up to €40 billion plus up to an additional €07 billion in interest determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such postclosing period in conjunction with the transaction agreement the visa europe put option was amended to align the terms on which visa europe may exercise its rights under the put option agreement with the terms of the transaction agreement the purchase of visa europes share capital will be effected through the exercise of the amended visa europe put option the preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities if any which may be incurred by us visa europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the visa europe territory as part of the acquisition we also entered into the uk loss sharing agreement with visa europe and certain of visa europe’s members located in the united kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or visa europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the united kingdom see note 2—visa europe  note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements the closing of our acquisition of visa europe is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and is currently expected to occur in our fiscal third quarter of 2016 

financial highlights during fiscal 2015 we recorded net income of 63 billion or diluted class a earnings per share of 258 an increase of 16 and 20 over the prior year respectively our nongaap adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 are as follows 



  33 

 during fiscal 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of 296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities of the 296 million benefit 239 million relates to prior fiscal years our financial results for the year ended september 30 2014 reflect a onetime tax benefit of 191 million associated with a deduction for us domestic production activities related to fiscal years 2013 and prior see note 19—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

we recorded net operating revenues of 139 billion for fiscal 2015 an increase of 9 over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume processed transactions and crossborder volume the general strengthening of the us dollar during the year resulted in a twoandahalf percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth 

total operating expenses for fiscal 2015 were 48 billion a decrease of 4 over the prior year primarily due to the absence of a 450 million litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation recorded in fiscal 2014 excluding this provision operating expenses increased by 6 over prior year adjusted operating expenses primarily due to increases in personnel additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure and general and administrative expenses the increases were partially offset by decreases in network and processing and marketing expenses 

adjusted financial results our financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years as they either have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan as such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 

 the following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 there were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013

 class a common stock split  in january 2015 visa’s board of directors declared a fourforone split of its class a common stock each class a common stockholder of record at the close of business on february 13 2015 record date received a dividend of three additional shares on march 18 2015 for every share held as of the record date trading began on a splitadjusted basis on march 19 2015 holders of class b and c common stock did not receive a stock dividend instead the conversion rate for class b common stock increased to 16483 shares of class a common stock per share of class b common stock and the conversion rate for class c common stock increased to 40 shares of class a common stock per share of class c common stock immediately following the split the class a b and c stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split see note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

reduction in asconverted class a common stock  during fiscal 2015  we repurchased 44 million  shares of our class a common stock in the open market using 29 billion  of cash on hand as of september 30 2015  we had remaining authorized funds of 28 billion  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2014 have been completed in october 2015  our board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion   share repurchase program see note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues nominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the united states driven mainly by consumer credit nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the us dollar on a constantdollar basis which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended june 30 2015 1  was 13  compared to 15  for the prior year comparable period processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency

 the following table provides the number of transactions processed by our visanet system including transactions involving visa visa electron interlink and plus cards processed on visas networks during the fiscal periods presented 1   

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visabranded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services as well as the number of transactions processed on our network we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visabranded cards or payment products our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues  consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of visabranded payment products and solutions current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with visa europe data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered 

international transaction revenues  are earned for crossborder transaction processing and currency conversion activities crossborder transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant international transaction revenues are primarily generated by crossborder payments and cash volume 

other revenues  consist mainly of license fees for use of the visa brand revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement fees from account holder services certification and licensing and other activities related to our acquired entities other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended account holder protection and concierge services   

 37 

client incentives consist of longterm contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visabranded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel includes salaries employee benefits incentive compensation sharebased compensation and contractor expense 

marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions of the visa brand 

network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

professional fees  mainly consist of fees for legal consulting and other professional services 

depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software also included in this amount is amortization of finitelived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions 

general and administrative  mainly consists of facilities costs travel activities foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business 

litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile the specifics of the cases advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date 

nonoperating expense income 

nonoperating expense income mainly includes the change in the fair value of the visa europe put option income gains and losses earned on investments and accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions 

visa inc fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the united states internationally and from visa europe revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements 



 the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume these benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 combined with higher foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues 

 38 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues international transaction revenues and client incentives are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars the effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2015 as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in an overall decline of about twoandahalf percentage points in total operating revenue growth 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues 

  

  39 

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses 



  40 

 nonoperating expense income 

nonoperating expense in fiscal 2015  primarily reflects a noncash adjustment to the fair value of the unamended visa europe put option of 110 million which is not subject to tax the change in value did not reflect any change in the likelihood that visa europe would exercise its option in its unamended form at september 30 2015 see note 2—visa europe   and   note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements nonoperating income in fiscal 2014  increased from fiscal 2013 primarily due to the absence of a 15 million otherthantemporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013 see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rates were 30  in fiscal 2015  and 2014  the following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year 

 the effective income tax rate of 30  in fiscal 2014  differs from the effective income tax rate of 31  in fiscal 2013  mainly due to 

 liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

 41 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 

  

operating activiti es reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation including 

 the cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 

absent the above impacts cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 to approximately 69 billion 65 billion and 59 billion respectively reflecting growth in total operating revenues in all three years see note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities was greater during fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of availableforsale securities and an increase in purchases of availableforsale securities cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 reflecting a decrease in purchases of availableforsale investment securities offset by an increase in cash used to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  and note 7—intangible assets and goodwill  to our consolidated financial statements 

financing activities reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the us retrospective responsibility plan additionally reported financing activities in fiscal 2014 include deposits into the litigation escrow account of 450 million absent these impacts which are related to the interchange multidistrict litigation cash used in financing activities was 40 billion 50 billion and 61 billion in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the changes in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to the repurchase of class a common stock in the open market see note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  note 14—stockholders equity  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide we believe that cash flow generated from operations in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

 42 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled 70 billion  at september 30 2015  if it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the united states we would be required to pay us taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the united states as such we have not accrued a us income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately 64 billion  of undistributed earnings included in these funds the amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable 

availableforsale investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 34 billion  are classified as noncurrent as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however these investments are generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment see item 1a—risk factors  included elsewhere in this report 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30 2015  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

credit facility on january 28 2015  we entered into an unsecured 30 billion  revolving credit facility the credit facility which expires on january 27 2016  replaced our previous 30 billion  credit facility which terminated on january 28 2015  the new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type there were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended september 30 2015  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

universal shelf registration statement in july 2015 we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions this registration statement expires in july 2018 

expected debt issuance and change in capital structure in conjunction with the potential visa europe acquisition we intend to evolve our longterm capital structure we intend to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between 150 billion and 160 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2016 with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years depending on market conditions the proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to fund the upfront cash consideration of the acquisition and increase the repurchase of class a common stock outstanding in 2016 and 2017 to offset the effect of the expected issuance of preferred stock upon the closing of the acquisition our initial leverage is expected to be between 14 and 15 times gross debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda we expect our longterm leverage to be between 11 and 15 times gross debt to ebitda maintaining flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities we expect to maintain our current investment credit ratings disclosed below 

litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the us retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation will be payable when we fund the litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2015  was 11 billion  and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the us covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

 43 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2015  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlement in currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions during fiscal 2015  we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital our average daily net settlement position was a payable of 272 million 

visa europe acquisition  on november 2 2015 we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire visa europe for a total purchase price of up to € 212 billion the purchase price consists of a at the closing of the transaction upfront cash consideration of €115 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class a common stock or class a equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately €50 billion and b following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters postclosing contingent cash consideration of up to €40 billion plus up to an additional €07 billion in interest determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such postclosing period closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016 see note 2—visa europe   to our consolidated financial statements  

we also signed an option amendment which amended the terms of the visa europe put option agreement to reflect the terms of the transaction agreement if the acquisition of visa europe as described above is not completed the put option will revert to its original unamended form the unamended put option agreement if exercised would require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members if the acquisition does not close and the put option reverts to its unamended terms visa europe may exercise the unamended put option at any time thereafter the unamended put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies visa incs forward pricetoearnings multiple as defined in the unamended option agreement or the pe ratio at the time the unamended option is exercised to visa europes adjusted net income for the forward 12month period as defined in the unamended option agreement or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items upon exercise under the unamended terms the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income would be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 

the fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of visa europes option under its unamended terms which under certain conditions could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value at september 30 2015 we determined the fair value of the unamended put option liability to be approximately 255 million while this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at september 30 2015 it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised under its unamended terms the purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation given current economic conditions the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of 15 billion we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things visa europes adjusted sustainable income and our pe ratio in each case as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 

 44 

given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purposes only a range of pe ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates 500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the 500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september 30 2015  or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise its put option in its unamended form we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a forprofit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and as a result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated pe ratios for each 100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed 500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september 30 2015  our estimated longterm pe ratio was 213 x and the longterm pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe was 15 x at september 30 2015  the spot pe ratio was 232 x and the spot pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe was 18 x these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future in its unamended form 



 us covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the us covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the us covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account during fiscal 2015  we made 426 million  in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with the individual optout merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings at september 30 2015  the litigation escrow account had an available balance of 11 billion  see note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities   and   note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the us covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs 

reduction in asconverted class a common stock  during fiscal 2015  we repurchased 44 million  shares of our class a common stock in the open market using 29 billion  of cash on hand as of september 30 2015  we had remaining authorized funds of 28 billion  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2014  have been completed in october 2015  our board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion  share repurchase program see note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

dividends  during fiscal 2015  we paid 12 billion  in dividends in october 2015  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 014  per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 341 million  in connection with this dividend on december 1 2015  see note 14—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by the board of directors holders of class b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service age and eligible compensation we also 

 45 

sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 19 million  14 million  and 4 million  respectively in fiscal 2016  given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately 12 million  the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences see note 10—pension postretirement and other benefits  to our consolidated financial statements 

capital expenditures  our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2015  reflecting the investments to upgrade our processing network during the fourth quarter of 2014 we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives 

acquisitions during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  we acquired businesses in which we previously held a minority interest using 93 million and 134 million of cash on hand respectively these amounts primarily reflect the respective purchase price less cash received these acquisitions help to expand our loyalty solutions for merchants by strengthening our merchant offers capabilities and extend our processing capabilities internationally see note 7—intangible assets and goodwill   to our consolidated financial statements 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2015  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 93 billion  of assets and 268 million  of liabilities of these instruments 262 million  had significant unobservable inputs including the unamended visa europe put option liability of 255 million  and 7 million  of auction rate securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

indemnifications 

we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see   note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 11—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2015 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities

 critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visabranded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language eg early termination clauses managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customerreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2015  client incentives represented 17  of gross operating revenues 

fair value — visa europe put option 

critical estimates on november 2 2015 the visa europe put option was amended in conjunction with our agreement to acquire visa europe at september 30 2015 the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms if the acquisition of visa europe described in note 2—visa europe  is not completed the put option will revert to its original unamended form if the put option is exercised under its unamended terms we will be required to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members the unamended put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies our forward pricetoearnings multiple as defined in the unamended option agreement or the pe ratio at the time the option is exercised to visa europes projected adjusted net income for the forward 12month period as defined in the unamended option agreement or the adjusted sustainable income 

 48 

the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 

upon exercise of the unamended put option the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income would be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the unamended put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the unamended agreement 

the fair value of visa europes unamended option was estimated to be approximately 255 million  at september 30 2015  while the unamended put option is in fact nontransferable this amount recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a thirdparty market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the terms of the unamended put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a thirdparty market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option in its unamended form 

while this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at september 30 2015  it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised given current economic conditions the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of 15 billion see the liquidity and capital resources section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 

assumptions and judgment the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the unamended put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form and the estimated differential between the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock as defined in the unamended put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to as the pe differential 

probability of exercise— exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe including under its articles of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended terms of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including but not limited to i visa europes stated intentions if any to exercise the put option in its unamended form ii evaluation of market conditions including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iii other qualitative factors including but not limited to qualitative factors related to visa europes largest members which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

pe differential— the pe differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward pricetoearnings multiples applicable to our common stock as defined in the unamended put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purposes the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors quantitatively we estimate our pe ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months the “longterm pe calculation” and the last 30 trading dates the “30day pe calculation” prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our longterm pricetoearnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30day pe calculation as compared to the longterm pe calculation in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences if any are the result of a fundamental change in our longterm value or the result of shortterm market volatility or other noncompany specific market factors that may not be indicative of our longterm forward pe we believe given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option that a market participant would more heavily weigh longterm value indicators as opposed to shortterm indicators 

factors that might indicate a fundamental change in longterm value include but are not limited to changes in the regulatory environment client portfolios longterm growth rates or new product innovations a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward pricetoearnings 

 49 

multiple applicable to visa europe these estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies 

other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income growth rates assumed in the valuation reflect a forprofit model as we believe it is likely that should visa europe choose to exercise the put option in its unamended form it will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a forprofit business model in advance of exercising the unamended put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europes results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the unamended put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at september 30 2015  we have assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated longterm pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 15 x the use of a probability of exercise that is 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 37 million  in the value of the unamended put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 249 million  in the value of the unamended put option the unamended put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe as such the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2015  classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months at september 30 2015  

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our us retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the us covered litigation the plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the us covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we did not record an accrual for the us covered litigation during fiscal 2015 see note 3—us retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liabilities  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 20—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by 

 50 

the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the us dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the us dollar value of payments in foreign currencies primarily for expenses at our nonus locations we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated nonus dollar denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 12 billion  and 13 billion  at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2015  is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10  change in the value of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately 91 million  on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2015  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 12—derivative financial instruments   to our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our operating results or cash flows have been nor are expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2015  and 2014  were 44 billion  and 30 billion  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately 48 million  on our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2015  the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 17 billion  and 19 billion  at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively 

visa europe put option 

we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september 30 2015  based on its unamended terms we are required to assess the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as necessary in the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at september 30 2015  we assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 15 x the use of a probability of exercise 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 37 million  in the value of the unamended put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 249 

 51 

million  in the value of the unamended put option see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2015  and 2014  our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 10 billion  and 11 billion  respectively and projected benefit obligations were 10 billion  and 983 million  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding a hypothetical 10  decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1  decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 248 million  in the funded status and an increase of approximately 30 million  in pension cost we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2016  if any which would be made in september 2016

 nature of operations 

visas mission is to accelerate the electronification of commerce we operate an openloop payments network visanet through which visa connects and manages the exchange of information and value between i issuers —  financial institutions that issue visabranded cards or payment products to account holders and ii acquirers —  financial institutions that contract with merchants to accept visabranded cards or payment products we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visabranded cards or payment products the issuers have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by the account holders 

 5 

interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our openloop payments network on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in addition we generally do not earn any revenue from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate the acquirers are typically responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

a typical visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her visabranded card or payment product to a merchant as payment for goods or services the transaction information is then transmitted electronically to the acquirer and routed through visanet to the issuer for authorization following authorization a clearing file containing the final transaction data is submitted from the acquirer and processed for final settlement between the issuer and acquirer the following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction on visanet 

our operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues data processing revenues and international transaction revenues and are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements the company has one reportable segment payment services 

 

 

 

  6 

and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

us dollar settlements with our financial institution clients are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days resulting in amounts due from and to financial institution clients these amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

in order to maintain the integrity of and minimize disruptions to our payments network we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations the settlement indemnification applies to the amount of visa payment transactions that have occurred but have not yet settled we maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on our consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in our name all other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets we have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years  

core products and services 

visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders i pay now with debit ii pay ahead with prepaid or iii pay later with credit products visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital ecommerce and mobile products and services these services facilitate transactions on our network among account holders merchants financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally 

 

 

 our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers visanet is built on a centralized architecture enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide valueadded services including information products such as risk scoring and loyalty applications while the transaction data is being routed through our network 

visas processing services continue to expand to address the needs of all participants in the evolving payments ecosystem through such offerings as our merchant gateway and visa debit processing services dps merchant gateway services provided through our cybersource subsidiaries enable gateway routing and other services that make it easier for ecommerce merchants to accept process and reconcile payments manage fraud and safeguard payment security online dps provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of visa debit prepaid and atm payment products these and other services support our financial institution clients and their use of our products and promote the growth and security of our payments network 

processing infrastructure 

visanet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers including two data centers in the united states which are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy in addition in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement among visa inc visa europe limited and others visa europes processing centers in the united kingdom must maintain interoperability with visas synchronized system intelligent access points around the world complete the visanet global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and valueadded services 

 7 

visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the united states and internationally including those we added with our acquisitions of cybersource and playspan these facilities enable transaction services and provide uninterrupted connectivity for account holders our financial institution clients and our processing partners 

intellectual property 

our portfolio of trademarks in particular our family of visa marks our plus mark and our dove design mark are important to our business through agreements with our financial institution clients we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 accounted for more than 30 of our operating revenues in those years 

working capital 

payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

concentration of business and financial information about geographic areas 

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 13—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment these include 

 based on payments volume total volume and number of transactions visa is the largest retail electronic payments network widely used throughout the world the following chart compares our network with those of our major general purpose payments network competitors for calendar year 2013 



  8 

 in the global debit network market segment our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands including star nyce and pulse in the united states eftpos in australia nets in singapore and interac in canada in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by mastercard and many of the debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands provide the primary network and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of our overall transaction volume 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change we may face increasing competition from emerging players in the payment space many of which are nonfinancial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional business model the emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on ecommerce andor mobile technologies paypal and alipay are examples these providers compete with us directly in some cases yet may also be significant partners and customers of ours   

we also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients we believe our fundamental value proposition of convenience interoperability accessibility and security offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate we do so by partnering with local financial institutions merchants governments nongovernmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

employees 

at september 30 2014 we employed approximately 9500 persons worldwide we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 

government regulation 

interchange reimbursement fees  we have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the united states and many other geographies during fiscal 2012 the federal reserve implemented new rules under the doddfrank act setting a cap on the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for debit products issued by large financial institutions these rules continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of us debit transactions we process and decrease our associated revenues as a result we have significantly modified our debit strategy and continue to renegotiate some portions of our contracts with our financial institution clients in july 2013 a federal court invalidated the newly implemented rules finding that the federal reserve improperly considered certain costs in setting a cap on the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate and that issuers must make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing each electronic debit transaction regardless of authorization method on march 21 2014 the court of appeals for the dc circuit reversed the district courts ruling and agreed with the federal reserve except for a single issue related to the interchange cost calculation which was referred back to the federal reserve for reconsideration on august 18 2014 the plaintiff merchants filed a petition for review of the appeals courts decision in the us supreme court seeking review of a portion of the rules pertaining to the interchange cost calculation the current rules remain in place while the case is ongoing see  item 1a — risk factors — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  and item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview  included elsewhere in this report 

certain jurisdictions outside the united states also regulate debit and credit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the reserve bank of australia regulates interchange reimbursement rates in some jurisdictions such as india the governing authorities have begun to regulate other rates or practices such as the 

 9 

merchant discount rate see item 1a — risk factors — additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  and item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  included elsewhere in this report 

network exclusivity and routing  we have historically had agreements under which issuers received incentives if they agreed to issue visabranded cards or payment products that are processed through visanet historically issuers of some debit products outside the united states have chosen to include only our network these various practices are referred to as network exclusivity the doddfrank act limits the issuers and our ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the us debit network market segment other jurisdictions have enacted similar limitations see  item 1a — risk factors — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  included elsewhere in this report 

us consumer financial protection bureau  the doddfrank act created an independent consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent the cfpb’s future actions may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to issuers acquirers consumers and merchants 

nosurcharge rules  we have historically implemented rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using their visabranded card or payment product instead of other means as part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation however visa has agreed to modify our rules to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances see   item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  included elsewhere in this report ten us states as well as certain jurisdictions outside the united states have taken steps to prohibit surcharging in october 2013 a federal court granted declaratory relief and issued an order permanently enjoining the enforcement of new yorks nosurcharge law ny gen bus law section 518 in a case brought by five retailers challenging the constitutionality of that law 

data protection and information security  in accordance with governing law we devote substantial resources to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and under certain circumstances to provide account holder notification in the event of a security breach in addition the us federal financial institutions examination council periodically reviews aspects of our operations in the united states to examine our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirements and standards as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctioned countries  we are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the us bank secrecy act as amended including the usa patriot act of 2001 in addition we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets controls “ofac” that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals as well as with specificallydesignated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers terrorists and terrorist organizations we have policies procedures systems and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions 

governmentimposed market participation influences and restrictions  our market reach remains limited by certain governments influence on their domestic payments competition andor their protection of domestic issuers or payments network processors regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries for instance in response to the us and eu sanctions the russian government has modified their national payments systems laws to require among other things i onshore processing for transactions between russian cardholders and merchants ii a material guarantee deposit and significant fines for domestic transactions not processed by a nationally significant payment system and iii the creation of a new domestic payment processor as a result international payment brands are mandated to process russian domestic transactions on the governmentowned payment system 

regulation of internet mobile payment and other types of transactions  many jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations that require payments system participants including our financial institution clients and us to monitor identify filter restrict or take other specific actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions for example us federal legislation has been enacted that requires payment system operators to implement a system that allows issuers to identify internet gambling transactions so they have the option to decline such 

 10 

transaction requests state governments have been interested in the potential blocking of internet interstate sales of cigarettes and alcohol or the collection of state and local sales taxes on such internet purchases implementing such systems increases costs for our financial institution clients and us and may reduce merchant acceptance of visabranded cards and payment products for these purchases 

the us congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on our financial institution clients and us some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including mobile payment transactions money transfer identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients directly these new requirements and developments may affect our financial institution clients ability to offer existing products and services extend credit via payment cards and products and offer new types of payment programs which could decrease our transaction volumes and revenues

 item 1a risk factors 

regulatory risks 

additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction as those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and overall payments volume 

we have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the united states and many other geographies in the united states the doddfrank act has limited our ability to establish default debit interchange reimbursement rates see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  interchange reimbursement rates have also become subject to continued or increased government regulation elsewhere and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates in certain jurisdictions interchange reimbursement rates our operating regulations and related practices are subject to continuing or increased government regulation these jurisdictions include for example australia canada brazil europe india mexico malaysia russia and south africa 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive it may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems like competitors closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers in addition as a result of such regulations we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers in certain instances 

 11 

some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange reimbursement rate leading merchants not to accept visabranded cards or payment products or to steer account holders to alternate payment systems or forms of payment in addition some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us and reductions in the rates that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs for these reasons additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may make visabranded cards and payment products less desirable reduce our overall transaction volumes and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

additional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transactions we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

in order to provide account holders a consistent experience and transparency into visanet we promote certain practices to ensure that visabranded cards are processed over our network we have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only our network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity 

in addition certain network or issuer rules or practices may be viewed as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks coreside on visa debit cards for example visas operating regulations require that all authorization clearance and settlement of international transactions must be done through visanet these are commonly referred to as routing rules 

the doddfrank act already limits our and issuers ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  additional regulations like the doddfrank act in the united states and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process in order to retain that transaction volume we may reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers acquirers or merchants any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

as of october 1 2011 in accordance with the doddfrank act the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to a significant reduction from the average systemwide fees charged previously the federal reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

 on march 21 2014 the court of appeals for the dc circuit reversed a district court ruling invalidating these rules and agreed with the federal reserve except for a single issue related to the interchange cost calculation which was referred back to the federal reserve for reconsideration on august 18 2014 the plaintiff merchants filed a petition for review of the appeals courts decision in the us supreme court seeking review of a portion of the rules pertaining to the interchange cost calculation the rules   described above   remain in place while the case is ongoing these regulations have adversely affected our us debit business and associated revenues by creating negative pressure on our pricing reduced the volume and number of us debit payments we process and diminished associated revenues although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the regulations as issued in october 2011 our business could continue to be affected including if the federal reserve issues new regulations 

these pressures have arisen through various channels other debit networks may become more aggressive in offering merchant cost reductions to win routing preference which in turn puts more pressure on the business terms offered by visa a number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue some clients elected to issue fewer cards enabled with visaaffiliated networks or reduced the number of debit cards they issued and investments they made in marketing and rewards programs while others 

 12 

imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer account holders to other debit networks based on lower cost or other factors other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future 

the doddfrank act created an independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent these actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to issuers consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures payment card practices fees routing and other matters with respect to credit debit and prepaid cards 

some elements of the doddfrank act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the rules our interpretation may result in a pursuit of strategies that may be less effective than those of our competitors overall the regulations and developments arising from the doddfrank act could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

new laws or regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or of other product offerings  

regulators around the world increasingly note each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another the doddfrank act and the european union commission  s draft interchange regulation are developments with such potential see note 20 — legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report  similarly new laws and regulations involving one product offering may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example regulations affecting debit payments could eventually spread to credit payments 

the risks created by a new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offerings as a result we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates network exclusivity preferred routing dynamic currency conversion point of sale transaction rules and practices and operating regulations that may differ from country to country or by product offering 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services and fees and other important aspects of our business in the various regions in addition adverse developments regulations and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which may materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands  

governments in some countries provide resources to or protection for their domestic payment card networks brands and processors these governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country in china for example unionpay continues to enjoy advantages over international networks remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in light of the us and eu sanctions targeting russia ’ s financial sector the russian government has modified its national payments systems laws that require among other things the creation of a national payment system and local storage of certain transaction data as a result international payment brands could be mandated to process russian domestic transactions on the governmentowned payment system additional laws or mandates may be put into place without sufficient notice which may increase our costs and decrease the number of visabranded cards issued or processed in russia these actions could impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our financial institution clients in those countries and substantially restrict our activities there these actions could also force us to leave countries where we presently have activity and keep us from entering new markets although we are trying to effect change in these countries we may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands 

 13 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of visabranded cards issued our payments volume and our revenues  

privacy data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states and elsewhere for example in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions who have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances and the breadth of these notices our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands these measures may increase visa ’ s and our clients costs decrease the number of visabranded cards our clients issue and decrease our payments volume and revenue 

evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us leading to increased costs decreased payments volume and a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for further growth and overall business  

regulation of the payments industry has evolved and increased significantly examples include 

 

 

 

 

 14 

 

 

 complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities our programs and policies are designed to comply with antimoney laundering antiterrorism sanctions regulations and other laws and we continue to enhance them but as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our global brand reputation the impact of such regulations on our clients and on us may increase compliance costs and reduce the volume of payments we process moreover such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer the countries in which visabranded cards are used and the types of account holders and merchants who can obtain or accept visabranded cards any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our overall business revenues prospects for future growth financial condition and results of operations 

litigation risks 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments  

our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation which is described in note 3 — retrospective responsibility plan  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our ipo and any subsequent offerings of our shares of class a common stock or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings they also include a loss sharing agreement a judgment sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement as amended in addition our us financial institution clients are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to visa usa incs certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique complicated and tiered and if we cannot use one or more of them this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

the principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rates see note 20 — legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report  beginning in 2005 a series of complaints the majority of which were styled as class actions were filed on behalf of merchants against us mastercard andor other defendants including certain visa member financial institutions we refer to this as the interchange multidistrict litigation or mdl 1720 among other allegations the plaintiffs alleged that visas setting of default interchange reimbursement rates violated federal antitrust laws and in some cases certain state unfair competition laws the lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york 

the plaintiffs in mdl 1720 seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount rates as well as injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that estimated damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages would be trebled 

the allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february 7 2011 and amended august 26 2014 see note 3 — retrospective responsibility plan  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report visas portion of a settlement or judgment 

 15 

covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan 

we signed settlement agreements in connection with mdl 1720 which included an agreement to pay approximately 40 billion to the class plaintiffs on january 14 2014 the court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement from which a number of objectors have appealed until the appeals are finally adjudicated no assurance can be provided that we will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement 

a number of merchants have filed optout cases in various federal district courts all of the cases filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over mdl 1720 or have been transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation for inclusion in mdl 1720 the court has entered an order confirming that mdl 1720 includes i all current and future actions transferred to mdl 1720 by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceedings and ii all actions filed in the eastern district of new york that arise out of operative facts as alleged in the cases subject to the transfer orders of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation cases that are transferred to or otherwise included in mdl 1720 are covered litigation for purposes of the retrospective responsibility plan it is possible that some optout cases may not be transferred or otherwise included in mdl 1720 and will not be covered litigation  

failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent the retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation the plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our ipo that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation see — if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages  in addition nonmonetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business see — limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability  therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation 

if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages  

like many other large companies we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competitionantitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others examples of such claims are described more fully in note 20 — legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability accordingly we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings 

particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit such as the us or canadian merchant class action lawsuits monetary damages could be significant see note 20 — legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material pending or future legal proceedings we may have to pay substantial damages   this could result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow and financial condition and could even cause us to become insolvent 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability  

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation we may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation for example under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation we have agreed among other things to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions in certain circumstances 

these and other settlements of or judgments in past pending and future litigation could force us to limit the rates we charge revise our rules about rates charged to consumers who use visabranded payment products or 

 16 

make other modifications to our business these modifications could materially and adversely affect our payments volume revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

tax examinations or disputes or changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments  

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in disputes with the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19 — income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

we have limited rights to enforce our agreement with visa europe which includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities  

the relationship between visa and visa europe is governed by the framework agreement in the event visa europe fails to meet its obligations under the framework agreement our remedies are limited we are unable to terminate the agreement even upon visa europes material uncured breach we also have a call option to acquire visa europe which can be triggered only under extremely limited circumstances see note 2 — visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

under the framework agreement we may be required to indemnify visa europe for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their actions relating to the payments business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents engaged in the actions giving rise to such claims the indemnity obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities 

visa europe is obligated to indemnify visa inc and visa international service association visa international in connection with the european competition proceedings in our opinion including payment of any fines or damages that may be imposed however visa europe has informed us of its position that it is not obligated to indemnify us or visa international for any claim in the european competition proceedings including claims asserted in either the european commission matter or the filed or unfiled claims in the uk merchant litigation if visa europe continues in its refusal to indemnify us and we cannot enforce the indemnity we could be exposed to significant liabilities which would not be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan see note 20 — legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

business risks 

the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits  

pressure on client pricing poses challenges for our business in order to stay competitive we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand their visabranded card base these include upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments we have continued to increase the use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states in addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where our products coreside with other networks and merchants have a choice of network routing options the economic pressures on our clients arising from the doddfrank act have also increased our use of incentives see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business   as a result the provision of certain products and services may be less profitable or unprofitable which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 

if we continue to increase incentives to our clients we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing the amount of feebased services we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from longterm contracts with certain clients including those that are large contributors to our revenue continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from maintaining such agreements in the future on the same or favorable terms we may also 

 17 

have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations while we may implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives we may not be successful in our efforts or they may not offset the decreases in our revenues 

intense competition in our industry may cause our business financial condition results of operations and prospects for future growth to suffer  

the global payments industry is intensely competitive and as a result our payment programs compete against all forms of payment these include cash checks electronic ecommerce and mobile payments as well as traditional general purpose card networks in addition our openloop payments network competes against other alternate payment systems such as closedloop payment systems the doddfrank act increased this competitive pressure 

some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology or have greater financial resources they may offer a wider range of programs products and services than we do including more innovative ones they may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments these include domestic networks in the united states china canada and australia they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other developments in many cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions 

traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services the risk to maintaining or securing our clients longterm commitments to our products increased with the doddfrank acts restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector we do not have exclusivity with our largest clients such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstances our clients may terminate these relationships on relatively short notice without significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of these clients this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations see note 13 — enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

we expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future for example 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 18 

 our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth 

disintermediation from the payments value chain could harm our business  

our position in the payments value chain is key to our business some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternate payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without any intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model regulatory actions such as the doddfrank act may provide them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although other competitors are pursuing similar lines of business or adopting similar commercial models they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in us losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients which could materially and adversely affect our business revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth  

additional consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors or with one of our competitors directly this could result in the acquired financial institutions visa business shifting to a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business to us 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of new and existing clients who may seek and obtain greater pricing discounts or other incentives from us in addition more consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volumebased discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth 

merchants continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement incentive arrangements and other initiatives  

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visabranded payment cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuits if they continue we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses 

we also face competitive pressures on pricing we and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of visabranded payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain large merchants some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions using both traditional and new technology platforms   examples include closedloop payment systems   that are specific to a single merchant   or multimerchant solutions like the merchant customer exchange which is designed for a mobile platform and has many merchant participants   such programs may offer unique or specialized benefits to consumers including discounts or customized offers   if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our transaction volume 

all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives 

 19 

certain financial institutions or merchants have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue or accept payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues  

certain financial institutions or merchants have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue or accept payment cards these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in addition these financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from growing our business and revenues 

failure to maintain relationships with issuers acquirers merchants and account holders and the failure of our financial institution clients or third parties to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business  

we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support and to compete effectively for our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these competitive card features for their customers 

as a result of the doddfrank acts changes to the network exclusivity rules we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants acquirers and processors we already engage in many cobranding efforts in which we contract with merchants who directly receive incentives from us we also engage with merchants acquirers and processors and provide incentives to promote routing preference and acceptance growth as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships 

outside the united states some governments only permit local providers to complete domestic processing which prohibits us from overseeing the endtoend processing of the transactions therefore we depend on our close working relationships with our clients in these regions to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving visabranded cards our inability to oversee the endtoend processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands 

in addition we depend on third parties and our financial institution clients to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and to the extent that such thirdparty vendors or our financial institution clients fail to perform or deliver adequate services our business and reputation could be impaired 

negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation which are key assets of our business  

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain account holders and financial institution clients to visabranded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industrys quality of service use and protection of account holder data regulatory compliance financial condition corporate responsibility and other factors negative perception or publicity particularly in light of the rapid widespread use of social media channels could cause damage to our brands and reputation our business may also be affected by actions taken by our clients or other third parties or by circumstances that are outside of our control 

 

 

 

 20 

 any of these factors could turn clients and consumers away from our brand and products require us to take on additional liabilities and costs result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny and materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have affected and are likely to continue to affect our clients merchants and account holders and may potentially impact our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

the current threats to global economic growth include geopolitical instability in russia ukraine the middle east and other oil producing countries which could affect oil prices economic fragility in the eurozone and in the united states higher interest rates hurting the housing market sluggish job creation political discord spending cuts and debt defaults while there continues to be some improvements in advanced economies emerging economies continue to suffer with slower growth consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt levels elevated housing inventory deflation changes in savings rates continued equity market volatility decreased export activity lowered government spending and additional government intervention furthermore continued challenges in the credit environment bank instability downgrades of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issues affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policies could also impact our clients merchants and account holders 

the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments or crises were to arise around the world these include defaults on government debt exhaustion of national economic stimulus packages significant increases in oil prices tax increases a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps most recently the economic situations in various countries in europe have been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of debt defaults if such defaults occur or if the measures taken to avert such defaults create their own instability economic turmoil is likely to result and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant 

the volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economies and the responses by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones these include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 21 

 

 

 

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and in multicurrency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions  

 

 

 transactions outside the united states represent an increasingly important part of our strategy which we hope will continue to grow however a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and multicurrency transactions will decrease the number of crossborder transactions we process and our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected 

we risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications  

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement while the amount of our indemnification obligations has no limit our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time 

concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial 

 22 

resources any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we estimate settlement exposure under the indemnity based on the sum of three inputs the first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin the second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume the third is the total balance for outstanding visa travelers cheques we generally guarantee the payment of any validly issued visa travelers cheque that has been negotiated in good faith and properly presented for payment in the event that the cheque is not honored by its issuing institution additionally from time to time we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary see note 11 — settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report 

some of our clients are considered group members under visas operating regulations as a result some of these group members have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flow 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services or comply with new laws and regulations the use of our products our revenues and net income could decline  

rapid significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry these include developments in smart cards ecommerce mobile and radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we work closely with third parties including some potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industrywide standards new laws and regulations resistance to change from clients or merchants or third parties intellectual property rights if we are unable to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards it could materially and adversely affect the use of our products our revenues and net income  

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or compromised the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected  

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunctions fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in longdistance or local telecommunications access fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks effects of climate change or other catastrophic events 

in addition our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks the latter could include computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denialofservice attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties equipment and data they could also compromise data security see — account data breaches involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues  if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded   finally potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks 

additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenues or operating results 

 23 

account data breaches involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues  

our clients merchants other service providers and we process store or transmit account holder information in connection with visabranded cards and payment products in addition our clients may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems processing storing or transmission of sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visabranded cards reputational damage and claims against us a breach may subject visa to governmental or regulatory investigations which could result in fines or enforcement actions against the company if we are sued in any lawsuit in connection with any material data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of visabranded cards which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our compliance costs 

an increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving visabranded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of visabranded cards or payment products  

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture account holder information they use this information to conduct fraudulent transactions and to engage in other forms of illegal activities involving our payment products outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing as a result more third parties are involved in processing transactions using visabranded cards or payment products a rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving visabranded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands this could reduce the use and acceptance of visabranded cards and payment products or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs and materially and adversely affect our payments volume and revenues 

failure to maintain interoperability with visa europes systems could damage the business and global perception of the visa brands  

visa and visa europe maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement systems as a result we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories regardless of where it originates visa europes independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to increasing costs and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between visa europe and us could negatively affect account holders from visa europe using payment products in the countries we serve or our account holders using payment products in visa europes region failure to authorize clear and settle interterritory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands 

structural and organizational risks 

due to the nature of our relationship and the terms we have agreed to with visa europe we have little ability to control its operations in its region and as a result we may experience added costs and challenges in operating our business  

visa europes exclusive license of our trademarks and technologies under the framework agreement gives us little ability to control and oversee visa europes operations in its region if we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that may be viewed as unfavorable to visa europe and its members visa europe is not required to implement the changes unless we agree to pay for the associated implementation costs this may result in added costs and expenses to our business furthermore the licenses granted under the framework agreement may raise licensing payment and associated tax treatment concerns 

visa europe may hinder our ability to acquire new businesses or to operate them effectively in its region if the acquired business has operations in visa europes region visa europe may play a significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decisions and costs there finally visa europe may undertake operational and litigation strategies including but not limited to our ongoing litigation in the uk and our ongoing case with the european commission that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally 

 24 

if visa europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock under its put option we are likely to incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income  

we have granted visa europe a put option which visa europe can exercise at any time and which would require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from visa europes members within 285 days given current economic conditions the purchase price under the terms of the put option could likely be in excess of 10 billion dollars and we may need to obtain thirdparty financing in order to meet our obligation through the issuance of either debt or equity an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price with our stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders see — future sales of our class a common stock or the end of transfer restrictions on our class b common stock could result in dilution to holders of our existing class a common stock which could adversely affect their rights and depress the market price of our class a common stock  

  sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms see note 2 — visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in item   8  of this report in addition we are required to assess any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as necessary on our consolidated statements of operations consequently the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these changes in the fair value of the put option could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and increase any associated costs 

if we acquire visa europe we may also encounter difficulties in integrating visa europes business and systems into our existing operations if we cannot do so quickly and costeffectively the integration could divert the time and resources of senior management and other key resources disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we would become subject to any ongoing or future regulatory disputes as a result of eu regulations that govern the operations of visa europe we may also be required to assume any ongoing or future litigation involving visa europe 

if we cannot remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly dynamic competitive economic and regulatory environment  

for us to remain organizationally effective we must effectively empower and deploy our management and operational resources and incorporate both global and local perspectives into our decisions and processes if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand quickly and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory 

in addition if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks execute our strategy and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed we may not be successful in this increasingly dynamic competitive economic and regulatory environment 

we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees  

our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract motivate and retain highly qualified employees or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could adversely affect our business and our future success 

acquisitions strategic investments and entries into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations  

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses products or technologies we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them we are also subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in visa europes territory which will impact our ability to expand or conduct business in those regions regulatory constraints particularly competition regulations may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisitions or investments 

furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenues although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that they will be successful 

 25 

with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisitions or through organic development these include digital ecommerce and mobile payments our recent entry into these businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

future sales of our class a common stock or the end of transfer restrictions on our class b common stock could result in dilution to holders of our existing class a common stock which could adversely affect their rights and depress the market price of our class a common stock  

the market price of our class a common stock could fall as a result of many factors under our retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock future offerings of our class a common stock or the end of the transfer restrictions on our class b common stock would increase the number of class a common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price and dilute the voting power of our existing class   a common stock the market price of our class   a common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase in the number of class a common stock outstanding could occur in the future 

if funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class a common stock will be diluted  

under our retrospective responsibility plan funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us at that time each share of class   b common stock will become convertible into shares of class a common stock benefiting the holders of class   b common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holders of class   a common stock the amount of funds released and the market price of our class a common stock will determine the extent of the dilution 

holders of our class b and c common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class a common stock  

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock can vote on certain significant transactions these include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law the holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with holders of class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control  

provisions contained in our current certificate of incorporation in our current bylaws and under delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable for instance except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance in addition except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to visa members as defined in our current certificate of incorporation no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis 

our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows  

since august 2008 we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class a b and c common stock the payment of dividends if any is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including but not limited to our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant if as a result of these factors we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to pay dividends to all of our stockholders specifically if a dividend is declared or paid an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast secure and reliable electronic payments we provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of visabranded payment products including credit debit and prepaid we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions merchants consumers businesses and government entities each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic forms of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities particularly outside the united states we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide 

overall economic conditions  our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal 2014 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery 

financial highlights during fiscal 2014 we recorded net income of 54 billion or 862 diluted earnings per share an increase of 9 and 14 over the prior year respectively for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 we recorded adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share as follows 



 we recorded net operating revenues of 127 billion for fiscal 2014 an increase of 8 over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume processed transactions and crossborder volume the general strengthening of the us dollar during the year resulted in a two percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth 

total operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were 50 billion and included 450 million of litigation provision related to the interchange multidistrict litigation excluding this provision adjusted operating expenses remained flat at 46 billion over prior year operating expenses primarily due to a reduction in professional fees and personnel expenses offset by continued investments in infrastructure technology and network processing to support our global growth initiatives 

adjusted financial results our financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years as they are either nonrecurring have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan as such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 

 31 

the following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012 there were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013 





 interchange multidistrict litigation on october 19 2012 visa mastercard various us financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation on december 10 2012 visa paid approximately 40 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement on january 14 2014 the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes however have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed optout claims takedown payments of approximately 11 billion related to the optout merchants were received on january 27 2014 and deposited into the litigation escrow account the deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued 

 32 

litigation to address optout claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we deposited 450 million  of operating cash into the litigation escrow account and recorded an additional accrual of 450 million  associated with the optout claims resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to covered litigation of 14 billion  at september 30 2014  see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

reduction in asconverted shares  during fiscal 2014  total asconverted class a common stock was reduced by 22 million  shares at an average price of 20915  per share using 46 billion  of operating cash on hand of the 46 billion  41 billion  was used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market in addition we deposited 450 million  of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan the deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class a common stock because it reduces the class b conversion rate and consequently the asconverted class a common stock share count see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

the stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the 50 billion  share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in october 2013  as of september 30 2014  the program had remaining authorized funds of 682 million  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2013  have been completed in october 2014  our board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion  share repurchase program see note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues nominal payments volume growth in the united states gained momentum over the prior year with sustained doubledigit growth in consumer credit elevated growth in consumer debit which had been negatively impacted by the doddfrank act beginning april 1 2012 and doubledigit growth in commercial products nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the us dollar on a constantdollar basis which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended june 30 2014 is 15 compared to 14 for the prior year comparable period continued doubledigit growth in the number of processed transactions accelerated modestly over the prior year reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visabranded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services as well as the number of transactions processed on our network we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visabranded cards or payment products our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues  consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of visabranded payment products and solutions current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with visa europe data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by cybersources online payment gateway platform  data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered 

international transaction revenues  are earned for crossborder transaction processing and currency conversion activities crossborder transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant international transaction revenues are primarily generated by crossborder payments and cash volume 

 35 

other revenues  consist mainly of license fees for use of the visa brand revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement fees from account holder services licensing and certification and other activities related to our acquired entities other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended account holder protection and concierge services   

client incentives consist of longterm contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visabranded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel includes salaries employee benefits incentive compensation sharebased compensation and contractor expense 

network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions of the visa brand 

professional fees  mainly consist of fees for consulting legal and other professional services 

depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software also included in this amount is amortization of finitelived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions 

general and administrative  mainly consists of facilities costs travel activities foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business 

litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile the specifics of the cases advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date 

nonoperating income 

nonoperating income mainly includes income gains and losses earned on investments accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions and the change in the fair value of the visa europe put option 

visa inc fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the united states internationally and from visa europe revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements 



  36 

the increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume processed transactions and crossborder volume these benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives overall revenue growth decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to prior year due to the negative impact of lower foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues and the general strengthening of the us dollar in fiscal 2014 combined with the absence of pricing modifications that benefited fiscal 2013 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars the effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2014 as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in an overall decline of about two percentage points in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2013 while we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2015  a general strengthening of the us dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2015 net of offsetting hedges see note 12—derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues 

  37 

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses 



  38 

nonoperating income 

nonoperating income in fiscal 2014  of 27 million  increased from 18 million  in fiscal 2013  primarily due to the absence of a 15 million otherthantemporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013 see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements the decrease in fiscal 2013 from 68 million in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012   of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense see note 19—income taxes  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate of 30  in fiscal 2014  differs from the effective income tax rate of 31  in fiscal 2013 mainly due to 

 the effective income tax rate of 31  in fiscal 2013 differs from the effective income tax rate of 3  in fiscal 2012 mainly due to 

 

adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012  our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in that or future years as they were either nonrecurring had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan as such we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense additional covered litigation provision recorded and a onetime noncash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the california state apportionment rules 

 39 

we expect our effective tax rate for the full 2015 fiscal year to be in the low 30s 

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 

  

operating activities reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation including 

 the cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 

absent the above impacts cash provided by operating activities increased in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 to approximately 65 billion and 59 billion respectively reflecting growth in total operating revenues in both years see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year reflecting a decrease in purchases of availableforsale investment securities offset by a decrease in proceeds received from maturities and sales of availableforsale investment securities we also used cash on hand to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest ownership cash used in investing activities was 

 40 

lower during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting a decrease in purchases of availableforsale investment securities combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of availableforsale investment securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

financing activities reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above under operating activities as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan additionally reported financing activities include deposits into the litigation escrow account of 450 million and 17 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2012 respectively absent all of the above impacts which are related to the interchange litigation cash used in financing activities was 50 billion 61 billion and 940 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease in fiscal 2014 and increase in fiscal 2013 are primarily due to changes in cash used to repurchase shares of our class a common stock in the open market see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  note 14—stockholders equity  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide we believe that cash flow generated from operations in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled 55 billion  at september 30 2014  if it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the united states we would be required to pay us taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the united states as such we have not accrued us income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately 50 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds the amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable 

availableforsale investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 30 billion  are classified as noncurrent as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however these investments are generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment see item 1a—risk factors  included elsewhere in this report 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes under the program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the program at september 30 2014  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

credit facility on january 29 2014  we entered into an unsecured 30 billion  revolving credit facility the credit facility which expires on january 28 2015  replaced our previous 30 billion  credit facility which terminated on january 29 2014  the new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type there were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended september 30 2014  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

universal shelf registration statement in july 2012 we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions this registration statement expires in july 2015 

 41 

litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation will be payable when we fund the litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2014  was 15 billion  and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2014  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions during fiscal 2014  we were not required to fund settlementrelated working capital our average daily net settlement position was a payable of 261 million 

covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account during fiscal 2013  we made 44 billion  in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account of which 40 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation on january 14 2014 the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals certain merchants in the settlement classes however have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed optout claims takedown payments of approximately 11 billion related to the optout merchants was received in january 2014 and deposited into the litigation escrow account receipt of the takedown payments increases our current taxable income by approximately 11 billion and income tax payable by about 368 million which was fully paid by the end of fiscal 2014 at september 30 2014  the litigation escrow account had an available balance of 15 billion  see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan   and   note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs 

reduction in asconverted shares  during fiscal 2014  total asconverted class a common stock was reduced by 22 million  shares at an average price of 20915  per share using 46 billion  of operating cash on hand of the 46 billion  41 billion  was used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market in addition we deposited 450 million  of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan the deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class a common stock because it reduces the class b conversion rate and consequently the asconverted class a common stock share count see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

 42 

the stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the 50 billion  share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in october 2013  as of september 30 2014  the program had remaining authorized funds of 682 million  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to october 2013  have been completed in october 2014  our board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion  share repurchase program see note 14—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

dividends  during fiscal 2014  we paid 10 billion  in dividends in october 2014  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 048  per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 297 million  in connection with this dividend on december 2 2014  see note 14—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by the board of directors classes of b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

visa europe put option we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies visa incs forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 

 the fair value of the put option represents the value of visa europes option which under certain conditions could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value at september 30 2014  we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately 145 million  while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2014  it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation given current economic conditions the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of 10 billion we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things visa europes adjusted sustainable income and our pe ratio in each case as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 

given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purposes only a range of pe ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates 500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the 500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september 30 2014  or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise its option we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a forprofit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and as a result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated pe ratios for each 100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed 500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september 30 2014  our estimated longterm pe ratio was 169 x and the longterm pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe was 19 x at september 30 2014  the spot pe ratio was 206 x and the spot pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe was 20 x these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future 

 43 



 pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service age and eligible compensation we also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 14 million  4 million  and 88 million  respectively the lower contributions in fiscal 2014  and 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012 were driven by a higherthanexpected rate of return on our plan assets and an increase in the discount rate in fiscal 2015  given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately 10 million  the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences see note 10—pension postretirement and other benefits  to our consolidated financial statements 

capital expenditures  our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2014  due to investments in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives 

acquisitions during fiscal 2014  we acquired a business in which we previously held a minority interest using 134 million of cash on hand this amount primarily reflects the purchase price of 170 million less cash received the acquisition extends our processing capabilities internationally there were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 and 2012 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2014  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 73 billion  of assets and 151 million  of liabilities of these instruments 152 million  had significant unobservable inputs including the visa europe put option liability of 145 million  and 7 million  of auction rate securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

indemnifications 

we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if 

 44 

certain credit standards are not met see   note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 11—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2014 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities 



  45 

likely be in excess of 10 billion the fair value of the visa europe put option itself totaling 145 million  at september 30 2014 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of visas obligation in the event of exercise see the liquidity and capital resources  and critical accounting estimates  sections of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements 

 critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visabranded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language eg early termination clauses managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customerreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2014  client incentives represented 17  of gross operating revenues 

fair value — visa europe put option 

critical estimates we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies our forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is 

 46 

exercised to visa europes projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 

upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 

the fair value of visa europes option was estimated to be approximately 145 million  at september 30 2014  while the put option is in fact nontransferable this amount recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a thirdparty market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the terms of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a thirdparty market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option 

while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2014  it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised given current economic conditions the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of 10 billion see the liquidity and capital resources section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 

assumptions and judgment the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to as the pe differential 

probability of exercise— exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under its articles of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to i visa europes stated intentions ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results iii evaluation of market conditions including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europes largest members which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

pe differential— the pe differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward pricetoearnings multiples applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purposes the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors quantitatively we estimate our pe ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months the “longterm pe calculation” and the last 30 trading dates the “30day pe calculation” prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our longterm pricetoearnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30day pe calculation as compared to the longterm pe calculation in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences if any are the result of a fundamental change in our longterm value or the result of shortterm market volatility or other noncompany specific market factors that may not be indicative of our longterm forward pe we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that a market participant would more heavily weigh longterm value indicators as opposed to shortterm indicators 

factors that might indicate a fundamental change in longterm value include but are not limited to changes in the regulatory environment client portfolios longterm growth rates or new product innovations a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies 

 47 

other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise its option the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europes current business model as an association owned by its member banks while the highest reflect a successful shift to a forprofit model in anticipation of its exercise the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that should it choose to exercise its option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a forprofit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europes results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2014  we have assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated longterm pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19 x the use of a probability of exercise that is 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 18 million  in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million  in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe as such the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2014  classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation the plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance in fiscal 2014 we recorded litigation accruals totaling 15 billion  for covered litigation reflecting 11 billion of takedown payments received and an additional provision of 450 million see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 20—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

 48 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the us dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the us dollar value of payments in foreign currencies primarily for expenses at our nonus locations we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated nonus dollar denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 13 billion  at september 30 2014  and 2013  the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2014  is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10  change in the value of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately 90 million  on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2014  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 12—derivative financial instruments   to our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our operating results or cash flows have been nor are expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2014  and 2013  were 30 billion  and 35 billion  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately 32 million on our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2014  the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 19 billion  and 11 billion  at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively 

visa europe put option 

we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september 30 2014  we are required to assess the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as necessary in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2014  we have assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19 x the use of a probability of exercise 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an 

 49 

increase of approximately 18 million  in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million  in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 

pension plan risk 

at september 30 2014  and 2013  our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 11 billion  and projected benefit obligations were 983 million  and 897 million  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2015  if any which would be made in september 2015

business 

tableend general business development 

visa inc which we refer to as visa or the company is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast secure and reliable electronic payments we operate one of the worlds most advanced processing networks —visanet — which facilitates authorization clearing and settlement of payment transactions worldwide it also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants visa is not a bank and does not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on visabranded cards and payment products in most cases account holder and merchant relationships belong to and are managed by our financial institution clients 

visa inc was incorporated in the state of delaware in may 2007 in october 2007 we undertook a reorganization in which visa usa inc visa international service association visa canada corporation and inovant llc became direct or indirect subsidiaries of visa inc visa europe limited remains owned and governed by its european member financial institutions and is not a subsidiary of visa inc visa inc completed its initial public offering ipo in march 2008 

since fiscal 2010 we have completed several acquisitions to accelerate the growth of visas digital ecommerce and mobile commerce offerings these include cybersource corporation a leading provider of electronic payment risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants playspan inc a leading provider of digital goods transactions in online games digital media and social networks and fundamo a leading provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies 

business developments in fiscal 2013 included the following 

 in mature markets visa continues to expand in digital channels vme visa’s digital wallet service and acceptance mark is now commercially available in the united states where it is featured on more than fifty merchant sites and has also launched in australia and canada we have also licensed paywave visas mobile nfc payment technology to thirdparty wallet providers to help ensure their solutions are enabled with visas payment functionality and we have signed agreements with several mobile operators to extend payment functionality to their mobile subscribers in addition we continue to certify nfcenabled smartphones from device manufacturers for use with paywave and we have partnered with samsung to preload paywave on samsung’s nfcenabled smartphones to further support the enablement of nfc visa also offers the visa mobile provisioning service — a solution that enables banks and mobile operators to securely provision mobile payment accounts on nfcenabled smartphones

 nature of operations 

visas mission is to accelerate the electronification of commerce we operate an openloop payments network in which visa connects and manages the exchange of information and value between i issuers — financial institutions that issue visabranded cards or payment products to account holders and ii acquirers — financial institutions that contract with merchants to accept visabranded cards or payment products we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visabranded cards or payment products the issuers have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by the account holders 

interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in our openloop payments network on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in addition we generally do not earn any revenue from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate the acquirers are typically responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

 5 

a typical visa transaction begins when the account holder presents his or her visabranded card or payment product to a merchant as payment for goods or services the transaction information is then transmitted electronically to the acquirer and routed through visanet to the issuer for authorization following authorization a clearing file containing the final transaction data is submitted from the acquirer and processed for final settlement between the issuer and acquirer the following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction on visanet 

our operating revenues are comprised principally of service revenues data processing revenues and international transaction revenues and are reduced by costs incurred under client incentive arrangements the company has one reportable segment payment services 

 although us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and typically do not result in a receivable or payable balance settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days resulting in amounts due from and to financial institution clients these amounts are presented as settlement receivable and settlement payable on our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

in order to maintain the integrity of and minimize disruptions to our payments network we indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to honor visabranded 

 6 

cards and payment products processed in accordance with our operating regulations the settlement indemnification applies to the amount of visa payment transactions that have occurred but have not yet settled we maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met cash equivalents collateral is reflected in customer collateral on our consolidated balance sheets as it is held in escrow in our name all other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets during the past ten years visa has incurred only one settlement indemnification loss for fifty thousand dollars in 2004 

core products and services 

visa provides a wide variety of payment solutions that support payment products that issuers can offer to their account holders i pay now with debit ii pay ahead with prepaid or iii pay later with credit products visa also offers a growing suite of innovative digital ecommerce and mobile products and services these services facilitate transactions on our network among account holders merchants financial institutions and governments in mature and emerging markets globally 

 our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between our issuers and acquirers visanet is built on a centralized architecture enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide valueadded services including information products such as risk scoring and loyalty applications while the transaction data is being routed through our network 

visas processing services continue to expand to address the needs of all participants in the evolving payments ecosystem through such offerings as our merchant gateway and visa debit processing services dps merchant gateway services provided through our cybersource subsidiaries enable gateway routing and other services that make it easier for ecommerce merchants to accept process and reconcile payments manage fraud and safeguard payment security online dps provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating issuers of visa debit prepaid and atm payment products these and other services support our financial institution clients and their use of our products and promote the growth and security of our payments network 

processing infrastructure 

visanet consists of multiple synchronized processing centers including two data centers in the united states which are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy in addition in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement among visa inc visa europe limited and others visa europes processing centers in the united kingdom must maintain interoperability with visas synchronized system intelligent access points around the world complete the visanet global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and valueadded services 

visa also owns and manages additional data centers in the united states and internationally including those we added with our acquisitions of cybersource and playspan these facilities enable transaction services and provide uninterrupted connectivity for account holders our financial institution clients and our processing partners 

intellectual property 

our portfolio of trademarks in particular our visa plus the “winged v” design and the “dove” design marks are important to our business through agreements with our financial institution clients we authorize the use of some of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

 7 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 accounted for more than 30 of our operating revenues in those years 

working capital 

payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily working capital requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

concentration of business and financial information about geographic areas 

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data — note 13—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment these include 

 based on payments volume total volume and number of transactions visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world the following chart compares our network with those of our major general purpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2012 



 certain general purpose payment network competitors are more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the united states our competitors also have leading positions in certain countries for example china unionpay remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china 

in the global debit network market segment our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands including star nyce and pulse in the united states eftpos in australia nets in singapore and interac in canada in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by mastercard and many of the debit 

 8 

network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands provide the primary network and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of our overall transaction volume 

the global payments industry continues to undergo dynamic change we may face increasing competition from emerging players in the payment space many of which are nonfinancial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional business model the emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on ecommerce andor mobile technologies paypal google and isis are examples these providers compete with us directly in some cases yet may also be significant partners and customers of ours   

we also face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our financial institution clients we believe our fundamental value proposition of convenience interoperability accessibility and security offers us a key competitive advantage we succeed in part because we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate we do so by partnering with local financial institutions merchants governments nongovernmental organizations and business organizations to provide tailored solutions to meet their varied needs we believe visa is wellpositioned competitively due to our global brand our broad set of visabranded payment products and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably through visanet 

employees 

at september 30 2013 we employed approximately 9500 persons worldwide we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 

government regulation 

interchange reimbursement fees  we have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the united states and many other geographies during fiscal 2012 the federal reserve implemented new rules under the doddfrank act setting a cap on the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for debit products issued by large financial institutions these rules continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of us debit transactions we process and decrease our associated revenues as a result we have significantly modified our debit strategy and continue to renegotiate some portions of our contracts with our financial institution clients in july 2013 a federal court invalidated the newly implemented rules finding that the federal reserve improperly considered certain costs in setting a cap on the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate and that issuers must make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing each electronic debit transaction regardless of authorization method although the court ordered the federal reserve to revise the rules it stayed that order and the rules have been left in place pending the resolution of an expedited appeal filed by the federal reserve to the federal appeals court see   item 1a—risk factors—the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  and item 7 — managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview  included elsewhere in this report 

certain jurisdictions outside the united states also regulate debit interchange reimbursement rates in their regions for example the reserve bank of australia regulates interchange reimbursement rates in some jurisdictions such as india the governing authorities have begun to regulate other rates or practices such as the merchant discount rate see item 1a—risk factors—additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  and item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  included elsewhere in this report 

network exclusivity and routing  we have historically had agreements under which issuers received incentives if they agreed to issue visabranded cards or payment products that are processed through visanet historically issuers of some debit products outside the united states have chosen to include only our network these various practices are referred to as network exclusivity the doddfrank act limits the issuers and our ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the us debit network market segment other jurisdictions have enacted similar limitations see   item 1a—risk factors—the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  included elsewhere in this report 

 9 

us consumer financial protection bureau  the doddfrank act created an independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent the bureaus future actions may make payment card or product transactions generally less attractive to issuers acquirers consumers and merchants 

nosurcharge rules  we have historically implemented rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using their visabranded card or payment product instead of other means as part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation however visa has agreed to modifications of our rules to permit surcharging on credit transactions under certain circumstances see  item 8 — financial statements and supplementary data — note 20—legal matters  included elsewhere in this report eleven us states as well as certain jurisdictions outside the united states have taken steps to limit these nosurcharge rules in october 2013 a federal court granted declaratory relief and issued an order permanently enjoining the enforcement of new yorks nosurcharge law ny gen bus law section 518 based on the entry of a stipulated final judgment in a case brought by five retailers challenging the constitutionality of that law 

data protection and information security  in accordance with governing law we devote substantial resources to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and provide account holder notification in the event of a security breach in addition the us federal financial institutions examination council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the united states to examine our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirements and standards as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctioned countries  we are subject to increasingly expanding legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering terrorist financing fraud and other illicit activity we devote substantial internal and external resources and have implemented programs that are designed to prevent the use of our payments network in facilitating such illegal activity in addition some of our products and services may be subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac these programs prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals as well as with specificallydesignated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers terrorists and terrorist organizations we have developed and implemented policies procedures systems and internal controls that are designed to comply with ofac requirements and comparable sanctions programs 

governmentimposed market participation influences and restrictions  our market reach remains limited by certain governments influence on their domestic payments competition andor their protection of domestic issuers or payment network processors regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries 

regulation of internet transactions  many jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations that require payments system participants including our financial institution clients and us to monitor identify filter restrict or take other specific actions with regard to certain types of internet payment transactions for example us federal legislation has been enacted that requires payment system operators to implement a system that allows issuers to identify internet gambling transactions so they have the option to decline such transaction requests state governments have been interested in the potential blocking of internet interstate sales of cigarettes and alcohol or the collection of state and local sales taxes on such internet purchases implementing such systems increases costs for our financial institution clients and us and may reduce merchant acceptance of visabranded cards and payment products for these purchases 

the us congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on our financial institution clients and us some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that could affect our financial institution clients directly these new requirements and developments may affect our financial institution clients ability to offer existing products and services extend credit via payment cards and products and offer new types of payment programs which could decrease our transaction volumes and revenues

 item 1a risk factors 

regulatory risks 

additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction as those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification 

we have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the united states and many other geographies however the doddfrank act has limited our ability to establish default debit interchange reimbursement rates in the united states see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  interchange reimbursement rates have also become subject to continued or increased government regulation elsewhere and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates in certain jurisdictions interchange reimbursement rates our operating regulations and related practices are subject to continuing or increased government regulation these jurisdictions include for example australia canada brazil europe india malaysia russia and south africa 

when we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers find our payments system less attractive this lowers overall transaction volume and slows growth of transactions it also may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems like competitors closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers in addition we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers in some instances this makes visabranded cards and payment products less desirable and reduces our transaction volumes and profitability some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange reimbursement rate leading merchants not to accept visabranded cards or payment products for payment or to steer account holders to alternate payment systems in addition some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us and reductions in the rates that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs for these reasons additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rates may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

additional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transactions we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

in order to provide account holders a consistent experience and transparency into the network processing their transactions we promote certain practices to ensure that visabranded cards are processed over our network we have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use 

 11 

only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only our network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity 

in addition certain network or issuer rules or practices may be viewed as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks coreside on visa debit cards for example visas rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through visanet and that a member must clear international transactions through visanet these are commonly referred to as routing rules 

the doddfrank act already limits our and issuers ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  additional regulations like the doddfrank act in the united states and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process in order to retain that transaction volume we would have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers acquirers or merchants any of these eventualities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

as of october 1 2011 in accordance with the doddfrank act the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to a significant reduction from the average systemwide fees charged previously the federal reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

in july 2013 a federal court invalidated these rules finding that the federal reserve improperly considered certain costs in setting a cap on the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement rate and that issuers must make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing each electronic debit transaction regardless of authorization method the federal reserve has appealed that ruling these regulations have adversely affected our us debit business and associated revenues by creating negative pressure on our pricing reduced the volume and number of us debit payments we process and diminished associated revenues although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the regulations as issued in october 2011 our business could continue to be affected including if the federal reserve must issue new regulations 

these pressures have arisen through various channels a number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue some reduced the number of debit cards they issued and investments they made in marketing and rewards programs some imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships some elected to issue fewer cards enabled with visaaffiliated networks many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer account holders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future 

the doddfrank act created an independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent these actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to issuers consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures payment card practices fees routing and other matters with respect to credit debit and prepaid cards 

some elements of the doddfrank act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the rules our interpretation may result in a pursuit of strategies that may be less effective than those of our competitors overall the regulations and developments arising from the doddfrank act could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

new laws or regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or of other product offerings  

 12 

regulators around the world increasingly note each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another the doddfrank act and the european union commission  s draft interchange regulation are developments with such potential similarly new laws and regulations involving one product offering may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to other product offerings for example regulations affecting debit payments could eventually spread to credit payments 

the risks created by a new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offerings as a result we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates network exclusivity preferred routing dynamic currency conversion point of sale transaction rules and practices and operating regulations that may differ from country to country or by product offering 

if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings services and fees and other important aspects of our business in the various regions in addition adverse developments regulations and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which may materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands  

governments in some countries provide resources or protection to select their domestic payment card networks brands and processors these governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country for example china unionpay continues to enjoy advantages over international networks remains the sole processor of domestic transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china these actions could impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our financial institution clients in those countries and substantially restrict our activities there these actions could also force us to leave countries where we presently have activity and keep us from entering new markets although we are trying to effect change in these countries we may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of visabranded cards issued our payments volume and our revenues  

privacy data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states and elsewhere for example in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach and those jurisdictions who have these laws are continuing to increase the circumstances and the breadth of these notices these measures may increase our and our clients costs they may also decrease the number of visabranded cards our clients issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands 

evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues  

regulation of the payments industry has evolved and increased significantly examples include 

  13 

specificallydesignated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers terrorists and terrorist organizations some of our clients located outside of the united states may not be subject to these same laws regulations and sanctions and as a result may initiate transactions that while permissible in their countries are not permissible in the united states we have policies procedures systems and controls in place to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions but in the event these controls should fail we could be subject to penalties reputational damage and loss of business 

 complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities our programs and policies are designed to comply with antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctions regulations and we continue to review and enhance them but as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities the impact of such regulations on our clients and on us may increase compliance costs and reduce the volume of payments we process moreover such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer the countries in which visabranded cards are used and the types of account holders and merchants who can obtain or accept visabranded cards any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business prospects for future growth financial condition and results of operations 

litigation risks 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments  

our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation which is described in note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our ipo and any subsequent offerings of our shares of class a common stock or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings they also include a loss sharing agreement and a judgment sharing agreement in addition our us financial institution clients are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to visa usa incs certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique complicated and tiered and if we cannot use one or more of them this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows or even cause us to become insolvent 

 14 

the principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rates since 2005 approximately fiftyfive complaints all but thirteen of which were styled as class actions have been filed on behalf of merchants against us mastercard andor other defendants including certain financial institutions that issue visabranded payment cards and acquire visabranded payment transactions in the united states we refer to this as the interchange multidistrict litigation among other allegations the plaintiffs have alleged that visas setting of default interchange reimbursement rates violated federal and state antitrust laws the lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york 

the plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount rates as well as injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages would be trebled 

the allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february 7 2011 see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report visas portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan 

on october 19 2012 we signed settlement agreements in these cases which included an agreement to pay approximately 40 billion to the class plaintiffs the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement with the class plaintiffs on november 9 2012 however the agreement with the class plaintiffs remains subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeals we cannot assure that the court will provide final approval of the settlement or that we will win any appeals on december 10 2012 visa paid approximately 40 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement 

a number of merchants have filed optout cases in various federal district courts some of these cases have already been transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings to mdl 1720 and will be covered litigation under the retrospective responsibility plan it is possible that some optout cases may not be transferred or otherwise included in mdl 1720 and will not be covered litigation see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan   to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report  

failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent the retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation the plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our ipo that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation see — if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages  in addition nonmonetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business see — limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability  therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation 

if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages  

like many other large companies we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competitionantitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others examples of such claims are described more fully in note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability accordingly we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings 

particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit such as the us or canadian merchant class action lawsuits monetary damages could be significant see note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

 15 

if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material pending or future legal proceedings we may have to pay substantial damages this could result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow and financial condition and could even cause us to become insolvent 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability  

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation we may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation for example under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation we have agreed among other things to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions in certain circumstances 

these and other settlements of or judgments in past pending and future litigation could force us to limit the rates we charge revise our rules about rates charged to consumers who use visabranded payment products or make other modifications to our business these modifications could materially and adversely affect our payments volume revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

tax examinations or disputes or changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments  

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 19—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

we have limited rights to enforce our agreement with visa europe which includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities  

in the event visa europe fails to meet its obligations under the framework agreement our remedies are limited we are unable to terminate the agreement even upon visa europes material uncured breach we also have a call option to acquire visa europe which can be triggered only under extremely limited circumstances see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

visa europe is obligated to indemnify visa inc and visa international service association visa international in connection with the european competition proceedings in our opinion including payment of any fines that may be imposed however visa europe has expressed an initial view that it is not obligated to indemnify visa inc or visa international for any claim in the european competition proceedings including claims asserted in both the european commission matter and the uk merchant litigation if visa europe continues in its refusal to indemnify us and we cannot enforce the indemnity we could be exposed to significant liabilities which would not be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan see note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

in addition under the framework agreement we may be required to indemnify visa europe for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their actions relating to the payments business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents engaged in the actions giving rise to such claims the indemnity obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities 

business risks 

the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits  

in order to stay competitive we offer incentives to clients to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand their visabranded card base these include upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased incentives marketing and other support payments we have continued to increase the use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states in 

 16 

addition we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing in situations where our products are coresident with other networks and merchants have a choice of network routing options 

the economic pressures on our clients arising from the doddfrank act have also increased our use of incentives see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business   as a result the provision of certain products and services may be less profitable or unprofitable which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 

pressure on client pricing also poses additional challenges for our business if we continue to increase incentives to our clients we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing the amount of feebased services we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from longterm contracts with certain clients including those that are large contributors to our revenue continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from maintaining such agreements in the future on the same or favorable terms we may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives and we may not succeed in these efforts 

intense competition in our industry may cause our business financial condition results of operations and prospects for future growth to suffer  

the global payments industry is intensely competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment these include cash checks and electronic and mobile transactions in addition our openloop payments network competes against other alternate payment systems such as closedloop systems the doddfrank act has increased this competitive pressure 

some of our competitors may develop substantially greater technology or have greater financial resources they may offer a wider range of programs products and services than we do including more innovative ones they may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments these include domestic networks in the united states china canada and australia they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other developments in many cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions 

traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services the risk to maintaining or securing our clients longterm commitments to our products has increased with the doddfrank acts restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector we do not have exclusivity with our largest clients such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstances our clients may terminate these relationships on relatively short notice despite significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of our clients this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations see note 13—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

we expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future for example 

  17 

 our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth 

disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business  

our position in the payments value chain is key to our business some of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternate payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without any intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model regulatory actions such as the doddfrank act may provide them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although other competitors are pursuing similar lines of business or adopting similar commercial models they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in us losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients which could materially and adversely affect our business revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth  

additional consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors or with one of our competitors directly this could result in the acquired financial institutions visa business shifting to a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business to us 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of new and existing clients and could increase their negotiating power this consolidation could lead new financial institution clients to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us in addition more consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volumebased discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth 

merchants continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement incentive arrangements and other initiatives  

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of visabranded payment cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuits if they continue we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses 

we also face competitive pressures on pricing we and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of visabranded payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions using both traditional and new technology platforms examples include closedloop payment systems that are specific to a single merchant or multimerchant solutions like the merchant customer exchange which is designed for a mobile 

 18 

platform and has many merchant participants such programs may offer unique or specialized benefits to consumers including discounts or customized offers if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our transaction volume 

all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues  

certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from growing our business and revenues 

failure to maintain relationships with issuers acquirers merchants and account holders and the failure of our financial institution clients to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business  

we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support and to compete effectively for our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these competitive card features for their customers 

in the wake of the doddfrank acts changes to the network exclusivity rules we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants acquirers and processors we already engage in many cobranding efforts in which we contract with merchants who directly receive incentive funding from us we also engage with merchants acquirers and processors to provide funding to promote routing and acceptance growth as these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships 

outside the united states some governments only permit their domestic processing which prohibits us from overseeing the endtoend processing of the transactions therefore we depend on our close working relationships with our clients in these regions to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving visabranded cards our inability to oversee the endtoend processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands 

in addition we depend on third parties to provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf and to the extent that such thirdparty vendors fail to perform or deliver adequate services our business and reputation could be impaired 

negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation which are key assets of our business  

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain account holders and financial institution clients to visabranded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industrys quality of service corporate responsibility use and protection of account holder data regulatory compliance financial condition and other factors negative perception or publicity particularly in light of the rapid widespread use of social media channels could cause damage to our brands and reputation our business may also be affected by actions taken by our clients other third parties or circumstances that are outside our control 

  19 

technology within its region visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money conducting research on brand performance promoting or maintaining the strength of our brands 

 any of these factors could require us to take on additional liabilities and costs result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny and materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have affected and are likely to continue to affect our clients merchants and account holders and may potentially impact our prospects profitability revenue and overall business  

the current threats to economic growth include geopolitical instability in the middle east which could affect oil prices economic fragility in the eurozone and in the united states potential reduction or tapering of bond purchases by the us federal reserve higher interest rates hurting the housing markets persistently weak job creation political discord spending cuts and debt defaults while there continues to be some improvements in advanced economies emerging economies continue to suffer with slower growth consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt levels excess housing inventory deflation changes in savings rates continued equity market volatility decreased export activity lowered government spending and additional government intervention furthermore continued challenges in the credit environment bank instability downgrades of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issues affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policies all must be considered 

the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments or crises were to arise around the world these include defaults on government debt exhaustion of national economic stimulus packages significant increases in oil prices tax increases a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps most recently the economic situations in the united states and various countries in europe have been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of debt defaults if such defaults occur or if the measures taken to avert such defaults create their own instability economic turmoil is likely to result and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant 

the volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economies and the responses by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones these include the following 

  20 

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and in multicurrency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions  

we generate a significant amount of our revenues from crossborder transactions and our clients pay us fees in connection with them some of those fees differ when conversion from the merchants currency to the issuers billing currency is required thus revenue from processing crossborder transactions for our clients fluctuates with crossborder activity and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency 

in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients settlement in different currencies a reduction in multicurrency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multicurrency transactions as a result of regulation litigation competitive pressures or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues 

crossborder travel may be adversely affected by global geopolitical economic social and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism social or political instability natural disasters effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases the need for conversion of currencies declines as crossborder travel is impacted which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

moreover if our clients decide to change practices eg prohibit certain transactions or increase account holder fees associated with crossborder transactions there could be a decline in account holder spending because their value proposition to the consumer could be reduced 

transactions outside the united states represent an increasingly important part of our strategy which we hope will continue to grow however a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and multicurrency transactions will decrease the number of crossborder transactions we process and our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected 

we risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications  

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement while the term and amount of our indemnification obligations have no limit our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time 

concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of

operations in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses and materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we estimate settlement exposure under the indemnity based on the sum of three inputs the first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin the second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume the third is the total balance for outstanding visa travelers cheques we generally guarantee the payment of any validly issued visa travelers cheque that has been negotiated in good faith and properly presented for payment in the event that the cheque is not honored by its issuing institution additionally from time to time we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary see note 11—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services or with new laws and regulations the use of our products our revenues and net income could decline  

rapid significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry these include developments in smart cards ecommerce mobile and radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industrywide standards new laws and regulations resistance to change from clients or merchants or third parties intellectual property rights our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or compromised the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected  

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunctions fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in longdistance or local telecommunications access fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks effects of climate change or other catastrophic events 

in addition our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks the latter could include computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denialofservice attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties equipment and data they could also compromise data security see — account data breaches involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues  if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded finally potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks 

additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability 

 22 

account data breaches involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues  

our clients merchants other service providers and we process store or transmit account holder information in connection with visabranded cards and payment products in addition our clients may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems processing storing or transmission of sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visabranded cards reputational damage and claims against us if we are sued in connection with any material data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of visabranded cards which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our compliance costs 

an increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving visabranded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of visabranded cards or payment products  

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture account holder information they use this information to conduct fraudulent transactions and to engage in other forms of illegal activities involving our payment products outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing as a result more third parties are involved in processing transactions using visabranded cards or payment products a rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving visabranded cards or payment products could lead to reputational damage to our brands this could reduce the use and acceptance of visabranded cards and payment products or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs and materially and adversely affect our payments volume and revenues 

failure to maintain interoperability with visa europes systems could damage the business and global perception of the visa brands  

visa and visa europe maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement systems as a result we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories regardless of where it originates visa europes independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to increasing costs and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products between visa europe and us could negatively affect account holders from visa europe using payment products in the countries we serve or our account holders using payment products in visa europes region failure to authorize clear and settle interterritory transactions quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brands 

structural and organizational risks 

due to the nature of our relationship and the terms we have agreed to with visa europe we have little ability to control its operations in its region and as a result we may experience added costs and challenges in operating our business  

visa europes exclusive license of our trademarks and technologies under the framework agreement gives us little ability to control and oversee visa europes operations in its region if we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that may be viewed as unfavorable to visa europe and its members visa europe is not required to implement the changes unless we agree to pay for the associated costs this may result in added costs and expenses to our business furthermore the licenses granted under the framework agreement may raise licensing payment and associated tax treatment concerns 

visa europe may hinder our ability to acquire new businesses or to operate them effectively in its region if the acquired business has operations in visa europes region visa europe may play a significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decisions and costs there finally visa europe may undertake operational and litigation strategies including but not limited to our ongoing litigation in the uk and our ongoing case with the european commission that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally 

if visa europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock under its put option we are likely to incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income  

 23 

we have granted visa europe a put option which visa europe can exercise at any time and which would require us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from visa europes members within 285 days we are likely to incur a financial obligation of several billion dollars or more and may need to obtain thirdparty financing in order to meet our obligation through the issuance of either debt or equity an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price with our stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

we may also encounter difficulties in integrating visa europes business and systems into our existing operations if we cannot do so quickly and costeffectively the integration could divert the time and resources of senior management disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we would become subject to any ongoing or future regulatory disputes as a result of eu regulations that govern the operations of visa europe 

we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis we record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations consequently the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these changes in the fair value of the put option could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and increase any associated costs 

if we cannot remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment  

we continue to centralize our management and operations for us to succeed organizationally we must effectively integrate our operations actively work to ensure consistency throughout our enterprise and incorporate a global perspective into our decisions and processes if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory 

in addition if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our risks execute our strategy and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed we may not be successful in this competitive economic and regulatory environment 

we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees  

our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets by key management and other key employees which could adversely affect our business 

acquisitions strategic investments and entries into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations  

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses products or technologies we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them we are also subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in visa europes territory which will impact our ability to expand or conduct business in those regions regulatory constraints particularly competition regulations may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments 

furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on acquisitions or investments that do not increase our revenues although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that they will be successful 

with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisitions or through organic development these include digital ecommerce and mobile payments our recent entry into these businesses requires additional 

 24 

resources and presents an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our operations and results 

future sales of our class a common stock or the end of transfer restrictions on our class b common stock could result in dilution to holders of our existing class a common stock which could adversely affect their rights and depress the market price of our class a common stock  

the market price and voting power of our class a common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding the market price of our class a common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur such as upon the issuance or conversion of certain securities to shares of our class a common stock under the retrospective responsibility plan specifically upon the final resolution of our covered litigation all class b common stock will become convertible into class a common stock 

if funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class a common stock will be diluted  

under our retrospective responsibility plan funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us at that time each share of class b common stock will become convertible into shares of class a common stock benefiting the holders of class b common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holders of class a common stock the amount of funds released and the market price of our class a common stock will determine the extent of the dilution 

holders of our class b and c common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class a common stock  

although their voting rights are limited holders of our class b and c common stock can vote on certain significant transactions these include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required under delaware law the holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with holders of class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control  

provisions contained in our current certificate of incorporation in our current bylaws and under delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable for instance except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance in addition except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to visa members as defined in our current certificate of incorporation no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis 

our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows  

since august 2008 we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class a b and c common stock the payment of dividends if any is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including but not limited to our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant if as a result of these factors we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to pay dividends to our stockholders furthermore if a dividend is declared or paid an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses financial institutions and governments around the world to fast secure and reliable electronic payments we provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of visabranded payment products including credit debit and prepaid we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions merchants consumers businesses and government entities each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic forms of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities particularly outside the united states we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide 

overall economic conditions  our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal 2013 reflects the impacts of a slowmoving global economic recovery 

interchange multidistrict litigation on october 19 2012 visa mastercard various us financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation the court entered the preliminary approval order of the settlement agreement on november 27 2012 on december 10 2012 visa paid approximately 40 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes however have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed optout claims until the settlement agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated no assurance can be provided that visa will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs’ claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement we also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the interchange multidistrict litigation for coordination of pretrial proceedings pursuant to the settlement agreement we paid 350 million from the litigation escrow account to the individual merchants on october 29 2012 and on november 6 2012 the court entered an order dismissing the individual merchants claims with prejudice see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

reduction in asconverted shares  during fiscal 2013  we repurchased 33 million  shares of our class a common stock using 54 billion  of cash on hand in july 2013 our board of directors authorized a 15 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through july 2014 as of september 30 2013 the july program had remaining authorized funds of 251 million  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to july 2013 have been completed in october 2013  our board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion  share repurchase program 

adjusted financial results our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the prior or future years as they either are nonrecurring have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan as such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 

  31 

 the following tables present our adjusted financial results for the years ended september 30 2012 and 2011 there were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013 





 nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues compared to the prior year overall payments volume grew in all categories worldwide except us consumer debit which has been negatively impacted by the doddfrank act beginning april 1 2012 the number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency 

 32 

the following tables present nominal payments volume 1   

  

 the table below provides the number of transactions processed by our visanet system and billable transactions processed by cybersources network during the fiscal periods presented 1   

 33 



 results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visabranded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services as well as the number of transactions processed on our network we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by account holders on visabranded cards or payment products our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants and establishing and earning these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues  consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of visabranded payment products and solutions current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our financial institution clients globally and with visa europe data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by cybersources online payment gateway platform  data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered 

international transaction revenues  are earned for crossborder transaction processing and currency conversion activities crossborder transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant international transaction revenues are primarily generated by crossborder payments and cash volume 

other revenues  consist mainly of license fees for use of the visa brand revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement fees from account holder services licensing and certification and other activities related to our acquired entities other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended account holder protection and concierge services   

client incentives consist of longterm contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visabranded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel includes salaries incentive compensation sharebased compensation fringe benefits and contractor expense 

network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

 34 

marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions of the visa brand 

professional fees  mainly consist of fees for consulting legal and other professional services 

depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software also included in this amount is amortization of finitelived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions 

general and administrative  mainly consists of travel activities facilities costs foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business 

litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile the specifics of the cases advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date 

nonoperating income 

nonoperating income mainly includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions income gains and losses earned on investments and the change in the fair value of the visa europe put option 

visa inc fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the united states internationally and from visa europe revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements 



 the increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume processed transactions and crossborder volume operating revenue growth also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services these benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the united states during the second half of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the doddfrank act 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars the effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2013 as partially mitigated by our hedging program resulted in an overall decline of about one percentage point in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2012 while we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2014  a general strengthening of the us dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2014 net of offsetting hedges see note 12—derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements 

 35 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues 

 

 36 

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses 



 nonoperating income 

nonoperating income in fiscal 2013  of 18 million  decreased from 68 million  in fiscal 2012  primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012  of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense see note 19—income taxes  and note 20—legal matters   

 37 

to our consolidated financial statements the decrease in fiscal 2012  from 200 million  in fiscal 2011  was primarily due to 

 effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate of 31 in fiscal 2013  differs from the effective income tax rates of 3 and 36 in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively mainly due to 

 

adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012  our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in that or future years as they were either nonrecurring had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan as such we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense additional covered litigation provision recorded and a onetime noncash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the california state apportionment rules 



liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 38 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 

  

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was lower during fiscal 2013  compared to prior year reflecting payments from the litigation escrow account totaling 44 billion  in connection with the covered litigation as these payments were made from our litigation escrow account they were also reflected as cash inflows under financing activities see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements the tax deduction related to these payments contributed to the 15 billion  decline in overall income taxes paid during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year absent the above impacts cash provided by operating activities would have totaled 59 billion  an increase over fiscal 2012 reflecting continued growth in operating revenues we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting higher operating revenues in fiscal 2012 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year reflecting a decrease in purchases of availableforsale investment securities combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of availableforsale investment securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was relatively consistent reflecting our continued investment in availableforsale securities 

financing activities cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the asconverted class a share count either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow and increased dividends cash used in financing activities also reflects cash inflows relating to payments made in connection with the covered litigation from the litigation escrow account see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  note 14—stockholders equity  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements our access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled 43 billion  at september 30 2013  if it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use 

 39 

in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries which we estimate to be approximately 38 billion  it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in the united states 

availableforsale investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 28 billion  are classified as noncurrent as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however these investments are generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment see item 1a—risk factors  included elsewhere in this report 

commercial paper program  we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes on february 7 2013  we replaced the existing 500 million  program with a new commercial paper program under the new program we are authorized to issue up to 30 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance we had no outstanding obligations under the new program at september 30 2013  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements 

credit facility on january 31 2013  we entered into an unsecured 30 billion  revolving credit facility this credit facility which expires on january 30 2014 replaced our existing 30 billion  credit facility which would have expired on february 15 2013  the new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type there were no borrowings under the new credit facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants at september 30 2013  see note 9—debt  to our consolidated financial statements

litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation will be payable when we fund the litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2013  was 49 million  and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2013  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions during fiscal 2013  however we were only required to fund settlementrelated working capital on a few days including a peak net settlement receivable balance of 36 million our average daily net settlement position was a payable of 198 million 

covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account during fiscal 2013  we made 44 billion  in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account of which 40 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation under the settlement agreement if class members opt out of the damages portion of the class settlement defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of no more than 25 of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out see note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements upon final court approval of the settlement agreement visas portion of the takedown payments calculated to be 11 billion  will increase our current taxable income the resulting increase in our current taxable income will increase our deferred tax asset and income tax payable by 387 million which will have a negative impact on our free cash flow in the year the final court approval is rendered see note 19—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements at september 30 2013  the litigation escrow account had an available balance of 49 million  see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan   to our consolidated financial statements 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs 

reduction in asconverted shares  during fiscal 2013  we repurchased 33 million  shares of our class a common stock using 54 billion  of operating cash on hand at september 30 2013 we had 251 million  of remaining funds available for share repurchases under the current program authorized by the board of directors in october 2013  our board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion  share repurchase program see note 14—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements 

dividends  during fiscal 2013  we paid 864 million  in dividends in october 2013  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 040  per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 255 million  in connection with this dividend on december 3 2013  see note 14—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by our board of directors classes of b and c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

visa europe put option we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies visa incs forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 

 the fair value of the put option represents the value of visa europes option which under certain conditions could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value at september 30 2013  we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately 145 million  while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2013  it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollars or more we may

need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things visa europes adjusted sustainable income and our pe ratio in each case as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 

given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purposes only a range of pe ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates 100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the 100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september 30 2013  or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise its option we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a forprofit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and as a result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated pe ratios for each 25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed 100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september 30 2013  our estimated longterm pe ratio was 169 x and the longterm pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe was 19 x at september 30 2013  the spot pe ratio was 215 x and the spot pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe was 11 x these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future 



 pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service age and eligible compensation we also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 4 million  88 million and 74 million respectively the lower contribution in fiscal 2013 was driven by a higherthanexpected rate of return on our plan assets during the year and an increase in the discount rate at september 30 2013 compared to september 30 2012 in fiscal 2014  given current projections and assumptions we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately 12 million  the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences see note 10—pension postretirement and other benefits  to our consolidated financial statements 

capital expenditures  our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2013  due to investments in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 

acquisitions there were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013  and 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 when we acquired playspan and fundamo for a total of 268 million net of 22 million in cash received we will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2013  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 60 billion  of assets and 160 million  of liabilities of these instruments 152 million  or 2  had significant unobservable inputs including the visa europe put option liability of 145 million  and 7 million  of auction rate securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

indemnifications 

we indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other clients to honor visabranded cards and payment products processed in accordance with our operating regulations the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see   note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 11—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2013 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities 



  43 

existing contracts or execution of new contracts related amounts disclosed in note 17—commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record 

 critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase visabranded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language eg early termination clauses managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentives not yet paid are accrued 

 44 

systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customerreported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenues as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2013  client incentives represented 16  of gross operating revenues 

fair value — visa europe put option 

critical estimates we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies our forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europes projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 

upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 

the fair value of visa europes option was estimated to be approximately 145 million  at september 30 2013  while the put option is in fact nontransferable this amount recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a thirdparty market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the terms of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a thirdparty market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option 

while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2013  it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollars or more see the liquidity and capital resources section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 

assumptions and judgment the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to as the pe differential 

probability of exercise— exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under its articles of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to i visa europes stated intentions ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results iii evaluation of market conditions including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europes largest members which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

 45 

pe differential— the pe differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward pricetoearnings multiples applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purposes the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors quantitatively we estimate our pe ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months the “longterm pe calculation” and the last 30 trading dates the “30day pe calculation” prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our longterm pricetoearnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30day pe calculation as compared to the longterm pe calculation in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences if any are the result of a fundamental change in our longterm value or the result of shortterm market volatility or other noncompany specific market factors that may not be indicative of our longterm forward pe we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that a market participant would more heavily weigh longterm value indicators as opposed to shortterm indicators 

factors that might indicate a fundamental change in longterm value include but are not limited to changes in the regulatory environment client portfolios longterm growth rates or new product innovations a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies 

other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise its option the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europes current business model as an association owned by its member banks while the highest reflect a successful shift to a forprofit model in anticipation of its exercise the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that should it choose to exercise its option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a forprofit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europes results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2013  we have assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated longterm pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19 x the use of a probability of exercise that is 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 18 million  in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million  in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe as such the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2013  classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

 46 

our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation the plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal 2013 see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 20—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 20—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the us dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the us dollar value of payments in foreign currencies primarily for expenses at our nonus locations we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated nonus dollar denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were 13 billion  and 739 million at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september 30 2013  is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10  change in the value of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately 85 million  on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2013  see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 12—derivative financial instruments   to our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

 47 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents and shortterm or longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity neither our operating results or cash flows have been nor are expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2013  and 2012  were 35 billion  and 30 billion  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately 38 million on our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2013  the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 11 billion  and 923 million  at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively 

visa europe put option 

we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september 30 2013  we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2013  we have assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19 x the use of a probability of exercise 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 18 million  in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million  in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 

pension plan risk 

our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 11 billion  and 973 million  and projected benefit obligations were 897 million  and 990 million  at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2014  if any which would be made in september 2014

controls and procedures 

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that as of september 30 2013  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures these limitations include the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable resource constraints in addition because we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions which we believe are reasonable about the likelihood of future events our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under all possible future conditions accordingly our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance but not absolute assurance of achieving their objectives 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

 we operate an openloop payments network a multiparty system in which visa connects issuing financial institutions or issuers that issue cards to cardholders and acquiring financial institutions or acquirers that have the banking relationship with merchants—and manage the exchange of information and value between them as such we do not issue cards extend credit or collect assess or set cardholder fees or interest charges in most instances cardholder and merchant relationships belong to and are managed by our network of financial institution clients we derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume transactions that we process and other related services that we provide 

business developments in fiscal 2012 included the following 

 4 

certification process for regulated issuers the program enables issuers to accurately register their exempt and nonexempt portfolios and to certify their compliance with these rules and criteria in july 2012 the federal reserve announced its final fraud prevention standards including clarifying the requirement that issuers notify their payment networks of their compliance with the final fraud standard rather than “certify” such compliance 

 industry overview 

we operate in the global payments industry which is undergoing a powerful secular shift towards electronic payments whether delivered in physical cardbased form or virtually via mobile or ecommerce platforms and away from paperbased payments such as cash and checks for more than 50 years we have played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers businesses governments and merchants we believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience security enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms we also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency control and security and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience   

the global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer including 

 5 

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which offer widespread merchant acceptance general purpose cards are typically categorized as 

 

primary card brands include visa mastercard american express jcb and discoverdiners club while these brands including visa were historically associated with consumer credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets we and others have over time broadened our offerings to include debit atm prepaid and commercial payment products 

our core operations 

we derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume transactions that we process and other related services we provide our clients deliver visa products and payment services to consumers and merchants based on product platforms we define and manage payments network management is a core part of our operations as it ensures that our payments system provides a safe efficient consistent and interoperable service to cardholders merchants and financial institutions worldwide

core processing services 

our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between visa issuers and acquirers in addition we offer a range of valueadded processing services to support our clients visa programs and to promote the growth and security of our payments network 

authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholders account the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies settlement is the process of calculating determining reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared 

the issuer and acquirer involved in a typical visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor for example the acquirer credits the merchants account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer in addition the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment in the case of a credit or deferred debit card or collects payment directly from the cardholders deposit account in the case of a debit card 

we process most visa transactions occurring in the united states we also process most visa transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries which we refer to as crossborder transactions in countries outside the united states processing of domestic visa transactions varies in some countries such as canada and brazil visa processes the majority of transactions in many other countries transactions may be processed outside of our systems generally by governmentcontrolled payments networks our clients independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our clients

product platform innovation 

our fundamental approach to innovation focuses on enhancing our current product platforms enabling more visa transactions in every channel and extending the utility of our products and services to access points such as ecommerce and mobile and new merchant segments and geographies we invest in innovation because we believe we can drive more secure accessible and versatile payment program options for clients merchants and consumers we focus on new payment channels payment technologies payment account access devices and authentication methods we have recently made significant investments in the development of ecommerce and mobile payment platforms contact and contactless chip cards and devices card product enhancements authentication and security technologies and platforms and money transfer we have the following initiatives 

 payments network management 

we devote significant resources to ensuring that visa is the payments network of choice for clients merchants and cardholders we seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities educating domestic and regulatory banking authorities on our capabilities increasing acceptance of visa products around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants 

brand management marketing and corporate reputation 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand taking a targeted analytical approach tailored by geography to achieve our growth and business objectives we combine advertising sponsorships promotions public relations and increasingly social media to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand promote product usage increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention for merchants we work to ensure that the visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment as well as a way to increase sales for our issuer clients our marketing program is designed to support their card issuance activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands 

sponsorship is a specific area where we have invested in developing global marketing relationships to promote the visa brand for instance we have been the exclusive payment services sponsor for the olympic games since 1986 and have extended that sponsorship through 2020 we are also one of six fifa partners providing us with worldwide exclusive access to the fifa world cup™ and more than 40 other fifa competitions these sponsorships create a powerful opportunity to drive business achieve maximum exposure and improve brand lift global reach and local relevance in addition we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional national and local companies sports leagues and events such as the national football league in the united states and with associations and companies to provide customized marketing platforms to clients in certain countries and regions 

our client and merchant marketing activities bring added value through the development of marketing programs designed to drive their specific business objectives for merchant clients these programs generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions for issuer clients our marketing programs support their card issuance activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands 

in addition we work on various fronts to maintain enhance and protect our corporate reputation and brand our corporate responsibility program helps ensure we positively impact the lives of those in our global and local communities we do so by expanding financial inclusion and literacy providing humanitarian aid and community support and engaging in responsible business practices we continue to promote an understanding of visas role as a payments network and articulate the ways that electronic payments can advance economic empowerment remove friction from commerce and increase government efficiencies to that end currency of progress our corporate reputation campaign launched in october 2009 communicates the tangible benefits that visa and electronic payments deliver to individuals businesses governments and economies 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

we aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fastgrowing segments such as bill payment our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations delivering valueadded information services and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment for example we raised the limit for our “no signature required” program from 25 to 50 for us discount stores and grocery storessupermarkets enabling more facetoface merchants to accept visa cards for transactions without requiring a cardholder signature pin or providing a receipt unless requested by the cardholder this program can increase speed at the point of sale enhance consumer satisfaction and deliver operating efficiencies for merchants 

we also enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our products 

client standards 

rulemaking and enforcement in general our clients are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems our clients are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with and in certain cases nonequity membership interests in our subsidiaries these rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks the standards design and features of payment cards devices and programs processing merchant acquiring activities including use of agents disputes between members risk management settlement indemnification client financial failures and allocation of losses among clients 

we establish and administer dispute management procedures between clients relating to specific transactions for example after a transaction is presented to an issuer the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons including fraud if the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction the issuer may return the transaction to the acquirer an action termed a “chargeback” we enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes 

credit risk management we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify clients even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system we have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years see item 1a—risk factors—we risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications   

to manage our exposure in the event our clients fail to fund their settlement obligations we established a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures we regularly evaluate clients with significant settlement exposure to assess risk in certain instances we may require a client to post collateral or provide other guarantees if a client becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss we may also apply other risk control measures such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions limiting the use of certain types of agents prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain highrisk merchants or suspending or terminating a clients rights to participate in our payments network the exposure to settlement losses through our indemnification 

is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients using where available thirdparty estimates of the probability of customer failure see item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 12—settlement guarantee management  elsewhere in this report 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products fraud is most often committed in connection with counterfeit cards or cardnotpresent transactions using stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems not associated with visanet that store process or transmit cardholder or account data including systems operated by merchants financial institutions and other thirdparty data processors 

our fraud detection and prevention offerings include 

 we work with all participants in the payment system to ensure that any entity that transmits processes or stores sensitive card information takes necessary steps to secure that data and protect cardholders for example we mandate protection of pin data through use of the triple data encryption standard and work with the payments industry to manage the payment card industry data security standards pci dss there has been significant progress in growing industry adoption of pci dss with more than 97 percent of the largest us merchants validating compliance annually 

government regulation 

general  government regulation affects key aspects of our business our clients are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and consequently such regulations have the potential to affect our business indirectly in recent years our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny see item 1a—risk factors—increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues  

the doddfrank act  as noted during the 2011 fiscal year the us federal reserve established new rules under the doddfrank  act affecting interchange reimbursement fees network exclusivity and transaction routing we expect these rules which include provisions effective in our fiscal 2012 and 2013 to continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of us debit payments we process and decrease associated revenues see item 1a—risk factors—the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business   and   item 7—managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview  we have significantly modified our debit strategy as a result see — overview  

interchange reimbursement fees we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the united states and many other geographies the new rules under the doddfrank act set the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying a fraud adjustment of up to an additional one cent this amounts to a significant reduction from the average systemwide fees charged previously see item 1a—risk factors—the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  and   item 1a—risk factors—additional regulation of interchange 

reimbursement fees may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

the united states is not the only jurisdiction to regulate debit interchange reimbursement fees for example the reserve bank of australia has enacted a regulation limiting the costs that can be considered in setting interchange reimbursement fees for both our credit and our debit cards 

interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated from products in our payments system we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process 

default interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume and value they promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by giving our clients an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and ultimately consumers and merchants we believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers merchants our financial institution clients and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment and by creating incentives for innovation enhanced data quality and security 

merchants do not directly pay interchange reimbursement fees a merchants cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate the merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in openloop payments networks including those relating to interchange and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant clients and are established in competition with other acquirers other payment card systems and other forms of payment we do not establish or regulate the level of merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers in some cases such as india the governing authorities have regulated the merchant discount rate itself rather than the interchange reimbursement fee 

network exclusivity and routing  we have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition issuers of some debit products outside the united states have historically chosen to include only the visa network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity the doddfrank act limits our and issuers ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see item 1a— the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

as another example the canadian ministry of finance has implemented a voluntary code of conduct for payment card industry participants with which visa has agreed to comply among other things the code of conduct prohibits certain restrictions on merchants choice of payment options they will accept see item 1a—risk factors—additional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transactions we process materially and adversely affecting our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

consumer financial protection bureau the doddfrank act created a new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent the bureaus future actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers consumers and merchants by further regulating the industry 

nosurcharge rules  we have historically implemented policies that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa instead of other means some local jurisdictions have taken steps to limit these nosurcharge rules for example the reserve bank of australia enacted a regulation that prohibited us from enforcing our nosurcharge policy and effectively allowed merchants to impose discretionary surcharges on visa 

transactions without limitation recently the reserve bank of australia while reinforcing its position that surcharging is appropriate in that market has taken steps that would allow us to limit the level of surcharges that merchants can impose additionally in the united states there are ten states that prohibit the use of the surcharge as an anticonsumer practice through their state legislatures 

data protection and information security  we devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine our information security program in order to comply with us federal and state and foreign regulations safeguarding cardholder information and requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach in addition the us federal financial institution examination council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the united states to examine our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirements and standards as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctioned countries  in response to us and other regulations we devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine a program to prevent the use of our payments system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities we also prohibit from being visa members all financial institutions that are domiciled in countries sanctioned by the us treasurys office of foreign assets control—currently cuba iran syria and sudan in addition we refrain from any financial dealings with restricted third parties such as identified moneylaundering fronts for terrorists and narcotics traffickers 

governmentimposed market participation influences and restrictions  our businesss reach remains limited by certain governments influence on domestic payments competition andor protection of domestic payment card providers or payment processing providers most notably none of our financial institution clients in china have received authorization to issue cards carrying only our brands for domestic use in china limiting our opportunities in that market regulators in an increasing number of countries around the world including recently thailand ukraine the uae mexico colombia and russia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries 

regulation of internet transactions  many jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of adopting new regulations and taxes on internet transactions most notably we have had to implement compliance programs in response to new us regulations requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions 

in addition the us congress continues to consider regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our clients some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our clients to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes 

various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would affect our clients directly these new requirements and developments may affect our clients ability to extend credit by using payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our clients ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters we own numerous valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands products programs and services which are essential to our business in multiple countries including but not limited to visa interlink plus visa electron the “winged v” design and the “dove” design through agreements with our clients we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment including paperbased forms principally cash and checks cardbased payments including credit charge debit atm prepaid privatelabel and 

other types of general purpose and limiteduse cards ecommerce and mobilebased platforms and other electronic payments including wire transfers electronic benefits transfers automatic clearing house or ach payments and electronic data interchange 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution clients and their cardholder merchants the leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are visa mastercard american express and diners club other general purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the united states in certain countries our competitors have leading positions such as unionpay in china which remains the sole domestic interbank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in china we also compete against privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or other merchant 

in the debit card market segment visa and mastercard are the primary global brands in addition our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands including star nyce and pulse in the united states eftpos in australia nets in singapore and interac in canada in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by mastercard and many of the online debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands are the primary brands and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume 

as the payments landscape evolves we may increasingly face competition from emerging players in the payment space many of which are nonfinancial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional “bankcentric” business model the emergence of these potentially competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on ecommerce andor mobile technologies paypal google and isis are examples these providers compete with visa directly in some cases yet may also be significant partners and customers of visa   

based on payments volume total volume and number of transactions visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world the following chart compares our network with those of our major general purpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2011 



 sources mastercard american express jcb and diners club data sourced from the nilson report issue 992 april 2012 includes all consumer and commercial credit debit and prepaid cards some prior year figures have been restated currency figures are in us dollars mastercard excludes maestro and cirrus figures american express includes figures for thirdparty issuers jcb figures include thirdparty issuers and other paymentrelated products some figures are estimates diners club figures are for the 12 months ended november 30 2011 discover data sourced from the nilson report issue 986 january 2012 — us data only and includes business from thirdparty issuers 

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 14—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  included elsewhere in   this report 

working capital requirements 

payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents a substantial daily working capital requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2012  or fiscal 2011  accounted for more than 30 of our fiscal 2012  or fiscal 2011  operating revenues 

employees 

at september 30 2012  we employed approximately 8500  persons worldwide we consider our relationships with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

regulatory risks 

additional regulation of interchange reimbursement fees may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in a payments network such as ours in connection with transactions initiated with products in our payments system interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers—the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders the fees are typically paid by acquirers—the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants we refer to a system like ours in which a payment network intermediates between the issuer and the acquirer as an openloop system 

we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees can substantially affect our revenues and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification 

we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the united states and many other geographies however in certain jurisdictions interchange rates and related practices are subject to continuing or increased government regulation the doddfrank act has already resulted in limitations on our ability to establish default interchange rates in the debit area in the united states see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  in addition interchange rates have become subject to continued or increased scrutiny elsewhere 

and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates these jurisdictions include australia canada brazil and south africa 

when we cannot set default interchange rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers find our payments system less attractive this lowers overall transaction volume and slows growth of transactions it also may increase the attractiveness of closedloop payments systems—those with direct connections to both merchants and consumers—and other forms of payment in addition we believe some issuers are charging new or higher fees to consumers in some instances this makes our card programs less desirable and reduces our transaction volumes and profitability some acquirers elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer visa cardholders to alternate payment systems in addition some issuers and acquirers have obtained and may continue to obtain incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs for these reasons additional regulation of interchange reimbursement fees may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

additional regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transactions we process materially and adversely affecting our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

in order to give visabranded cardholders a consistent experience we promote certain practices to ensure that visabranded cards are processed over our network we have historically had agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition certain issuers of some products have historically chosen to include only the visa network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity 

in addition certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks coreside on visa debit cards for example visas rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through visanet and that a member must clear international transactions through visanet these are commonly referred to as routing rules 

the doddfrank act already limits our and issuers ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  future regulations like the doddfrank act in the united states and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transactions we process in order to retain that transaction volume we would have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers or acquirers or directly to merchants any of these eventualities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  

as of october 1 2011 in accordance with the doddfrank act the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange fee charged by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to a significant reduction from the average systemwide fees charged previously the federal reserve also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

these regulations have adversely affected our us debit business and associated revenues they created negative pressure on our pricing reduced the volume and number of us debit payments we process and diminished associated revenues and although we believe we have now absorbed their principal impact they could continue to do so 

these pressures have arisen through various channels a number of our clients obtained fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue some reduced the number of debit cards they issue and investments they make in marketing and rewards programs some imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships some elected to issue fewer cards enabled with visaaffiliated networks many merchants have used the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks 

based on lowest cost or other factors other clients and merchants are likely to take similar actions in the future 

the doddfrank act created a new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent although the bureaus future actions may benefit consumers these actions may also make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures payment card practices fees routing and other matters with respect to credit debit and prepaid 

some elements of the doddfrank act lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the regulation our interpretation may result in our pursuit of strategies less effective than those of our competitors 

overall the regulations and developments arising from the doddfrank act could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

new regulations or legal action in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products  

regulators around the world increasingly note each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another the doddfrank act is one development with such potential similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations like those affecting debit payments could eventually spread to regulate credit 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment these include matters like interchange reimbursement fees network exclusivity preferred routing dynamic currency conversion point of sale transaction rules and practices and operating regulations conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services and fees and other important aspects of our business either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenues  

governments in some countries provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks brands and processing providers these governments may take this action in order to support these providers they may also take this action to keep us from entering these countries to force us to leave or to restrict substantially our activities there for example the government of china continues to maintain regulations that substantially favor china union pay the only retail payments network currently operating in the chinese domestic market additionally governments in some countries may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments entirely in that country this would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our clients our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and our revenues  

recently privacy data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states and elsewhere for example in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach these measures may increase our and our clients costs they may also decrease the number of visabranded cards our clients issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands 

increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues  

regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities similarly the impact of such regulations on our clients may reduce the volume of payments we process moreover such regulations can limit the types of products and services that we offer the countries in which our cards are used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards any of these occurrences can materially and adversely affect our business prospects for future growth financial condition and results of operations 

examples include 

 litigation risks 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments   

our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation which is described in note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offerings of our shares of class a common stock or deposits of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offerings they also include a loss sharing agreement and a judgment sharing agreement in addition our us members are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to visa usas certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique complicated and tiered and if we cannot use one or 

more of them this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

the principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement fees since 2005 approximately 55 class actions and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against us mastercard andor other defendants including certain financial institutions that issue visabranded payment cards and acquire visabranded payment transactions in the us we refer to this as the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegations the plaintiffs have alleged that visas setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws the lawsuits were transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york 

the plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled 

the allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february 7 2011 see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 21—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report the visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan 

the companys litigation escrow account currently contains an amount that covers our exposure in the interchange litigation as negotiated with the class plaintiffs on october 19 2012 we signed settlement agreements in these cases including an agreement to pay approximately 4 billion to the class plaintiffs the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement with the class plaintiffs on november 9 2012 however the agreement with the class plaintiffs remains subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeals we cannot assure that the court will provide final approval of the settlement or that we will win any appeals 

failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows such a failure could even cause us to become insolvent the retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation the plan generally does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation see — if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages  in addition nonmonetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business see — limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability  therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our obligations with respect to monetary liabilities from settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation it will not insulate us from the monetary impact of all litigation 

if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages   

like many other large companies we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competitionantitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others examples of such claims are described more fully in note 21—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damages accordingly we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings 

private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us this is particularly so in cases involving merchants and consumers due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit such as the united states or canadian merchant class action lawsuits monetary damages could be significant see note 21—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future legal proceedings we may have to pay substantial damages this could result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow and financial conditions and could even cause us to become insolvent 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability   

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation we may also have to change our business practices in response to pending or future litigation for example in the pending settlement agreement in the interchange litigation we have agreed among other things to permit merchants to add surcharges to credit transactions under certain circumstances 

these and other settlements of or judgments in past pending and future litigation could force us to limit further the fees we charge to revise further our rules about fees charged to consumers who choose to pay with visa or to make other modifications to our business these modifications could materially and adversely affect our payments volume revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

tax examinations or disputes or changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments   

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future the tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material and adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 20—income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

our agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities   

under our framework agreement with visa europe we indemnify it for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their activities and relating to our or their payments business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents participated in the actions giving rise to such claims such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities 

business risks 

the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits   

we offer incentives to clients in order to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand our card base these include upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased incentives marketing support payments and other support over the past several years we have increased the use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states 

in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives the economic pressures on our clients arising from the doddfrank act have increased this pressure see — the doddfrank act may continue to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business   this pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 

pressure on client pricing also poses indirect risks presenting the potential for the same adverse effects if we continue to increase incentives to our clients we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume the amount of feebased services we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from longterm contracts with certain clients including those that are large contributors to our revenue continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on favorable terms we may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives and we may not succeed in these efforts 

intense competition in our industry may cause our business financial condition results of operations and 

prospects for future growth to suffer   

the global payments industry is intensely competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment these include cash checks and electronic and mobile transactions in addition our payment programs compete against the cardbased payments systems of our competitors and privatelabel cards issued by merchants the doddfrank act has increased this competitive pressure 

some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have they may offer a wider range of programs products and services than we do including more innovative ones they may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do they may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements than we have 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments these include domestic networks in the united states china canada australia and other countries and regions they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other developments in many cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions 

traditional or untraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services the risk to maintaining or securing our clients longterm commitments to our products has increased with the doddfrank acts restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector most of our larger client relationships are not exclusive these include those with our largest clients jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstances our clients may terminate these relationships sometimes on relatively short notice and in many cases subject to significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations see note 14—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

we expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future for example 

 our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth 

disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business   

our position in the payments value chain underpins our business certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and no intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model the doddfrank act and other regulatory actions have provided and may in the future provide them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although they pursue the same or similar lines of business using the same or similar business and commercial models they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments for example merchants could process 

transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients materially and adversely affecting our business revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth   

in the recent past the banking industry experienced substantial accelerated consolidation this could happen again significant consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors this could result in the acquired banks visa business shifting to that competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business to us in addition one or more of our clients could merge with or acquire one of our competitors shifting its payments volume to that competitor 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of our clients and potential clients and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining clients and potential clients this consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us in addition more consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volumebased discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business revenues results of operations and prospects for future growth 

merchants continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangements   

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry some merchants have sought to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation if they continue these efforts could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

we and our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of our payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants this could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues   

certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our clients which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

failure to maintain relationships with our clients merchant acquirers merchants and vendors and the failure of clients to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business   

we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our clients and on their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if any or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features with the exception of several large merchants historically we have generally not solicited merchants directly to accept our cards as a result the success of our business has depended significantly on and will continue to depend on the continued success and competitiveness of our clients and the strength of our relationships with them 

in the wake of the doddfrank acts changes to rules on network exclusivity we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants and merchant acquirers and processors we 

already engage in many cobranding efforts in which we contract with the merchant who directly receives incentive funding we also engage with merchants and merchant acquirers and processors to provide funding to promote routing and acceptance growth as these and other relationships take on a greater importance for both merchants and us our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships 

in many countries outside the united states our clients or other processors authorize clear and settle most domestic transactions using our payment cards without involving our processing systems this pattern is increasing with a rise in new systems endorsed by governments in addition we historically have not generally had direct relationships with merchants there and shifting technology and development may further increase such activity we do not have direct relationships with cardholders consequently we depend on our close working relationships with our clients to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving our cards our inability to control the endtoend processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands 

in addition we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf and to the extent that thirdparty vendors fail to deliver services our business and reputation could be impaired 

the perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation which are key assets of our business   

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to visabranded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our clients that change the perception of our brands from time to time our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be subject to challenge which may materially and adversely affect our business further visa europe has very broad latitude to operate the visa business in and use our brands and technology within visa europes region in which we have only limited control over the operation of the visa business visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the visa brands in its region and the strength of the visa global brands depends in part on the efforts of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny finally because we are domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients merchants and cardholders resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business   

unprecedented economic events that began in 2008 continue to affect the financial markets around the world these include decreased consumer spending increased unemployment deflation increased savings decreased consumer debt excess housing inventory lowered government spending decreased export activity continued challenges in the credit environment continued equity market volatility additional government intervention bank instability downgrades of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issues affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policies this economic turmoil has affected the economies of europe the united states and other mature economies in particular 

the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments were to arise these include defaults on government debt exhaustion of us and other national economic stimulus packages significant increases in oil prices tax increases a significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy missteps most recently the economic situation in europe has been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of a default by greece portugal spain and other nations on their debt obligations if such a default occurs or if the measures taken to avert such a default create their own instability economic turmoil is likely to result and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant in addition the socalled “fiscal cliff” in the united states—the combination of expiring tax cuts and mandatory reductions in federal spending at the end of 2012—has the potential to have an impact on the economy and the stock market 

the severity of the economic environment and the response by financial institutions and governments may create new risks or increase the impact of existing ones these include the following 

 23 

 some existing clients have been placed in receivership or under government administration many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential changes in laws and regulations many of our clients merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely affected any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and in multicurrency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions   

we generate a significant amount of our revenues from crossborder transactions and our clients pay us fees in connection with them some of those fees differ when conversion from the merchants currency to the cardholders billing currency is required thus revenue from processing crossborder transactions for our clients fluctuates with crossborder activity and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency 

in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients settlement in different currencies a reduction in multicurrency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multicurrency transactions as result of regulation litigation competitive pressures or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues 

crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism natural disasters the effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a decline in the need for conversion of currencies might also adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

moreover if our clients decide to increase cardholder fees associated with crossborder transactions there could be a decline in cardholder spending since our value proposition to the consumer could be reduced 

transactions outside the united states represent an increasingly important part of our strategy in order to continue to grow in those areas we will need to ensure that we maintain consistency in the types of products we 

provide the quality of our service and the viability of our brand if we cannot employ our organizational resources effectively we will be unable to do so 

we risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations for which we have provided indemnifications   

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of our indemnification obligations are unlimited but restricted to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time 

concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients or several of our smaller clients may exceed our available financial resources as could systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses materially and adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we estimate settlement at risk or exposure based on the sum of three inputs the first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin the second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume the third is the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques additionally from time to time we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary see note 12—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our products could decline reducing our revenues and net income   

rapid significant technological changes continue to confront the payments industry these include developments in smart cards ecommerce mobile commerce and radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industrywide standards by resistance to change from clients or merchants or by third parties intellectual property rights our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we cannot process transactions efficiently the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected   

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in longdistance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism climate change or accident 

in addition our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks the latter could include computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing any of these incidents could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties equipment and data they could also compromise data security see —account data breaches involving card data stored by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and 

revenues  if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded finally potential and actual attacks could also result in increased costs both for recovery and for prevention against future attacks 

additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability 

account data breaches involving card data processed stored or transmitted by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues   

our clients merchants others and we process store or transmit cardholder account information in connection with visabranded payment cards in addition our clients may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems processing storing or transmitting sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visabranded cards to reputational damage and to claims against us if we are sued in connection with any material data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our costs 

an increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of our cards   

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information they use the information to conduct fraudulent transactions and to engage in other forms of illegal activities involving the payment system outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing as a result more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards a rise in fraud levels and other illegal activities involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands this could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or lead to greater regulation increasing our compliance costs 

failure to maintain interoperability between our and visa europes authorization and clearing and settlement systems could damage the business and global perception of the visa brands   

visa europe and we maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement systems as a result we have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories regardless of where it originates visa europes independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems failure to authorize or clear and settle interterritory transactions quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the visa brands 

structural and organizational risks 

we have little ability to control visa europes operations and limited recourse if it breaches its obligations to us   

visa europe has very broad rights to operate the visa business in its region under the agreement that governs our relationship if we want to change a global rule or to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for visa europe and its members then visa europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that visa europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation 

if visa europe fails to meet its obligations our remedies under this agreement are limited we cannot terminate the agreement even upon visa europes material uncured breach although we have a call right to acquire visa europe we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstances 

these and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of tax treatment of entry into the licenses and payments received thereunder 

in some instances as in the case of cybersource and playspan visa europe may have the right to control 

the activities of newly acquired entities within visa europes territory in any event visa europes license rights in europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entities or to operate them effectively 

any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we can provide could negatively affect cardholders from visa europe using cards in the countries we serve or our cardholders using cards in visa europes region 

if visa europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock we will incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income   

we have granted visa europe a put option requiring us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from its members if exercised we will incur a financial obligation of several billion dollars or more if visa europe exercises this option visa europe may do so at any time we may need to obtain thirdparty financing in order to meet our obligation by either borrowing funds or selling stock an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders we would have only 285 days to pay the exercise price sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8  of this report 

if visa europe exercises the put option we may encounter difficulties in integrating visa europes business and systems into our existing operations if we cannot do so quickly and costeffectively the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we would become subject to the many regulations of the european union that govern the operations of visa europe including any regulatory disputes 

we are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option we record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations consequently the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these changes could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the costs involved in raising it 

if we cannot remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment   

since our reorganization in october 2007 we have increasingly centralized our management and operations for us to succeed we must effectively integrate our operations actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization and incorporate a global perspective into our decisions and processes if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory 

in addition the current competitive economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges we may not be able to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly enough define our appetite for risk specifically enough execute our strategy seamlessly enough implement new governance managerial and organizational processes efficiently enough and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly enough 

we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees   

our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets adversely affecting our business 

acquisitions strategic investments and entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations   

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses products or technologies we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them the integration of cybersource playspan and fundamo all acquired recently will take time and resources that would otherwise have been available for other acquisitions we will be subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in the visa europe territory regulatory 

constraints particularly competition regulations may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments 

furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues moreover our cash reserves contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions and investments 

with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisition or through organic development these include electronic and mobile payments relative inexperience in such businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our operations and results 

future sales of our class a common stock or the end of transfer restrictions on our class b stock could result in dilution to holders of shares of our existing class a common stock adversely affecting their rights and depressing the market price of our class a common stock   

the market price and voting power of our class a common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding the market price of our class a common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur such as upon the issuance or conversion of securities convertible to shares of our class a common stock specifically upon the final resolution of our covered litigation all class b stock will become transferable at once 

if funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class a common stock will be diluted   

under our retrospective responsibility plan funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us at that time each share of class b common stock will become convertible into an increased number of shares of class a common stock benefiting the holders of class b common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest in visa inc held by the holders of class a common stock in this case the amount of funds released and the market price of our class a common stock will determine the extent of the dilution 

holders of our shares of our class b and c common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class a common stock   

although their voting rights are limited holders of shares of our class b and c common stock can vote on certain significant transactions these include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required by delaware law the holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control   

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable for instance except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance in addition except for common stock issued to a member in connection with our reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock shares held by a competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may not exceed 5 of our total outstanding shares on an asconverted basis 

our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows   

since august 2008 we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class a b and c common stock any future payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any would be at the discretion of our 

board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant if because of these factors we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may be unable to make payments of dividends of our common stock furthermore no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class of common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend this management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of visa inc and its subsidiaries “visa” “we” “our” and the “company” on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings as well as those factors that may affect future earnings the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 of this report  

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses financial institutions and governments around the world to fast secure and reliable electronic payments we provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit debit prepaid and commercial payments we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions merchants consumers businesses and government entities each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic forms of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities particularly outside the united states we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services we provide 

overall economic conditions and regulatory environment  our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal 2012 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery 

the doddfrank act  as of october 1 2011 in accordance with the doddfrank act the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to a significant reduction from the average systemwide interchange fees charged before the doddfrank act was implemented the federal reserve has also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

the interchange exclusivity and routing regulations have impacted our pricing reduced the number and volume of us debit payments we process and decreased associated revenues a number of our clients have sought fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue some have reduced the number of debit cards they issue and reduced investments they make in marketing and rewards programs some have imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demanddeposit account relationships some have elected to issue fewer cards enabled with visaaffiliated networks additionally the routing regulations have allowed merchants to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors 

we have had to reexamine and renegotiate certain of our client contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations and will continue to do so with others as a result our clients have sought and will continue to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees incentives and routing in some cases we may lose placement completely on issuers debit cards 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we began implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the doddfrank act to some extent by making pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network for fiscal 2012 the overall net impact of the doddfrank act including restructured pricing incentives other mitigation strategies and volume loss was a decrease of approximately 015 in diluted earnings per class a common share 

our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers we believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to electronic currency may help buffer the impacts of the doddfrank act as reflected in our overall payments volume growth particularly outside the united states as a leader in the us debit industry we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the doddfrank act and mitigate some of its negative impacts we remain committed and prepared to adapt to and compete effectively under this new us debit regulatory environment 

notice of proposed adjustment  on may 23 2012 the us internal revenue service the irs issued a notice of proposed adjustment nopa to our fiscal 2008 us federal income tax return seeking to disallow the 

deduction of settlement payments associated with the american express litigation made during that fiscal year however on august 15 2012 the irs issued a chief counsel advice cca supporting our position that visa is entitled to the deduction and subsequently the irs issued a revised revenue agent report rar effectively withdrawing the nopa the irs may still challenge any income tax return position taken including the deductibility of covered litigation payments made in fiscal 2008 or any future year until the statute of limitations has closed for each applicable year the statute of limitations for fiscal 2008 is expected to expire in june of 2013 however given the cca and revised rar during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal 2012 this increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by 627 million the reversal of tax reserves and related interest included 301 million related to reserves taken in the current year and 326 million related to reserves taken in previous years 

multidistrict litigation proceedings mdl  on october 19 2012 visa mastercard various us financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs claims in the interchange mdl we also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the mdl for coordination of pretrial proceedings the settlement with the class plaintiffs is subject to final court approval which we cannot assure will be received and to the adjudication of any appeals see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 21—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

adjusted financial results our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years as they either are nonrecurring have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan as such we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 

 the following table presents our adjusted financial results for the years ended september 30 2012 and 2011 



 reduction in asconverted shares  during fiscal 2012  total asconverted class a common stock was reduced by 228 million shares using 24 billion of operating cash on hand of the 24 billion 710 million  was used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market in addition we made deposits totaling 17 billion   of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan these deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class a common stock because they reduce the class b conversion rate and consequently the asconverted class a common stock share count 

in july 2012  our board of directors authorized a 1 billion  share repurchase program to be in effect through july 2013  as of september 30 2012 the program had remaining authorized funds of 865 million  in october 2012  our board of directors authorized an additional 15 billion  share repurchase program to be in effect through october 2013  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to july 2012 have been completed 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues and processed transactions are the primary driver for our data processing revenues compared to the prior year overall payments volume increased as a result of continuing doubledigit percentage growth in consumer credit and commercial payments volume worldwide these increases were moderated by an anticipated deceleration in consumer debit growth primarily due to the impacts of the doddfrank act excluding us debit transactions which reflect the impacts of the doddfrank act the number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency 

the following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars 1  



  

 the table below provides the number of transactions processed by our visanet system and billable transactions processed by cybersources network during the fiscal periods presented 



 results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visabranded cards for goods and services as well as the number size and type of transactions processed on our payment processing platforms we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest or fees paid by cardholders on visabranded cards our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining the interest rates and fees paid by cardholders and most other competitive card features we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance by the issuing bank including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants establish and earn these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues  consist primarily of revenues earned for providing clients with a supported global business infrastructure and for services which support the various product platforms that enable clients to deliver visa products and payment services current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement transaction processing services network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and visa europe data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by cybersources online payment gateway and playspans virtual goods payment platform  data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered 

international transaction revenues  are earned for processing crossborder transactions and currency conversion activities crossborder transactions arise when the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country international transaction revenues are generally driven by crossborder payments and cash volume 

other revenues  consist primarily of license fees for use of the visa brand revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement fees from cardholder services licensing and certification and certain activities related to our acquired entities other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services   

client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel includes salaries incentive compensation stockbased compensation fringe benefits and contractor expense 

network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our processing network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the visa brand 

professional fees consist of fees for consulting legal and other professional services 

depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software also included in this amount is amortization of finitelived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions 

general and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business 

litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile the specifics of the cases advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates 

other income expense 

interest income expense primarily includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions 

investment income  represents returns on our fixedincome securities and other investments investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other investments 

other nonoperating income primarily relates to gains and losses earned on equity method investments and the change in the fair value of the visa europe put option 

visa inc fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the united states in the rest of the world and from visa europe revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements 



 the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume processed transactions and crossborder volume operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services these benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the us during fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the doddfrank act we expect low doubledigit percentage growth in our operating revenues for the full 2013 fiscal year 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars there was no significant impact on the yearoveryear growth for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  as the effect of exchange rate movements was substantially mitigated through our 

hedging program we expect the impacts of our hedging program to continue to minimize the effect of exchange rate movements during fiscal 2013  see note 13—derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues 

 data processing revenues for fiscal 2012  also benefited from overall growth in processed transactions of 5  which reflected an anticipated decline in us debit transactions processed as a result of certain provisions of the doddfrank act becoming effective the third quarter of fiscal 2012 the deceleration in processed transaction growth was led by interlink one of our lowest yielding products in the us which decreased 51 in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the same prior year period this negative impact was more than offset by solid growth in cybersource billable transactions visa transactions processed outside of the us us credit transactions and visa debit transactions which exclude interlink 

data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011  primarily due to 12  growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to cybersource this growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts and a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of nonvisa network transactions on a net basis instead of a gross basis 

 40 

 increases in client incentives during fiscal 2011  reflected growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant longterm client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011  

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented 



 the decrease in fiscal 2011  reflects the change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of nonvisa network transactions on a net basis instead of on a gross basis this decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of cybersource and playspan activities 

 the decrease in fiscal 2011  primarily reflects a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the visa extras rewards program on a net basis instead of on a gross basis combined with the 

impact of a large issuer converting away from the platform entirely in june 2010 the decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 winter olympics and the 2010 fifa world cup incurred in the prior year the decline was partially offset by the inclusion of cybersource activity 

 the increase in fiscal 2011  primarily reflects the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of cybersource and playspan in july 2010 and march 2011 respectively offset by the absence of depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our october 2007 reorganization as these assets were fully depreciated as of september 30 2010 see note 5—acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements 

 the increase in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of cybersource activity combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011 

 other income expense 

the following table sets forth the components of our other income expense for the periods presented 



 42 

recognized in fiscal 2010 related to our investment in the reserve primary fund 

 effective income tax rate 

the effective income tax rate of 3 in fiscal 2012 is lower than the effective income tax rate of 36 for fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the impact of the following in fiscal 2012 

 we expect our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate to increase to a more normalized range of 30 to 32 

adjusted effective income tax rate  our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years as they are either nonrecurring have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan as such we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense additional covered litigation provision recorded and a onetime noncash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the california state apportionment rules 

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to 

 43 

 based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 

  

operating activities total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012  compared to prior year primarily reflecting higher operating revenue in fiscal 2012  we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  primarily reflecting continued growth in our net income and the absence of a 682 million prepayment of our retailers litigation obligation in fiscal 2010 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011 was relatively consistent reflecting our continued investment in availableforsale securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements comparatively cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 primarily included 18 billion  for the acquisition of cybersource 

financing activities cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the asconverted class a share count either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow and increased dividends see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 15—stockholders equity  to our consolidated financial statements 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investment securities or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and return that these holdings provide 

funds held by our foreign subsidiaries include cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities both short and longterm if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds up to the amount of 26 billion  which we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the us our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

availableforsale investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the majority of these investments 33 billion  are classified as noncurrent as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date however these investments are generally available to meet shortterm liquidity needs 

factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities uncertainty related to regulatory developments actions by central banks and other monetary authorities 

and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment see item 1a—risk factors 

revolving credit facilities in february 2008 we entered into a 30 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class b and class c common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients loans under the fiveyear facility may be in the form of 1 base rate advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus 05 and the bank of america prime rate 2 eurocurrency advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to libor as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 011 to 030 based on our credit rating or 3 us swing loan euro swing loan or foreign currency swing loan which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable swing loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for euro and sterling loans an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment we also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount whether used or unused at a rate ranging from 004 to 010 and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 005 to 010 based on our credit rating currently the applicable margin is 015 the facility fee is 005 and the utilization fee is 005 this facility contains certain covenants including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to ebitda and events of default customary for financings of this type this facility expires on february 15 2013 we are in the process of replacing this facility in fiscal 2013 there were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2012  

us commercial paper program  we maintain a 500 million us commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings the commercial paper program is a source of shortterm borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover shortterm cash needs we had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2012  there are no financial covenants related to this program 

universal shelf registration statement in july 2012 we filed a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions the registration statement expires in july 2015 

litigation escrow account pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation will be payable when the company funds the litigation escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 21—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2012  was 44 billion  and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2012  our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 



various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents a substantial daily liquidity requirement us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with industry practice for such transactions during fiscal 2012 we often did not need to fund settlement working capital as indicated by the fact that our average daily net settlement position was a payable of 43 million although our greatest working capital requirement was a peak net settlement receivable balance of 587 million 

covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation as noted above monetary liabilities from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account during fiscal 2012  we made 140 million  in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account at september 30 2012  the litigation escrow account had an available balance of 44 billion  in october 2012 we made an additional payment of 350 million from the litigation escrow account to the individual plaintiffs settlement fund see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan   and note 21—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than the covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs 

reduction in asconverted shares  during fiscal 2012  total asconverted class a common stock was reduced by 228 million  shares using 24 billion  of operating cash on hand of the 24 billion  710 million  was used to repurchase class a common stock in the open market in addition we made deposits totaling 17 billion   of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan these deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the companys class a common stock because they reduce the class b conversion rate and consequently the asconverted class a common stock share count 

in july 2012 our board of directors authorized a 1 billion  share repurchase program to be in effect through july 2013  at september 30 2012  this share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 865 million  in october 2012  our board of directors authorized an additional 15 billion  share repurchase program to be in effect through october 2013  all share repurchase programs authorized prior to july 2012 have been completed see note 15—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements 

dividends  during fiscal 2012  we paid 595 million  in dividends on october 24 2012  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 033  per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 221 million  in connection with this dividend in december 2012 see note 15—stockholders equity   to our consolidated financial statements we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by our board of directors class b and class c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

visa europe put option we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies visa incs forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 

at september 30 2012  we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately 145 million  while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2012  it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollars or more we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things visa europes adjusted sustainable income and our pe ratio in each 

case as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 

given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purposes only a range of pe ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates 100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the 100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september 30 2012  or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise its option we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a forprofit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and as a result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated pe ratios for each 25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed 100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september 30 2012  our estimated longterm pe ratio was 169 x and the longterm pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe was 19 x at september 30 2012  the spot pe ratio was 188 x and the spot pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe was 18 x these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future 



 pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service age and eligible compensation we also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act or erisa our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 88 million  74 million  and 66 million  respectively in fiscal 2013  we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately 52 million  the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences 

capital expenditures  our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2012  due to investment in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect capital expenditures to be in the 425 million  to 475 million  range in fiscal 2013  as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 

acquisitions there were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  when we acquired playspan and fundamo for a total of 268 million net of 22 million in cash received see note 5—acquisitions   to our consolidated financial statements we will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair 

value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2012  our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 98 billion  of assets and 168 million  of liabilities of these instruments 164 million  or less than 2 had significant unobservable inputs with the visa europe put option liability constituting 145 million  of this amount at september 30 2012  debt instruments in this category included 7 million  of auction rate securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments  to our consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

indemnifications 

we indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by failure of any other customer to honor visa cards travelers cheques or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see   note 1—summary of significant accounting policies   and   note 12—settlement guarantee management  to our consolidated financial statements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september 30 2012 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities or the litigation escrow account

represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements which we estimate we will record 

 critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition — client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues however if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met 

the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses such as early termination clauses managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations actual client performance amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume which drive our net revenue as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2012  client incentives represented 17  of gross operating revenues 

fair value — visa europe put option 

critical estimates we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies our forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europes projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 

upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europes adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note 2—visa europe  to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 

the fair value of visa europes option was estimated to be approximately 145 million  at september 30 2012  while the put option is in fact nontransferable this amount recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a thirdparty market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the terms of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a thirdparty market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option 

while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2012  it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollars or more see the liquidity and capital resources section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 

assumptions and judgment the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to as the pe differential 

probability of exercise— exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under its articles of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to 

i visa europes stated intentions ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results iii evaluation of market conditions including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europes largest members which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

pe differential— the pe differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward pricetoearnings multiples applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purposes the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors quantitatively we estimate our pe ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months the “longterm pe calculation” and the last 30 trading dates the “30day pe calculation” prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers estimate system ibes we then determine the best estimate of our longterm pricetoearnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30day pe calculation as compared to the longterm pe calculation in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences if any are the result of a fundamental change in our longterm value or the result of shortterm market volatility or other noncompany specific market factors that may not be indicative of our longterm forward pe we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that a market participant would more heavily weight longterm value indicators as opposed to shortterm indicators 

factors that might indicate a fundamental change in longterm value include but are not limited to changes in the regulatory environment client portfolio longterm growth rates or new product innovation a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies 

other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europes adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europes current business model as an association owned by its member banks while the highest reflect a successful shift to a forprofit model in anticipation of exercise the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that should it choose to exercise its option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a forprofit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europes results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2012  we have assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated longterm pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19 x the use of a probability of exercise that is 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 18 million  in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million  in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe as such the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2012  classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability 

and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation the plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we recorded an additional accrual of 41 billion  for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012 see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan  and note 21—legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 21—legal matters   to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the us dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the us dollar value of payments in foreign currencies primarily for expenses at our nonus locations we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated nonus dollar denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program were 739 million  and 651 million  at september 30 2012  and 2011  respectively the aggregate notional amount of 739 million  outstanding at september 30 2012  is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10  change of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately 40 million  on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2012  see note 13—derivative financial instruments   to our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency 

positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixedrate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixedrate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a fallingrate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity our operating results or cash flows have not been and are not expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2012  and 2011  were 30 billion  and 12 billion  respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately 42 million on our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2012  the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 923 million  and 764 million  at september 30 2012  and 2011  respectively 

visa europe put option 

we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september 30 2012  we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2012  we have assumed a 40  probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19 x the use of a probability of exercise 5  higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 18 million  in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million  in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 

pension plan risk 

our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 973 million  and 783 million  and projected benefit obligations were 990 million  and 839 million  at september 30 2012  and 2011  respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2013  which we expect to make in september 2013

 industry overview 

the global payments industry

core processing services 

our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between visa issuers and acquirers in addition we offer a range of valueadded processing services to support our clients’ visa programs and to promote the growth and security of our payments network 

authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholder’s account the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies settlement is the process of calculating determining reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared 

the issuer and acquirer involved in a typical visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor for example the acquirer credits the merchant’s account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer in addition the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment in the case of a credit or deferred debit card or collects payment directly from the cardholder’s deposit account in the case of a debit card 

we process most visa transactions occurring in the united states we also process most visa transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries which we refer to as crossborder transactions in many countries outside the united states domestic transactions may be processed outside of our systems generally by governmentcontrolled payments networks our clients independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our clients

 payments network management 

we devote significant resources to ensure that visa is the payments network of choice for clients merchants and cardholders we seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities educating domestic and regulatory banking authorities on our capabilities increasing issuance and acceptance of visa products around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants 

brand management and promotion and corporate reputation 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand taking a targeted analytical approach tailored by geography to achieve our growth and business objectives we combine advertising sponsorships promotions public relations and increasingly social media to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand promote product usage increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention for merchants we work to ensure that the visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment as well as a way to increase sales for our issuer clients our marketing program is designed to support their card issuance activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands 

we establish global marketing relationships to promote the visa brand and to allow clients to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events for instance we have been the exclusive payment card sponsor for the olympic games since 1986 and 

  

have extended the sponsorship through 2020 we are also one of six fifa partners which provides us with worldwide exclusive access to the fifa world cup™ and more than 40 other fifa competitions through 2014 this sponsorship creates a powerful opportunity to drive business achieve maximum exposure and improve brand lift global reach and local relevance in addition we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional national and local companies sports leagues or events such as the national football league in the united states or with associations and companies to provide customized marketing platforms to clients in certain countries and regions 

our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments these programs which we develop in conjunction with merchants generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions 

in addition we work on various fronts to maintain enhance and protect our corporate reputation and brand our corporate responsibility program helps ensure we positively impact the lives of those in our global and local communities we do so by promoting financial literacy and inclusion providing humanitarian aid and community support and engaging in responsible business practices we continue to promote an understanding of visa’s role as a payments network and articulate the ways that digital currency can advance economic empowerment and business efficiencies to that end currency of progress our corporate reputation campaign launched in october 2009 communicates the tangible benefits that visa and digital currency delivers to individuals businesses governments and economies 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

we aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fastgrowing segments such as bill payment our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations delivering valueadded information services and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment for example in october 2010 we began offering a global program that enables millions of facetoface merchants to accept visa cards for transactions of approximately 25 or less without requiring a cardholder signature pin or providing a receipt unless requested by the cardholder this program can increase speed at the point of sale enhance consumer satisfaction and deliver operating efficiencies for merchants 

we also enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our products 

client standards 

rulemaking and enforcement in general our clients are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems our clients are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with and in certain cases nonequity membership interests in our subsidiaries these rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks the standards design and features of payment cards devices and programs processing merchant acquiring activities including use of agents disputes between members risk management guaranteed settlement client financial failures and allocation of losses among clients 

we establish dispute management procedures between clients relating to specific transactions for example after a transaction is presented to an issuer the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons including fraud if the issuer believes there is a defect in a 

  

transaction the issuer may return the transaction to the acquirer an action termed a “chargeback” we enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes 

credit risk management we indemnify our clients for any settlement loss suffered due to another client’s failure to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify clients even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system we have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent years 

to manage our exposure in the event our clients fail to fund their settlement obligations we established a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures we regularly evaluate clients with significant settlement exposure to assess risk in certain instances we may require a client to post collateral or provide other guarantees if a client becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss we may also apply other risk control measures such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions limiting the use of certain types of agents prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain highrisk merchants or suspending or terminating a client’s rights to participate in our payments network the exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience estimated settlement exposures at period end and a standardized grading process for clients using where available thirdparty estimates of the probability of customer failure see item 8—financial statements and supplementary datanote 12—settlement guarantee management elsewhere in this report 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products fraud is most often committed in connection with counterfeit cards or cardnotpresent transactions using stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems not associated with visanet that store cardholder or account data including systems operated by merchants financial institutions and other thirdparty data processors 

our fraud detection and prevention offerings include 

 

  

  

  

 we work with all participants in the payment system to ensure that any entity that transmits processes or stores sensitive card information takes necessary steps to secure that data and protect cardholders for example we mandate protection of pin data through use of the triple data encryption standard and work with the payments industry to manage the payment card industry data 

  

security standards pci dss there has been significant progress in growing industry adoption of pci dss with more than 97 percent of the largest us merchants validating compliance annually 

government regulation 

general  government regulation affects key aspects of our business our clients are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and consequently such regulations have the potential to affect our business indirectly in recent years our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny see item 1a—risk factors—increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues 

the reform act  as noted during the 2011 fiscal year the us federal reserve established new rules under the reform act affecting interchange reimbursement fees network exclusivity and transaction routing we expect these rules to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of us debit payments we process and decrease associated revenues see item 1 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview and item 1a — risk factors — the reform act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  we have significantly modified our debit strategy as a result see — overview  

interchange reimbursement fees we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the united states and many other geographies the new rules under the reform act set the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounts to a significant reduction from the average systemwide fees charged previously see item 1a—risk factors—the reform act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business item 1a—risk factors—increasing regulation of interchange reimbursement fees and other business practices may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business and item 8—financial statements and supplementary data — note 21—legal matters elsewhere in this report 

the united states is not the only jurisdiction to regulate interchange reimbursement fees for example the reserve bank of australia has enacted a regulation limiting the costs that can be considered in setting interchange reimbursement fees for both our credit and our debit cards 

interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated from products in our payments system we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process 

default interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume and value they promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by giving our clients an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic 

  

transactions and to maximize participation in the visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and ultimately consumers and merchants we believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers merchants our financial institution clients and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment and by creating incentives for innovation enhanced data quality and security 

merchants do not directly pay interchange reimbursement fees a merchant’s cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate the merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in openloop payments networks including those relating to interchange and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant clients and are established in competition with other acquirers other payment card systems and other forms of payment we do not establish or regulate the level of merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers 

network exclusivity and routing we have agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition issuers of some debit products choose to include only the visa network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks coreside on visa debit cards for example visa’s rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through visanet and that a member must clear international transactions through visanet 

issues relating to network exclusivity and the routing of transactions over visanet are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions in which our cards are used most notably the new rules under the reform act limit our and issuers’ ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area the rules require issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

as another example the canadian ministry of finance has implemented a voluntary code of conduct for payment card industry participants with which visa has agreed to comply among other things the code of conduct prohibits certain restrictions on merchants’ choice of payment options they will accept see item 1a—risk factors—the reform act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business and item 1a — risk factors — regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network or denying them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transactions we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

consumer financial protection bureau the reform act created a new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent the bureau’s future actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers consumers and merchants by further regulating the industry 

nosurcharge rules we have historically implemented policies that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using visa instead of other means several jurisdictions have expressed an interest in putting an end to these nosurcharge rules most recently the reserve 

  

bank of australia has enacted a regulation stopping us from prohibiting merchants from imposing surcharges on customers who use visa affecting the manner in which we conduct our business there 

data protection and information security we devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine our information security program in order to comply with us federal and state and foreign regulations safeguarding cardholder information and requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach in addition the us federal financial institution examination council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the united states to ensure our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirements and standards as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions 

antimoney laundering antiterrorism and sanctioned countries in response to us and other regulations we devote substantial resources to maintain and to continually refine a program to prevent the use of our payments system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities we also prohibit from being visa members all financial institutions that are domiciled in countries sanctioned by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control—currently cuba iran myanmar syria and sudan in addition we refrain from any financial dealings with restricted third parties such as identified moneylaundering fronts for terrorists and narcotics traffickers 

governmentimposed market participation restrictions our business’s reach remains limited by certain countries’ protection of domestic payment card providers or payment processing providers most notably our financial institution clients in china may not issue cards carrying our brands for domestic use in china limiting our opportunities in that market regulators in australia mexico colombia india singapore russia and malaysia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries 

regulation of internet transactions  many jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of adopting new regulations and taxes on internet transactions most notably we have had to implement compliance programs in response to new us regulations requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions 

in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our clients some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our clients to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes 

various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would affect our clients directly these new requirements and developments may affect our clients’ ability to extend credit by using payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our clients’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters we own a number of valuable trademarks and designs which are essential to our business including but not limited to 

  

visa interlink plus visa electron the “winged v” design the “dove” design and the “bands designblue white  gold” we also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands products programs and services through agreements with our clients we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment including paperbased forms principally cash and checks cardbased payments including credit charge debit atm prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limiteduse cards and other electronic payments including wire transfers electronic benefits transfers automatic clearing house or ach payments and electronic data interchange 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution clients and their cardholder merchants the leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are visa mastercard american express and diners club other generalpurpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the united states in certain countries our competitors have leading positions such as china unionpay in china which is the sole domestic interbank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in china due to local regulation we also compete against privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or other merchant 

in the debit card market segment visa and mastercard are the primary global brands in addition our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands including star nyce and pulse in the united states eftpos in australia and interac in canada in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by mastercard and many of the online debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands are the primary brands and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume 

we increasingly face competition from emerging players in the payment space many of which are nonfinancial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional “bankcentric” business model the emergence of these competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on ecommerce andor mobile technologies paypal is one example it competes with visa directly in some cases yet paypal also is one of visa’s largest global ecommerce merchants 

  

based on payments volume total volume number of transactions and number of cards in circulation visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world the following chart compares our network with those of our major generalpurpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2010 

 

  

 sources mastercard american express jcb and diners club data sourced from the nilson report issue 968 march 2011 includes all consumer and commercial credit debit and prepaid cards some prior year figures have been restated currency figures are in us dollars mastercard excludes maestro and cirrus figures american express includes figures for thirdparty issuers jcb figures are for april 2009 through march 2010 and include thirdparty issuers transactions are estimates diners club figures are for the 12 months ended november 30 2010 discover data sourced from the nilson report issue 963 january 2011—us data only and includes business from thirdparty issuers 

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see note 14—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

working capital requirements 

payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients generally represents our most consistent and substantial working capital requirement arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution clients with settlement currencies other than the us dollar these settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with industry practice for such transactions we maintain working capital sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily settlement during fiscal 2011 we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of 130 million with the highest daily balance being 401 million 

seasonality 

we generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 accounted for more than 30 of our fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 operating revenues 

  

employees 

at september 30 2011 we employed approximately 7500 persons worldwide we consider our relationships with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend regulatory risks 

increasing regulation of interchange reimbursement fees and other business practices may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

interchange reimbursement fees represent a transfer of value among the financial institutions participating in a payments network such as ours in connection with transactions initiated with products in our payments system interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders the fees are typically paid by acquirers the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants we refer to a system like ours in which a payment network intermediates between the issuer and the acquirer as an openloop system 

we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees in a transaction they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process consequently changes to these fees could substantially affect our revenues and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification 

we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the united states and many other geographies however in certain jurisdictions interchange rates and related practices are subject to continuing or increased government regulation the reform act has already resulted in limitations on our ability to establish default interchange rates in the debit area in the united states see —the reform act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  in addition interchange rates have become subject to continued or increased scrutiny elsewhere and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these rates these jurisdictions include australia canada brazil and south africa 

if we cannot set default interchange rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system unattractive this could materially lower overall transaction volume or slow growth of 

  

transactions in the future it could also materially increase the attractiveness of closedloop payments systemsthose with direct connections to both merchants and consumersand other forms of payment in addition issuers could begin to charge new or higher fees to consumers this could make our card programs less desirable and reduce our transaction volumes and profitability acquirers could elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer visa cardholders to alternate payment systems in addition issuers and acquirers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking incentives from us or a reduction in the fees that we charge any of the foregoing could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

regulations that prohibit us from contracting with clients or requiring them to use only our network or denying them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transactions we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

in order to ensure our cardholders have a consistent experience we promote certain practices to ensure that visabranded cards are processed over our network we have agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition certain issuers of some debit products choose to include only the visa network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks coreside on visa debit cards for example visa’s rules require that an acquirer must process authorizations for all international transactions through visanet and that a member must clear international transactions through visanet 

the reform act already limits our and issuers’ ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see— the reform act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business  these restrictions and future regulations like them in the united states and elsewhere could cause a material decrease in the number of transactions we process in order to retain that transaction volume we might have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or we might have to increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers or acquirers or directly to merchants any of these eventualities could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the reform act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

as of october 1 2011 in accordance with the reform act the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to a significant reduction from the average systemwide fees charged previously the federal reserve has also promulgated regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

we expect these regulations to adversely affect our us debit business and associated revenues they will likely create negative pressure on our pricing reduce the volume and number of us debit payments we process and diminish associated revenues 

  

these pressures will likely arise through various channels a number of our clients may seek fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit cards they issue and reduce investments they make in marketing and rewards programs some may impose new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships some may elect to issue fewer cards enabled with visaaffiliated networks we expect many merchants to use the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors 

because we may have to reexamine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations these and other clients will have the opportunity to renegotiate terms relating to fees incentives and routing in some cases we may lose placement completely on issuers’ debit cards 

the reform act created a new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and new authority with respect to consumer protection issues including those pertaining to us to some extent the bureau’s future actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers consumers and merchants by further regulating disclosures payment card practices fees routing and other matters with respect to credit debit and prepaid 

some elements of the reform act are vague or lack definition and create the potential for networks to pursue different strategies subject to their interpretation of the regulation our interpretation may result in our pursuit of strategies less effective than those of our competitors 

overall these regulations and developments arising from the reform act could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

new regulations or legal action in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products 

regulators around the world increasingly note each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another the reform act is one notable such development similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations like those affecting debit payments could eventually spread to regulate credit 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment these include matters like interchange reimbursement fees network exclusivity operating regulations and preferred routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries provide resources or protection to selected domestic payment card networks brands and processing providers these governments may take this action in order to support these providers they may also take this action to keep us from entering these countries to 

  

force us to leave or to restrict substantially our activities there for example the government of china a significant emerging market has increasingly tightened its rules requiring use of a domestic network additionally governments in some countries may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments entirely in that country this would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our clients our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and our revenues 

recently privacy data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states at the federal and state level and in other countries for example in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach these measures may materially increase our costs and our clients’ costs they may also decrease the number of our cards our clients issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands 

increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues 

regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years complying with these and other regulations may increase our costs or reduce our revenue opportunities similarly the impact of such regulations on our clients may reduce the volume of payments we process moreover such regulations could limit the types of products and services that we offer the countries in which our cards are used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business prospects for future growth financial condition and results of operations

 litigation risks 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments 

our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation which is described in note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offerings of our shares of class a common stock or deposits of cash to the escrow account in lieu of such offerings a losssharing agreement and a judgmentsharing agreement in addition our us members are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique complicated and tiered and if we cannot use one or more of them this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

the principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement fees since 2005 approximately 55 class actions and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against us mastercard andor other defendants including certain financial institutions that issue visabranded payment cards and acquire visabranded payment transactions in the us we refer to this as the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegations the plaintiffs allege that visa’s setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws the lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york 

the plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled the allocation of any monetary judgment or a settlement among the defendants is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february 7 2011 see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

  

the visa portion of a settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provisions of our retrospective responsibility plan failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate us adequately from the impact of such settlements or judgments could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows and could even cause us to become insolvent even if our retrospective responsibility plan covered our monetary liabilities settlements or judgments in the interchange litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition settlements or judgments in the interchange litigation could include restrictions on our ability to conduct business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

the retrospective responsibility plan addresses only the covered litigation the plan does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation in addition our retrospective responsibility plan covers only the potential monetary liability from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation nonmonetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business in the future this could adversely affect our revenues increase our expenses andor limit our prospects for growth therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides us with adequate funding to satisfy our monetary obligations with respect to settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation it may not insulate us from all potential adverse consequences of them 

if we are found liable in certain other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages or change our business practices or pricing structure which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

like many other large companies we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competitionantitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others examples of such claims are described more fully in note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damages accordingly we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings 

private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us this is particularly so in cases involving merchants and consumers due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit such as the united states or canadian merchant class action lawsuits monetary damages could be significant see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future legal proceedings we may have to pay substantial damages we may also have to change our business practices including by limiting interchange reimbursement fees and by revising our rules about fees charged to consumers who choose to pay with visa this could limit our payments volume and result in a material and adverse effect on our revenues results of operations cash flow financial conditions prospects for future growth and overall business and could even cause us to become insolvent 

limitations on our business that resulted from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation for example in october 2010 we reached a settlement with the us department of justice or the doj 

  

and a number of state attorneys general relating to their investigation of certain visa merchant acceptance practices in accordance with the resulting consent decree visa will allow us merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer cardholders to a particular form of payment including to a specific network brand or to any card product such as a “nonreward” visa credit card see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the settlement does not address surcharging or the setting of default interchange and does not preclude the doj from pursuing a future investigation of these or other topics 

this settlement and other limitations on our business that were the result of settlements of or judgments in litigation could limit the fees we charge and reduce our payments volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

tax examinations or disputes or changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future the tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material and adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 20—income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

our agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities 

under our framework agreement with visa europe we indemnify it for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their activities and relating to our or their payments business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents participated in the actions giving rise to such claims such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities 

business risks 

the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 

we offer incentives to clients in order to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand our card base these include upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased incentives marketing support payments and other support over the past several years we have increased the use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states 

in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives the economic pressures on our clients arising from the reform act have increased this pressure see— the us wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our 

  

revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business this pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and profitability 

pressure on client pricing also poses indirect risks presenting the potential for the same adverse effects if we continue to increase incentives to our clients we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume the amount of feebased services we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from longterm contracts with certain clients including those that are large contributors to our revenue continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on favorable terms we may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives and we may not succeed in these efforts 

our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer because of intense competition in our industry 

the global payments industry is intensely competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment these include cash checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automatic clearinghouse payments in addition our payment programs compete against the cardbased payments systems of our competitors and privatelabel cards issued by merchants the reform act has increased this competitive pressure 

some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have they may offer a wider range of programs and services than we do they may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do they may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements than we have they may also introduce more innovative programs and services than we provide 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments these include domestic networks in the united states china canada australia and other countries and regions they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other developments in many cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions 

traditional or nontraditional competitors may put us at a competitive disadvantage by leveraging services or products in areas in which we do not directly compete to win business in areas where we do compete our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services the risk to maintaining or securing our clients’ longterm commitments to our products has increased with the reform act’s restrictions on network exclusivity in the debit sector most of our larger client relationships are not exclusive these include those with our largest clients jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstances our clients may terminate these relationships sometimes on relatively short notice and in many cases subject to significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations see note 14—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

  

we expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future for example 

 

  

  

  

 our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business 

our position in the payments value chain underpins our business certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and no intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model the reform act has provided them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although they pursue the same or similar lines of business using the same or similar business and commercial models they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients materially and adversely affecting our revenues and profitability 

the banking industry has recently undergone substantial accelerated consolidation which could continue significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors this could result in the acquired bank’s visa business shifting to that competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business to us in addition one or more of our clients could merge with or acquire one of our competitors shifting its payments volume to that competitor any such transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our clients and potential clients and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining clients and potential clients this consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us in addition consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify 

  

for higher volumebased discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business in addition the current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone nearterm investments in growing their card portfolios limit credit lines or take other actions that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients 

merchants’ continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangements 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry some merchants are seeking to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation if they continue these efforts could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

we as well as our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of our payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate we and our clients may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants this could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our clients which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

failure to maintain relationships with our clients merchant acquirers merchants and thirdparty vendors and the failure of clients to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business 

we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our clients and on their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not have direct relationships with cardholders we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if any or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features as a result the success of our business has depended significantly on and will continue to depend on the continued success and competitiveness of our clients and the strength of our relationships with them 

historically we have not solicited merchants to accept our cards in the wake of the reform act’s changes to rules on network exclusivity we expect to engage in significantly more discussions with merchants and merchant acquirers we already engage in many cobranding efforts in which we contract with the merchant who directly receives incentive funding we also engage in some amount of merchant acceptance activity as these and other relationships take on a greater importance for both 

  

merchants and us our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships 

in many countries outside the united states our clients or other processors authorize clear and settle most domestic transactions using our payment cards without involving our processing systems this pattern is increasing with a rise in new systems endorsed by governments our inability to control the endtoend processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands 

in addition we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf and to the extent that thirdparty vendors fail to deliver services our business and reputation could be impaired 

the perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation which are key assets of our business 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to visabranded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our clients that change the perception of our brands from time to time our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be subject to challenge which may materially and adversely affect our business further visa europe has very broad latitude to operate the visa business in and use our brands and technology within visa europe’s region in which we have only limited control over the operation of the visa business visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the visa brands in its region and the strength of the visa global brands depends in part on the efforts of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe finally adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny 

unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients merchants and cardholders resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business 

unprecedented economic events that began in 2008 continue to affect the financial markets around the world these include decreased consumer spending increased unemployment deflation increased savings decreased consumer debt excess housing inventory lowered government spending decreased export activity continued challenges in the credit environment continued equity market volatility additional government intervention bank instability downgrades of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issues affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policies this economic turmoil has affected the economies of the united states and other mature economies in particular 

the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments were to arise these could include among other things policy missteps exhaustion of us and other national economic stimulus packages defaults on government debt in the united states europe or elsewhere significant increases in oil prices tax increases economic turmoil in china the euro zone or japan or a significant decline in the commercial real estate market most recently the economic situation in europe has been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of a default by greece and potentially other nations on their debt obligations if such a default occurs or if the measures taken to avert such a default create their own instability the impact is likely to be global and highly significant 

  

some existing clients have been placed in receivership or under government administration many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential changes in laws and regulations many of our clients merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely affected 

our financial results may be negatively affected by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present as a result our revenue growth has been and may continue to be negatively affected or we may be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 finally the stock markets have recently demonstrated extreme volatility additional declines in stock prices or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially 

any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

  

a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and in multicurrency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions 

we generate a significant amount of our revenues from crossborder transactions our clients pay us fees in connection with crossborder transactions some of those fees may differ if conversion from the merchant’s currency to the cardholder’s billing currency is required thus revenue from processing crossborder transactions for our clients fluctuates with crossborder travel and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism natural disasters the effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a decline in the need for conversion of currencies might also adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

moreover if our clients decide to increase cardholder fees associated with crossborder transactions there could be a decline in cardholder spending since our value proposition to the consumer could be reduced 

in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients’ settlement in different currencies a reduction in or other changes to multicurrency transactions could decrease the need for or otherwise affect foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues limitations or changes in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rates for multicurrency transactions as result of regulation litigation competitive pressures or other reasons may also adversely affect our revenues 

transactions outside the united states represent an increasingly important part of our strategy if we do not maintain consistency in the types of products we provide the quality of our service and the viability of our brand we will be unable to continue to grow in those areas 

finally because we are domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations we have guaranteed 

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of our indemnification obligations are unlimited 

concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients or several of our smaller clients may exceed our available financial resources as could systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses materially and adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with 

  

our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and potentially our results of operations 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we cannot process transactions efficiently the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism climate change or accident our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks leading to an interruption in service increased costs or the compromise of data security if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded although we maintain a business continuity program and an information security program to address these risks we cannot be sure that they will be effective 

additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline reducing our revenues and net income 

rapid significant technological changes are confronting the payments industry these include developments in smart cards ecommerce mcommerce and radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industrywide standards by resistance to change from clients or merchants or by third parties’ intellectual property rights our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

account data breaches involving card data stored processed or transmitted could adversely affect our reputation and revenues 

our clients merchants others and we store process and transmit cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards in addition our clients may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems storing processing or transmitting sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visabranded cards to reputational damage and to claims against us if we are sued in connection with any material data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and 

  

profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse effect on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our costs 

an increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information they use the information to conduct fraudulent transactions outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing as a result more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards a rise in fraud levels involving our cards or in misconduct by third parties processing transactions using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands this could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs 

failure to maintain interoperability between visa inc’s and visa europe’s authorization and clearing and settlement systems could damage the business and global perception of the visa brands 

before our reorganization in october 2007 visa europe and we shared authorization clearing and settlement systems visa europe completed and substantially deployed its own systems in the 2010 fiscal year as a result visa europe and we will have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction involving both of our territories regardless of where it originates visa europe’s newly independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems as they diverge over time failure to authorize or clear and settle interterritory transactions quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the visa brands 

risks related to our structure and organization 

we have little ability to control visa europe’s operations and limited recourse if it breaches its obligations to us 

visa europe has very broad rights to operate the visa business in its region under the agreement that governs our relationship if we want to change a global rule or require visa europe to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for visa europe and its members then visa europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that visa europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation 

if visa europe fails to meet its obligations our remedies under this agreement are limited we cannot terminate the agreement even upon visa europe’s material uncured breach although we have a call right to acquire visa europe we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstances 

these and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of tax treatment of entry into the licenses and payments received thereunder 

in some instances as in the case of cybersource and playspan visa europe may have the right to control the activities of newly acquired entities within visa europe’s territory in any event visa 

  

europe’s exclusive license rights in europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entities or to operate them effectively 

any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we can provide could negatively affect cardholders from visa europe using cards in the countries we serve or our cardholders using cards in visa europe’s region 

if visa europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock we will incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income 

we have granted visa europe a put option requiring us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from its members if exercised we will incur a financial obligation of several billion dollars or more if visa europe exercises this option visa europe may do so at any time we may need to obtain thirdparty financing in order to meet our obligation by either borrowing funds or selling stock an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders we would have only 285 days to pay the exercise price sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms see note 2—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

if visa europe exercises the put option we may encounter difficulties in integrating visa europe’s business and systems into our existing operations if we cannot do so quickly and costeffectively the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we would become subject to the many regulations of the european union that govern the operations of visa europe including any regulatory disputes 

we are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option we record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations consequently the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these changes could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the costs involved in raising it 

if we cannot remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment 

since our reorganization in october 2007 we have increasingly centralized our management and operations for us to succeed we must effectively integrate our operations actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization and incorporate a global perspective into our decisions and processes if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory 

in addition the current competitive economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges we may not be able to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly enough define our appetite for risk specifically enough execute our strategy seamlessly enough implement new governance managerial and organizational processes efficiently enough and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly enough 

we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees 

our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could result in 

  

inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets adversely affecting our business our chief executive officer’s contract terminates in march 2013 and we cannot assure that there will be an effective transition to a new ceo when necessary 

acquisitions strategic investments and entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations 

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses products or technologies we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them the integration of cybersource playspan and fundamo all acquired recently will take time and resources that would otherwise have been available for other acquisitions we will be subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in the visa europe territory regulatory constraints particularly competition regulations may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments 

furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues moreover our cash reserves contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions and investments 

with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments we may choose to participate in areas in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisition or through organic development relative inexperience in such businesses requires additional resources and presents an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our operations and results 

future sales of our class a common stock or the expiration or waiver of transfer restrictions on our class b stock could result in dilution to holders of shares of our existing class a common stock adversely affecting their rights and depressing the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price and voting power of our class a common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding the market price of our class a common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur such as upon the issuance or conversion of securities convertible to shares of our class a common stock specifically upon the final resolution of our covered litigation all class b stock will become transferable at once 

if funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class a common stock will be diluted 

under our retrospective responsibility plan funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us at that time each share of class b common stock will become convertible into an increased number of shares of class a common stock benefitting the holders of class b common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest in visa inc held by the holders of class a common stock in this case the amount of funds released and the market price of our class a common stock will determine the extent of the dilution 

  

holders of our shares of our class b and c common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class a common stock 

although their voting rights are limited holders of shares of our class b and c common stock can vote on certain significant transactions these include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required by delaware law the holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable for instance except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance in addition except for common stock issued to a member in connection with our reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock shares held by a competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may not exceed 5 of our total outstanding shares on an asconverted basis 

our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

since august 2008 we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class a b and c common stock any future payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant if because of these factors we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may be unable to make payments of dividends of our common stock furthermore no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class of common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of visa inc and its subsidiaries “visa” “we” “our” and the “company” on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings as well as those factors that may affect future earnings the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses banks and governments around the world enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash we provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit debit prepaid and commercial payments we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions merchants consumers businesses and government entities each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic forms of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities particularly outside the united states we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position visa to serve more and different constituencies 

overall economic conditions and regulatory environment our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending our business performance during the year ended september 30 2011 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery 

the reform act as of october 1 2011 in accordance with the reform act the federal reserve capped the maximum us debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twentyone cents plus five basis points before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to a significant reduction from the average systemwide fees charged previously the federal reserve has also promulgated regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card the rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions 

we expect the interchange and exclusivity regulations as well as the routing regulations to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of us debit payments we process and decrease associated revenues a number of our clients may seek fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit cards they issue and reduce investments they make in marketing and rewards programs some may impose new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships some may elect to issue fewer cards enabled with visaaffiliated networks we expect many merchants to use the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors we expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year and the pace of our us revenue growth to begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013 

because we may have to reexamine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations these and other clients will have the opportunity to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees incentives and routing in some cases we may lose placement completely on issuers’ debit cards 

we believe that we will be able to mitigate the negative impacts from the reform act to some extent through pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win 

  

merchant preference to route transactions over our network our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers we believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency may help buffer the impacts of the reform act as reflected in our overall payments volume growth particularly outside the united states as a leader in the us debit industry we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the reform act while mitigating some of the negative impacts the reform act would have on our current business models we remain committed and prepared to adapt to and to compete effectively under this new us debit regulatory environment 

share repurchases we effectively repurchased 430 million shares at an average price of 7494 per share for a total cost of 32 billion during the year ended september 30 2011 of the 32 billion 20 billion was executed through the repurchase of class a common stock in the open market and 12 billion was effectively executed through deposits into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan 

adjusted financial results  during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded a decrease of 122 million and 79 million respectively in the fair value of the visa europe put option which resulted in the recognition of noncash nonoperating other income in our financial results these amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision the following table presents our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2011 and 2010 excluding the impact of this revaluation 

 

 we believe the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the period the reduction in the fair value of the put option in each fiscal year was primarily the result of declines in our estimated longterm pricetoearnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that visa europe will exercise its option we therefore believe that the resulting nonoperating income recorded is not indicative of visa’s performance in these years or future periods 

fundamo acquisition  on june 9 2011 we acquired fundamo a leading platform provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies for 110 million the acquisition was made to accelerate the execution of visa’s global strategy to provide the next generation of payments solutions and to provide longterm growth opportunities to connect unbanked or underbanked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure reliable and globally accepted form of payment the fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of 002 for the full 2011 fiscal year see note 5—acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 

playspan acquisition on march 1 2011 we acquired playspan a privately held company whose payments platform processes transactions for digital goods in online games digital media and social 

  

networks around the world for total potential purchase consideration of up to 225 million the acquisition of playspan extends visa’s capabilities in digital ecommerce and mcommerce in order to expand the scope of payment services available to clients and consumers see note 5—acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements the playspan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of 003 for the full 2011 fiscal year 

sale of investment in companhia brasileira de soluções e serviços “cbss” on january 24 2011 our whollyowned subsidiary visa international sold its 10 percent stake in visa vale issuer cbss to banco do brasil and banco bradesco cbss continues to issue visa vale prepaid cards in brazil and visa expects no disruption to cardholder service as a result of this transaction visa’s gross proceeds from the sale were 103 million after receiving regulatory approval during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we recognized a pretax gain net of transaction costs of 85 million in the investment income net line on our consolidated statements of operations the amount of the gain net of tax was 44 million see note 6—prepaid expenses and other assets to our consolidated financial statements 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues we have maintained double digit growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions for the past two years the increase in payments volume and processed transactions reflects the continuing worldwide shift to digital currency 

the following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars 1  

 

  

  

   

   the table below provides the number of transactions processed by our visanet system and billable transactions processed by cybersource’s network during the fiscal periods presented 

 

  

    results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visabranded cards for goods and services as well as the number size and type of transactions processed on our visanet system we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest and fees paid by cardholders on visabranded cards our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders and most other competitive card features we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants establish and earn these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues are primarily earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the visa brand service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and visa europe data processing revenues include revenues earned for transactions processed by visanet our secure centralized global processing platform cybersource’s online payment gateway and playspan’s virtual goods payment platform 

  

international transaction revenues are generally driven by crossborder payments and cash volume and currency conversion activities crossborder volumes involve transactions where the cardholder’s issuer country is different from the merchant’s country and includes both single and multicurrency transactions 

other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement fees from cardholder services licensing and certification and activities related to our recently acquired entities other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services 

client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel includes salaries incentive compensation stockbased compensation fringe benefits and contractor expense 

network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the visa brand 

professional fees consist of fees for consulting legal and other professional services 

depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of acquired in technology and other assets including finitelived intangible assets obtained in our july 2010 acquisition of cybersource march 2011 acquisition of playspan and june 2011 acquisition of fundamo 

general and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business 

litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile the specifics of the case advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates 

other income expense 

interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 

investment income net represents returns on our fixedincome securities and other investments investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other cost method investments 

  

other nonoperating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the visa europe put option 

visa inc fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the united states in the rest of the world and from visa europe revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services see note 2—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

 the increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued double digit growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume processed transactions and crossborder payments volume operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services as well as the inclusion of activity from newly acquired entities the benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to client incentives as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the reform act the new us debit regulations will likely moderate the pace of our operating revenue growth in the us primarily within service and data processing revenues through fiscal 2012 we expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year we further expect that the pace of our us revenue growth will begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to us dollars the general weakening of the us dollar during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities resulting in a net 2 and 1 increase respectively in total operating revenues compared to the same prior year periods in comparison the general strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal 2009 net against the impact from our hedging activities resulted in a 3 decline in total operating revenues we do not expect a significant impact from currency fluctuations during the 2012 fiscal year as the effect of exchange rate movements is minimized through our hedging program 

  

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues 

 

  

  

 service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13 growth in nominal payments volume the growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening us dollar 

 

 data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009 combined with growth of 14 in the number of transactions processed fiscal 2010 data processing revenues also benefited slightly from the inclusion of cybersource activity since the july acquisition 

 

 international transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16 in nominal crossborder payments volume combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

   

 other revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to license fees from cielo formerly known as companhia brasileira de meios de pagamento or visanet do brasil for the use of visa trademarks and technology intellectual property the increase also reflected growth in other license and royalty fees 

 

 client incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant longterm customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010 these increases were offset by lower onetime incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009 

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented 

 

  

  

   

 the decrease in fiscal 2010 reflects lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our us pension plan see note 11—pension postretirement and other benefits to our consolidated financial statements  the decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of cybersource in july 2010 

 

 the increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through nonvisa networks 

 

 the increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher spending in connection with the 2010 winter olympics and the 2010 fifa world cup the increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the visa extras loyalty platform 

 

 the increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects professional fees associated with our acquisition of cybersource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider the increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009 

 

   

 the increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the cybersource acquisition as well as charges related to the east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009 

 

 in fiscal 2010 general and administration expenses increased primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 winter olympics and the 2010 fifa world cup 

 

 other income expense 

the following table sets forth the components of our other income expense for the periods presented 

 

  

  

  

 investment income net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pretax gain of 473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in visanet do brasil in fiscal 2009 additionally we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates applicable to our investments and lower investment balances 

  

 effective income tax rate 

the effective tax rates were 36 in fiscal 2011 and 2010 compared with 41 in fiscal 2009 

the effective tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the benefit of tax incentives in singapore our largest operating hub outside the us beneficial changes in the geographic mix of our global income the nontaxable revaluations of the visa europe put option in fiscal 2011 and 2010 and the absence of additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in visanet do brasil in fiscal 2009 

as a result of anticipated beneficial changes to certain state tax laws beginning in fiscal 2012 and other factors we expect our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal 2012 to 33 to 34 this rate excludes any potential related noncash impact from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios to ensure payments on required litigation settlements to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities to make planned capital investments in our business to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are highquality and marketable in the short term 

based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented 

 

   

operating activities total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher yeartodate net income and the absence of a 682 million prepayment of our retailer’s litigation obligation in the prior year both periods also contain other significant operational payments including those related to client incentives settlement transactions other litigation settlement payments and our annual incentive compensation payments which were broadly consistent year over year although we expect the new us debit regulations to moderate the pace of our growth in operating cash in fiscal 2012 we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income including noncontrolling interest of 30 billion and adjustments for noncash items of 21 billion offset by payments for client incentives and litigation settlements primarily including 682 million prepayment of our retailers’ litigation obligation total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher net income and lower litigation settlement payments 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income including noncontrolling interest of 24 billion and adjustments for noncash items of 15 billion standard noncash adjustments for client incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a 473 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in visanet do brasil which is reflected in investing activities cash from operating activities also reflects the use of 33 billion to fund significant operational payments including litigation and client incentives 

investing activities cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects purchases of 19 billion in us governmentsponsored debt securities and us treasury securities the acquisition of playspan and fundamo for 268 million net of 22 million in cash received  and purchases of property equipment and technology which were higher compared to the prior year due to ongoing investments in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives the use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by the gross proceeds of 103 million from the sale of our investment in visa vale issuer cbss see note 4—fair value measurements and investments and note 6—prepaid expenses and other assets to our consolidated financial statements  

cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of cybersource in july 2010 for 18 billion net of 147 million in cash received the use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of 56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities which were reinvested in money market funds we also received 89 million in cash distributions from the reserve primary fund or the fund 

cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the 884 million of cash distribution from the fund net cash proceeds of 290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and 10 billion from the sale of our 10 ownership in visanet do brasil all of which were reinvested in money market funds we also purchased 306 million of property equipment and technology primarily related to the construction of our east coast data center 

financing activities cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects 20 billion in repurchases of our class a common stock in the open market deposits of 12 billion into the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of 423 million the company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in september 2011 see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements  

cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects 10 billion in repurchases of class a common stock in the open market a deposit of 500 million to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of 368 million 

  

cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractuallyrequired redemption of certain series of our class c common shares for 26 billion deposits of 18 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of 318 million offset by covered litigation payments totaling 20 billion from the litigation escrow account 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investment securities or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and return that these holdings provide 

as of september 30 2011 21 billion of cash cash equivalent and availableforsale investments securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds up to the amount of undistributed earnings of 19 billion however our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

investment portfolio our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities including money market funds and debt securities issued by the us treasury or us governmentsponsored agencies the liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 

other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting certain securities rates of default of the underlying assets underlying collateral value discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment see item 1a—risk factors—unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients merchants and cardholders resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business 

revolving credit facilities on february 15 2008 we entered into a 30 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class b and class c common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients loans under the fiveyear facility may be in the form of 1 base rate advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus 05 and the bank of america prime rate 2 eurocurrency advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to libor as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 011 to 030 based on our credit rating or 3 us swing loan euro swing loan or foreign currency swing loan which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable swing loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for euro and sterling loans an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment we also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount whether used or unused at a rate ranging from 004 to 010 and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 005 to 010 based on our credit rating currently the applicable margin is 015 the facility fee is 005 and the utilization fee is 005 this facility contains certain covenants including financial 

  

covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to ebitda and events of default customary for financings of this type this facility expires on february 15 2013 there were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2011 

us commercial paper program  we maintain a 500 million us commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings the commercial paper program is a source of shortterm borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover shortterm cash needs we had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2011 there are no financial covenants related to this program 

universal shelf registration statement on may 6 2009 we filed a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions the registration statement expires on may 5 2012 

escrow account we maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters when the company funds the escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan and note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2011 was 29 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2011 our credit ratings by standard and poor’s and moody’s were as follows 

 

 various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with industry practice for such transactions 

covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation as noted above settlements 

  

of or judgments in covered litigation are paid from the escrow account see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan and note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements  as well as sources of liquidity  during fiscal 2011 we made 280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs 

share repurchase during fiscal 2011 we used 32 billion to effectively repurchase 430 million class a common shares on an asconverted basis including 20 billion in open market repurchases and 12 billion in deposits into the litigation escrow account repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares we have completed the share repurchase programs previously authorized by the board of directors in april 2011 and october 2010 in july 2011 our board of directors authorized a new 10 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through july 20 2012 at september 30 2011 the july share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of 577 million on october 26 2011 we announced that our board of directors authorized a 10 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program subject to the same terms of the july authorization see note 15—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements 

dividends  during fiscal 2011 we paid 423 million in dividends on october 18 2011 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 022 per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 151 million in connection with this dividend in december 2011 see note 15—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by our board of directors class b and class c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

visa europe put option we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies visa inc’s forward pricetoearnings multiple or the “pe ratio” as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the “adjusted sustainable income” as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 

at september 30 2011 we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately 145 million while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2011 it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollars or more we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our pe ratio in each case as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 

given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably 

  

estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purposes only a range of pe ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates 100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the 100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september 30 2011 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise its option we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a forprofit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and as a result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated pe ratios for each 25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed 100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september 30 2011 our estimated longterm pe ratio was 169x and the longterm pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe was 19x at september 30 2011 the spot pe ratio was 149x and the spot pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe was 11x these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future 

 

  

 pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service age and eligible compensation employees hired before january 1 2008 earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment employees hired or rehired on or after january 1 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula effective january 1 2011 all employees accrued benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased to accrue benefits under any other formula we also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act or erisa our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 74 million 66 million and 170 million respectively in fiscal 2012 we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately 54 million the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2011 due to investment in technology infrastructure and growth initiatives we expect capital expenditures to be in the 350 million to 400 million range in fiscal 2012 as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure 

  

acquisitions we acquired playspan and fundamo for a total of 268 million net of 22 million in cash received on march 1 2011 and june 9 2011 respectively the acquisitions extend our capabilities in digital ecommerce and mcommerce and provide longterm growth opportunities to connect billions of unbanked or underbanked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure reliable and globally accepted form of payment see note 5—acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements we will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future 

other uses the company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in september 2011 see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements  

fair value measurementsfinancial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2011 our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 64 billion of assets and 176 million of liabilities of these securities 176 million or less than 3 had significant unobservable inputs with the visa europe put option liability constituting 145 million of this amount at september 30 2011 debt instruments in this category included 7 million of auction rate securities see note 4—fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements 

there was no outstanding debt at september 30 2011 see note 10—debt to our consolidated financial statements  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

guarantees and indemnifications 

we indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor visa cards traveler’s cheques or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements 

in 2001 visa international entered into a 20year lease agreement for premises in london to be occupied by visa europe the lease is assigned to visa europe services inc or vesi a whollyowned subsidiary of visa europe with visa international acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the united kingdom in the event of a default by vesi visa international is obligated to make base lease payments vesi has agreed to reimburse visa international for any liabilities that may arise under visa international’s guarantee to the landlord visa international has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than 1 million at september 30 2011 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at september 30 2011 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities see note 2—visa europe note 11—pension postretirement and other benefits note 18—commitments and contingencies  and note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements  

 

  

       

   critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition—client incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit can be established we generally capitalize certain incentive payments under these agreements if certain criteria are met the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses such as early termination clauses management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred incentives are accrued systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the period of future economic benefit 

  

assumptions and judgment estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if our clients’ actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume which drive our net revenue as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2011 client incentives represented 17 of gross operating revenues 

fair value—visa europe put option 

critical estimates we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies our forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe’s projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 

upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note 2—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 

the fair value of visa europe’s option was estimated to be approximately 145 million at september 30 2011 while the put option is in fact nontransferable this amount recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a thirdparty market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the terms of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a thirdparty market participant might pay in an arm’s length transaction under normal business conditions a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option 

while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2011 it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollars or more see the liquidity and capital resources section of management’s discussion and analysis for further discussion 

assumptions and judgment the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to as the pe differential 

  

probability of exercise exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under its articles of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to i visa europe’s stated intentions ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results iii evaluation of market conditions including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europe’s largest members which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

pe differential the pe differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward pricetoearnings multiples applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purposes the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors quantitatively we estimate our pe ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months the “longterm pe calculation” and the last 30 trading dates the “30day pe calculation” prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers’ estimate system ibes we then determine the best estimate of our longterm pricetoearnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30day pe calculation as compared to the longterm pe calculation in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences if any are the result of a fundamental change in our longterm value or the result of shortterm market volatility or other noncompany specific market factors that may not be indicative of our longterm forward pe we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that a market participant would more heavily weight longterm value indicators as opposed to shortterm indicators 

factors that might indicate a fundamental change in longterm value include but are not limited to changes in the regulatory environment client portfolio longterm growth rates or new product innovation a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market’s expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies 

other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europe’s current business model as an association owned by its member banks while the highest reflect a successful shift to a forprofit model in anticipation of exercise the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that should it choose to exercise its option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a forprofit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe’s results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2011 we have assumed a 40 probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated longterm pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19x the use of a probability of exercise that is 5 higher than our estimate would have 

  

resulted in an increase of approximately 18 million in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe as such the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2011 classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management’s expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months 

fair valuegoodwill and intangible assets 

critical estimates we are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including intangible assets in a business combination the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill we are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment 

assumptions and judgment judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations including goodwill and intangible assets can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate the weightedaverage cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management we believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management’s judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors including the competitive environment market share customer history and macroeconomic situation we determined that our visa brand customer relationships and visa europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives based on our significant market share history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and historical retention rates as a result of acquiring fundamo in june 2011 playspan in march 2011 and cybersource in july 2010 respectively we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships tradenames and reseller relationships which we determined have finite useful lives ranging primarily from 1 to 15 years see note 5—acquisitions and note 8—intangible assets net to our consolidated financial statements our assets acquired liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level 

indefinitelived intangible assets  annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist we test each category of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis which may require the allocation of cash flows andor an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows business plans and use of present value techniques as of february 1 2011 our annual impairment review date we evaluated our indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date no recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization 

finitelived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group an impairment loss is recognized the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value no recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that finitelived intangible assets were impaired as of september 30 2011 

goodwill review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist goodwill impairment is reviewed using a twostep 

  

process the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment exists and the second step is not performed if the fair value is less than the carrying value the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition we rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows business plans and use of present value techniques we evaluated our goodwill for impairment on february 1 2011 our annual impairment review date and concluded there was no impairment as of that date subsequent to this annual assessment we acquired fundamo and playspan which resulted in additional goodwill no recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization as of september 30 2011 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates we may be exposed to impairment charges the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets net were 117 billion and 114 billion respectively including 109 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets and 553 million of finitelived intangible assets net at september 30 2011 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation the plan’s mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance we did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2011 see note 3—retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the 

  

allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the american express litigation and the discover litigation and other matters see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis we do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies primarily for expenses at our nonus locations we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated nonus dollar denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

we utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the following 12 months the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was 651 million and 627 million at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively the aggregate notional amount of 651 million outstanding at september 30 2011 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10 change of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately 54 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2011 see note 13—derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

  

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity our operating results or cash flows have not been and are not expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities at september 30 2011 and 2010 were 12 billion and 135 million respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at september 30 2011 the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 764 million and 13 million at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

equity price risk 

visa europe put option w e have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair market value at september 30 2011 we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2011 we have assumed a 40 probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 19x the use of a probability of exercise 5 higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 18 million in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 84 million in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 

pension plan our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 783 million and 766 million and projected benefit obligations were 839 million and 743 million at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2012 which we expect to make in september 2012

 to ensure our longterm success and the success of our clients 

 

  

 we operate an openloop payments network a multiparty system in which visa connects financial institutions—issuing financial institutions or “issuers” that issue cards to cardholders and acquiring financial institutions or “acquirers” that have the banking relationship with merchants – and manage the exchange of information and value between them as such visa does not issue cards extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers in most instances cardholder and merchant relationships belong to and are managed by our network of financial institution clients we derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume transactions that we process and other related services that we provide 

business developments in fiscal 2010 included the following 

 

  

   

  

  

 industry overview 

the global payments industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which is undergoing a powerful secular shift towards cardbased and other electronic payments and away from paperbased payments such as cash and checks for more than 50 years visa has played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers businesses governments and merchants we believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience security enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms we also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency control and security and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience 

the global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer including 

 

  

  

  

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are generalpurpose cards which offer widespread merchant acceptance general purpose cards are typically categorized as 

 

  

   

 primary global general purpose card brands include visa mastercard american express jcb and discoverdiners club while these brands—including visa—were historically associated with consumer credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets visa and others have over time broadened their offerings to include debit atm prepaid and commercial cards 

our core operations 

we derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our clients based on payments volume transactions that we process and other related services we provide our clients deliver visa products and payment services to consumers and merchants based on product platforms we define and manage payments network management is a core part of our operations as it ensures that our payments system provides a safe efficient consistent and interoperable service to cardholders merchants and financial institutions worldwide 

transaction processing services 

processing infrastructure 

we own and operate visanet which consists of multiple synchronized processing centers including a new east coast data center in the united states in addition visa europe operates one processing center in the united kingdom which is part of our synchronized system in accordance with the terms of our framework agreement with visa europe these centers are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and valueadded services 

visanet is built on a centralized architecture enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and to provide valueadded information such as risk scoring or loyalty applications while the transaction data is being routed through our system 

cybersource a whollyowned subsidiary of visa inc operates multiple data centers in the united states and internationally these secure data center facilities allow for high availability transaction services and connectivity to the internet clients and processing partners 

core processing services 

our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between visa issuers and acquirers in addition we offer a range of valueadded processing services to support our clients’ visa programs and to promote the growth and security of the visa payments network 

authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholder’s account the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies settlement is the process of calculating determining reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared 

the issuer and acquirer involved in a typical visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor for example the acquirer credits the merchant’s account for the 

  

amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer in addition the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment in the case of a credit or deferred debit card or collects payment directly from the cardholder’s deposit account in the case of a debit card 

we process most visa transactions occurring in the united states we also process most visa transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries referred to as crossborder transactions in many countries outside the united states domestic transactions may be processed outside of our systems generally by governmentcontrolled payments networks our clients independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our clients 

we perform clearing and settlement through visanet for transactions involving an issuer that is located in visa europe’s region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world or vice versa in addition we provided clearing and settlement services for visa transactions occurring entirely within visa europe’s region before visa europe substantially deployed its own processing system in fiscal 2010 the impact to our consolidated financial results as a result of this deployment was not material visa europe authorizes transactions for its members through its own processing system

in addition to the ecommerce cybersource development mentioned above we announced the following innovative offerings 

 

  

  

 payments network management 

we devote significant resources to ensure that visa is the payments network of choice for clients merchants and cardholders we seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities increasing acceptance of visa cards around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants 

brand management and promotion and corporate reputation 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand taking a targeted analytical approach tailored by geography to achieve our growth and business objectives we combine advertising sponsorships promotions public relations and increasingly social media to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand promote product 

  

usage increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention for merchants we work to ensure that the visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment as well as a way to increase sales for our clients our marketing program is designed to support their card issuance activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands 

we establish global marketing relationships to promote the visa brand and to allow clients to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events for instance we have been the exclusive payment card sponsor for the olympic games since 1986 and recently extended the sponsorship through 2020 we are also one of six fifa partners which provides us with worldwide exclusive access to the fifa world cup™ and more than 40 other fifa competitions through 2014 this sponsorship creates a powerful opportunity to drive business achieve maximum exposure and improve brand lift global reach and local relevance in addition we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional national and local companies sports leagues or events such as the national football league in the united states or with associations and companies to provide customized marketing platforms to clients in certain countries and regions 

our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments these programs which we develop in conjunction with merchants generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions 

in addition we work on various fronts to maintain enhance and protect our corporate reputation and brand our corporate responsibility program helps ensure we positively impact the lives of those in our global and local communities we do so by focusing on promoting financial literacy and inclusion providing humanitarian aid and community support and engaging in responsible business practices we continue to stress the importance of promoting an understanding of visa’s role as a payments network and articulating the ways that digital currency can advance economic empowerment and business efficiencies to that end currency of progress our corporate reputation campaign launched in october 2009 communicates the tangible benefits that visa and digital currency delivers to individuals businesses governments and economies 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

we aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fastgrowing segments such as bill payment our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations delivering valueadded information services such as the visa incentive network and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment for example in october 2010 we began offering a global program that enables millions of facetoface merchants to accept visa cards for transactions of approximately us25 or less without requiring a cardholder signature pin or providing a receipt unless requested by the cardholder this program has the potential to increase speed at the pointofsale enhance consumer satisfaction and deliver operating efficiencies for merchants 

we also enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our cards 

client standards 

rulemaking and enforcement in general our clients are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems our clients are obligated to honor our rules and 

  

standards through agreements with and in certain cases nonequity membership interests in our subsidiaries these rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks the standards design and features of payment cards devices and programs merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants use of agents disputes between members risk management guaranteed settlement client financial failures and allocation of losses among clients 

we establish dispute management procedures between clients relating to specific transactions for example after a transaction is presented to an issuer the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons including fraud if the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction the issuer may return the transaction to the acquirer an action termed a “chargeback” we enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes 

credit risk management we indemnify our clients for any settlement loss suffered due to another client’s failure to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify clients even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system no material loss related to settlement risk has been incurred in recent years 

to manage our exposure in the event our clients fail to fund their settlement obligations we have a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures we regularly evaluate clients with significant settlement exposure to assess risk in certain instances we may require a client to post collateral or provide other guarantees if a client becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss we may also apply other risk control measures such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions limiting the use of certain types of agents prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain highrisk merchants or suspending or terminating a client’s rights to participate in our payments network the exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model key inputs to the model include the probability of clients becoming insolvent statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience and estimated settlement exposures at period end 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products fraud is most often committed in connection with counterfeit cards or cardnotpresent transactions using stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder or account data including systems operated by merchants financial institutions and other thirdparty data processors 

our fraud detection and prevention offerings include 

 

  

  

  

   

we work with all participants in the payment system to ensure any entity that transmits processes or stores sensitive card information takes necessary steps to secure that data and protect cardholders for example visa mandates protection of pin data through use of the triple data encryption standard and works with the payments industry to manage the payment card industry data security standards pci dss there has been significant progress in growing industry adoption of pci dss with more than 95 percent of the largest us merchants validating compliance annually 

interchange reimbursement fees 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system we set default interchange rates in the united states and other regions in certain jurisdictions interchange rates are subject to government regulation although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process we do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees interchange reimbursement fees are often the largest single component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards 

we believe that default interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume and value and promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by giving our clients an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and ultimately consumers and merchants we believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers merchants our financial institution clients and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment and by creating incentives for innovation enhanced data quality and security 

interchange reimbursement fees and related practices have come to the attention of or have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of jurisdictions including for example australia canada brazil and south africa in the united states in particular the wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law on july 21 2010 and will impact interchange fees related to debit card products we are currently devoting substantial management and financial resources to explain the importance of and defend interchange reimbursement fee practices in these geographies see item 1a—risk factors—interchange reimbursement fees and related practices are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide and resulting regulations may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business and item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 22—legal matters elsewhere in this report 

merchant discount rates  merchants do not pay interchange reimbursement fees a merchant’s cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate the merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in openloop payments networks including those relating to interchange and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant clients and are established in competition with other acquirers other payment card systems and other forms of payment we do not establish or regulate merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers 

  

government regulation 

general  government regulation affects key aspects of our business we are subject to regulation of the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used our clients are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and consequently such regulations affect our business in recent years our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny 

network exclusivity and routing issues relating to network exclusivity and to interchange fees associated with openloop payments systems such as ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions in which our cards are used most notably the wall street reform and consumer protection act recently enacted in the united states includes provisions that will regulate the selection of payment networks by issuers and the routing of debit transactions by retailers this may result in the routing of debit transactions onto competitive networks potentially reducing the processing fees we earn on debit transactions 

interchange fees  the us wall street reform and consumer protection act also established regulation and oversight by the us federal reserve board of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices in addition the federal reserve now has the power to regulate network fees to the extent necessary to prevent evasion of the new rules on interchange rates although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange reimbursement fees interchange reimbursement fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume 

interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of jurisdictions most notably 

 

  

  

 data protection and information security  aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy regulation in the united states and elsewhere for example in the united states our clients and we are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s 

  

information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any cardholder information at issue our financial institution clients in the united states are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us clients is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of cardholder information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to cardholders in addition a large number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism  most jurisdictions in which our clients and we operate have implemented amended or have pending antimoney laundering and antiterrorism regulations we are subject to the provisions of the usa patriot act which requires the creation and implementation of comprehensive antimoney laundering programs in general this requires that we make certain efforts to prevent the use of our payments system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities including for example the designation of a compliance officer training of employees adoption of internal policies and procedures to mitigate money laundering risks and periodic audits 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control or ofac restricting financial dealings with cuba iran myanmar and sudan as well as financial dealings with certain restricted third parties such as identified money laundering fronts for terrorists or narcotics traffickers while we prohibit financial institutions that are domiciled in those countries or are restricted parties from being visa members many visa international members are nonus financial institutions and thus are not subject to ofac restrictions accordingly our payments network may be used with respect to transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to ofacadministered sanctions 

further certain us states have enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments 

issuer practice legislation and regulation  the board of governors of the us federal reserve system is in the process of implementing the credit card act enacted in may 2009 the credit card act will have a significant impact on the disclosures made by our clients and on our clients’ account terms and business practices the credit card act and its implementing regulations will make it more difficult for credit card issuers to price credit cards for future credit risk and will have a significant effect on the pricing credit allocation and business models of most major credit card issuers the law could reduce credit availability or increase the cost of credit to cardholders possibly affecting visa transaction volume and revenues 

the credit card act also includes provisions that impose limits and restrictions on certain prepaid or “pay before” card products including those imposed on fees the statutory provisions and implementing regulations may diminish the attractiveness of these products to our clients and may consequently adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues 

the board of governors of the us federal reserve system has also adopted regulations on overdraft fees imposed in connection with atm and debit card transactions these regulations will have the effect of significantly reducing overdraft fees our clients may charge in connection with debit card programs this may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our clients and may adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues 

  

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors to displace us from or prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies for example our financial institution clients in china may not issue cards carrying our brands for domestic use in china governments in certain other countries have considered similar restrictions from time to time 

financial industry regulation the us federal financial institution examination council periodically reviews certain of our operations in the united states to ensure our compliance with applicable data integrity and security requirements as well as other requirements applicable to us because of our role as a service provider to financial institutions in recent years the federal banking regulators in the united states have adopted a series of regulatory measures intended to require more conservative accounting greater risk management and higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders 

in the united states regulators and the us congress have increased their scrutiny of our clients’ pricing and underwriting standards relating to credit for example a number of regulations have been issued to implement the us fair and accurate credit transactions act one such regulation pertaining to riskbased pricing could have a significant impact on the application process for credit cards and result in increased costs of issuance andor a decrease in the flexibility of card issuers to set the price of credit 

the us wall street reform and consumer protection act created a new independent consumer financial protection bureau within the federal reserve system the bureau will assume responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and will have new authorities with respect to consumer issues including those pertaining to us to some extent the creation of the bureau and its actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers 

government regulators may determine that we are a systemically important payments system and impose settlement risk management requirements on us including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for client participation and merchant access to our payments system in addition outside of the united states a number of jurisdictions have implemented legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payments systems for example regulators in australia mexico colombia india singapore and malaysia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in those countries 

regulation of internet transactions  many jurisdictions in which our clients and we operate are considering or are expected to consider legislation with regard to internet transactions and in particular with regard to choice of law the legality of certain ecommerce transactions the collection of applicable taxes and copyright and trademark infringement in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including visa and our us clients and compliance was required by june 1 2010 these federal rules require us and our clients to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs decrease our transaction volumes or both 

in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our clients some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our clients to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes 

  

various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would affect our clients directly these new requirements and developments may affect our clients’ ability to extend credit by using payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our clients’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

we own a number of valuable trademarks and designs which are essential to our business including visa interlink plus visa electron the “winged v” design the “dove” design and the “bands design—blue white  gold” we also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands products programs and services through agreements with our clients we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network 

in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment including paperbased forms principally cash and checks cardbased payments including credit charge debit atm prepaid privatelabel and other types of generalpurpose and limiteduse cards and other electronic payments including wire transfers electronic benefits transfers automatic clearing house or ach payments and electronic data interchange 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution clients and their cardholder merchants the leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are visa mastercard american express and diners club other generalpurpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the united states in certain countries our competitors have leading positions such as china unionpay in china which is the sole domestic interbank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in china due to local regulation we also compete against privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or other merchant 

in the debit card market segment visa and mastercard are the primary global brands in addition our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by mastercard and many of the online debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands are the primary brands and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume 

we increasingly face competition from emerging players in the payment space many of which are nonfinancial institution networks that have departed from the more traditional “bankcentric” business model the emergence of these competitive networks has primarily been via the online channel with a focus on ecommerce andor mobile technologies 

  

based on payments volume total volume number of transactions and number of cards in circulation visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world the following chart compares our network with those of our major generalpurpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2009

for more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and other financial information see note 15—enterprisewide disclosures and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

working capital requirements 

payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients generally represents our most consistent and substantial liquidity requirement arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution clients with settlement currencies other than the us dollar these settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions we maintain working capital sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily settlement during fiscal 2010 we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of 129 million with the highest daily balance being 386 million 

seasonality 

we do not expect to experience any pronounced seasonality in our business no individual quarter of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 accounted for more than 30 of our fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 operating revenues 

  

employees

we have agreements with some issuers under which they agree to issue certain payment cards that use only the visa network or receive incentives if they do so in addition certain issuers of some debit products choose to include only the visa network we refer to these various practices as network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rules or practices may be interpreted as limiting the routing options of merchants when multiple debit networks coreside on visa debit cards increased regulatory scrutiny in the united states has already resulted in laws that will limit our and issuers’ ability to impose rules for or choose various forms of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see— the us wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business  these restrictions and future regulations like them in the united states and elsewhere have the potential to cause a material decrease in the number of transactions we process in order to retain that transaction volume we might have to reduce the fees we charge to issuers or acquirers or we might have to increase the payments and other incentives we provide to issuers or acquirers or directly to merchants any of these eventualities could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

interchange reimbursement fees and related practices have been receiving significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide and the resulting regulations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in a payments network such as ours in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders they are typically paid by acquirers the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants we refer to a system like ours in which a payment network intermediates between the issuer and the acquirer as an openloop system 

  

we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fees they are however a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process over our network consequently changes to these fees can have a substantial impact on our revenues we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees in the united states and other countries however in certain jurisdictions interchange rates and related practices are subject to increased government regulation increased regulatory scrutiny in the united states has already resulted in limitations on our ability to establish default interchange rates in the debit area see— the us wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business in addition interchange rates have become subject to increased scrutiny elsewhere and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing them these include australia canada brazil and south africa 

if we cannot set default interchange rates at optimal levels issuers and acquirers may find our payments system unattractive this could materially lower overall transaction volumes it could also materially increase the attraction of closedloop payments systems—those with direct connections to both merchants and consumers—and other forms of payment in addition issuers could begin to charge higher fees to consumers this would make our card programs less desirable and reduce our transaction volumes and profitability acquirers could elect to charge higher discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer visa cardholders to alternate payment systems in addition issuers and acquirers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking incentives from us or a reduction in the fees that we charge any of the foregoing could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the us wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

the wall street reform and consumer protection act recently enacted in the united states includes provisions that will regulate the selection of payment networks by issuers and the routing of debit transactions by retailers this may result in the routing of debit transactions onto competing networks potentially reducing the processing fees we earn on debit transactions 

the legislation also establishes regulation and oversight by the us federal reserve board of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices in addition the federal reserve now has the power to regulate network fees to the extent necessary to prevent evasion of the new rules on interchange rates 

the act also created a new independent consumer financial protection bureau within the federal reserve system the bureau will assume responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services and will have new authorities with respect to consumer issues the bureau’s actions may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers this could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues 

the new legislation may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business failure by our clients or by us successfully to adjust our strategies to compete in the new environment would increase this impact 

  

new regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions this includes the recent us wall street reform and consumer protection act similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations like those affecting debit payments could eventually spread to regulate credit 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment these include matters like interchange rates network exclusivity and preferred routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business with the same effect either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries provide resources or protection to selected national payment card and processing providers these governments may take this action in order to support these providers they may also take this action to keep us from entering these countries to force us to leave or to restrict substantially our activities there for example china a significant emerging market has increasingly tightened its rules requiring use of its payment system for domestic transactions additionally governments in certain countries are considering or may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments entirely in that country this would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for our clients our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brands 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and our revenues 

recently privacy data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states at the federal and state level and in other countries for example in many jurisdictions consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach these measures may materially increase our costs and our clients’ costs they may also decrease the number of our cards our clients issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our clients to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brands 

if government regulators determine that we are a “systemically important payments system” we may have to change our settlement procedures or other operations making it costlier to operate our business and reducing our operational flexibility 

a number of international initiatives are underway to maintain financial stability by strengthening financial infrastructure the committee on payment and settlement systems of the central banks of the group of ten countries has developed a set of core principles for “systemically important payment systems” government regulators in the united states or elsewhere may determine that we are a 

  

systemically important payments system and impose settlement riskmanagement requirements on us these could include new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks they could also include new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system any of these developments could increase the cost of operating our business 

recent increased global regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on our clients and on us leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues 

regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years examples include 

 

  

  

  

  

 complying with these and other regulations may increase our costs similarly the impact of such regulations on our clients may reduce the volume of payments we process moreover such regulations could limit the types of products and services that we offer the countries in which our cards are used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business prospects for future growth financial condition and results of operations 

litigation risks 

a finding of liability in the interchange litigation may result in substantial damages 

since 2005 approximately 55 class actions and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against us mastercard andor other defendants including certain financial institutions that issue visabranded payment cards and acquire visabranded payment transactions in the us we refer to this as the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegations the plaintiffs allege that 

  

visa’s setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws the lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york 

the plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiffs estimate that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and we may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established this could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment 

the interchange litigation is part of the covered litigation that our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address the retrospective responsibility plan may not however adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements of or judgments in the interchange litigation failure to successfully defend or settle the interchange litigation would result in liability that to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent in addition even if our retrospective responsibility plan covered our direct financial exposure settlements or judgments involving the multidistrict litigation could include restrictions on our ability to conduct business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth see— our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements and judgments in the covered litigation and will not insulate us from other pending or future litigation and see note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments 

our retrospective responsibility plan addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation which is described in note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements or judgments in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offerings of our shares of class a common stock or deposits of cash to the escrow account in lieu of such offerings a losssharing agreement and a judgmentsharing agreement in addition our us members are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique and complicated and if we cannot use one or more of them we could have difficulty funding the payment of a settlement or final judgment against us in a covered litigation this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

the retrospective responsibility plan only addresses the covered litigation the plan does not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation in addition our retrospective responsibility plan covers only the potential monetary liability from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation nonmonetary settlement terms and judgments in the covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business in the future this could adversely affect our revenues increase our expenses andor limit our prospects for growth therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan adequately safeguards us from the monetary impact of settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation it may not insulate us from all potential adverse consequences of them 

  

if the settlements of our currency conversion cases do not become final and we are unsuccessful in any of the various lawsuits relating to visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

visa usa and visa international are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that their currency conversion practices are or were deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful 

on july 20 2006 and september 14 2006 visa usa and visa international entered into agreements to settle or otherwise dispose of these matters under the settlement agreements visa usa paid approximately 100 million as part of the defendants’ settlement fund for the federal actions and approximately 19 million to fund settlement of the state cases although the federal court has granted final approval of the settlement agreements the settlements are subject to resolution of any appeals if we are unsuccessful in any appellate proceeding all of the agreements resolving the federal and state actions will terminate if that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against some or all of these lawsuits on the merits we may have to pay restitution damages or both and we may be required to modify our currency conversion practices the potential amount of damages restitution or both could be substantial in addition although we have substantially changed the practices at issue in these litigations courtordered changes to our currency conversion and crossborder transaction practices could materially and adversely affect our business see note 22 — legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

if we are found liable in certain other pending or future lawsuits we may have to pay substantial damages or change our business practices or pricing structure which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

like many large companies we are a defendant in a number of civil actions and investigations alleging violations of competitionantitrust law securities law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others these lawsuits and investigations have been initiated by a wide variety of parties including the us department of justice or the doj us state attorneys general merchants and consumers examples of such claims are described more fully in note 22 — legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report some lawsuits involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore we cannot ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damages accordingly we have not established allowances for such legal proceedings 

in the united states private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us this is particularly so in cases involving merchants and consumers due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit monetary damages could be significant 

if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future proceedings we may have to pay substantial damages limit the fees we charge or change other business practices this could limit our payments volume and result in a material and adverse effect on our revenues results of operations cash flow financial conditions prospects for future growth and overall business and could even cause us to become insolvent 

limitations on our business that resulted from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation for example in october 2010 we reached a settlement subject to court approval with the antitrust division of the doj and a number of state attorneys general relating to their investigation of certain visa merchant acceptance practices under the agreement visa will allow us merchants to offer discounts or other incentives to steer cardholders to a particular form of payment including to a specific 

  

network brand or to any card product such as a “nonreward” visa credit card see note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the agreement does not address surcharging or the setting of default interchange and does not preclude the doj from pursuing a future investigation of these or other topics similarly as a result of the june 2003 settlement of a us merchant lawsuit against visa usa merchants are able to reject our consumer debit cards in the united states while still accepting other visabranded cards and vice versa 

these and other limitations on our business that were the result of settlements of or judgments in litigation could limit the fees we charge and reduce our payments volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

tax audits or disputes or changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may decrease their accuracy we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and we may be subject to additional audits in the future the tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax burden could have a material adverse effect on our financial results see also note 21 — income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

our agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities 

under our framework agreement with visa europe we indemnify it for losses resulting from all claims outside its region arising from our or their activities and relating to our or their payments business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents participated in the actions giving rise to such claims such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities 

business risks 

the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 

we offer incentives to clients in order to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand our card base these include upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased incentives marketing support payments and other support over the past several years we have increased the use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives this pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and profitability 

pressure on client pricing also poses indirect risks presenting the potential for the same adverse effects if we continue to increase incentives to our clients we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume the amount of feebased services we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from longterm contracts with certain clients including those that are large contributors to our 

  

revenue continued pressure on our fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on favorable terms we may also have to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships or comply with regulations finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those surrounding client incentives and we may not succeed in these efforts 

our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer because of intense competition in our industry 

the global payments industry is intensely competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment these include cash checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automatic clearinghouse payments in addition our payment programs compete against the cardbased payments systems of our competitors such as mastercard american express discover and privatelabel cards issued by merchants 

some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have they may offer a wider range of programs and services than we do they may use advertising and marketing strategies that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do they may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements than we have they may also introduce more innovative programs and services than we provide 

certain of our competitors operate with different business models have different cost structures or participate selectively in different market segments these include domestic networks in the united states china canada australia and other countries and regions they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other developments in many cases these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transactions within those countries and regions 

our clients can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services this is especially so given the recent us wall street reform and consumer protection act which restricts our ability to require network exclusivity in the debit sector most of our larger client relationships are not exclusive these include those with our largest clients jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstances our clients may terminate these relationships sometimes on relatively short notice and in many cases subject to significant early termination fees because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations see note 15—enterprisewide disclosure and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

we expect there to be changes in the competitive landscape in the future for example 

 

  

  

  

   

our failure to compete effectively against any of these threats could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

disintermediation from the payments value chain would harm our business 

our position in the payments value chain underpins our business certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and no intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from this business model in addition they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as operators of multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that would rather not use a payment network for processing payments for example merchants could process transactions directly with issuers or processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers 

additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fees we charge our clients materially and adversely affecting our revenues and profitability 

the banking industry has recently undergone substantial accelerated consolidation which could continue significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest clients by an institution with a strong relationship with one of our competitors this could result in the acquired bank’s visa business shifting to that competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business to us in addition one or more of our clients could merge with or acquire one of our competitors shifting its payments volume to that competitor any such transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our clients and potential clients and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining clients and potential clients this consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us in addition consolidation could prompt our existing clients to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our clients absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volumebased discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses pressure on the fees we charge our clients caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business in addition the current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone nearterm investments in growing their card portfolios limit credit lines or take other actions that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients 

merchants’ continued focus on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangements 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a group of larger merchants that is having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry some merchants are seeking to reduce their costs associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation if they continue these efforts could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business 

  

we along with our clients negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance and usage of our payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate our clients and we may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants this could materially and adversely affect our revenues results of operations prospects for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentives 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our clients which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

failure to maintain relationships with our clients and others and failure of clients to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business 

we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our clients and on their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if any or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not generally solicit merchants to accept our cards and we do not establish the discount rates charged to merchants for card acceptance which rates are the responsibility of acquirers as a result the success of our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our clients and the strength of our relationships with them 

in many countries outside the united states our clients or other processors authorize clear and settle most domestic transactions using our payment cards without involving our processing systems in addition we do not generally have direct relationships with merchants and do not have direct relationships with cardholders consequently we depend on our close working relationships with our clients to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving our cards our inability to control the endtoend processing for cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brands 

in addition we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf and to the extent that thirdparty vendors fail to deliver services our business and reputation could be impaired 

our perception in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation which are key assets of our business 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to visabranded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our clients that change the perception of our brands from time to time our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be subject to challenge which may materially and adversely affect our business further visa europe has very broad latitude to operate the visa business in and use our brands and technology within visa europe’s region in which we have only limited control over the operation of the visa business visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the visa brands 

  

in its region and the strength of the visa global brands depends in part on the efforts of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe finally adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny 

unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients merchants and cardholders resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events that began in 2008 continue to affect the financial markets around the world this includes decreased consumer spending increased unemployment deflation increased savings decreased debt excess housing inventory lowered government spending less export activity continued challenges in the credit environment continued equity market volatility additional government intervention and the uncertainty arising from new government policies this economic turmoil has affected the economies of the united states and other mature economies in particular 

the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic developments were to arise these could include among other things policy missteps exhaustion of us and other national economic stimulus packages dramatic increases in oil prices tax increases economic turmoil in china the euro zone or japan or a significant decline in the commercial real estate market 

some existing clients have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential changes in laws and regulations many of our clients merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely affected 

our financial results may be negatively affected by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present as a result our revenue growth has been and may be negatively affected or we may be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in addition regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry 

any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

a decline in nonus and crossborder activity and in multicurrency transactions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as we generate a significant portion of our revenue from such transactions 

we generate a significant amount of our revenues from crossborder transactions our clients pay us fees in connection with crossborder transactions some of those fees may differ if conversion from the merchant’s currency to the cardholder’s billing currency is required thus revenue from processing crossborder transactions for our clients fluctuates with crossborder travel and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism natural disasters the effects of climate change and outbreaks of diseases a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability a decline in the need for conversion of currencies might also adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activities that result from our clients’ settlement in different currencies a reduction in multicurrency transactions may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activities and adversely affect our revenues 

transactions outside the united states represent an increasingly important part of our strategy in order to continue to grow in those areas we will need to ensure that we maintain consistency in the types of products we provide the quality of our service and the viability of our brand if we cannot employ our organizational resources effectively we will be unable to do so 

finally because we are domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we risk loss or insolvency if our clients fail to fund settlement obligations we have guaranteed 

we indemnify issuers and acquirers for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of our indemnification obligations are unlimited 

concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients or several of our smaller clients may exceed our available financial resources as could systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a 

  

settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose us to significant losses materially and adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we estimate settlement at risk or exposure based on the sum of three inputs the first is average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin the second is four months of rolling average chargebacks volume the third is the total balance for outstanding traveler’s cheques additionally from time to time we review and revise our risk management methodology and inputs as necessary see note 13—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

some of our clients are composed of groups of financial institutions some of these clients have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we cannot process transactions efficiently the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism climate change or accident our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks leading to an interruption in service increased costs or the compromise of data security additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require because of a natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline reducing our revenues and net income 

rapid significant technological changes are confronting the payments industry these include developments in smart cards ecommerce mobile commerce and radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industrywide standards by resistance to change from clients or merchants or by third parties’ intellectual property rights our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

account data breaches involving card data stored by third parties or by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues 

our clients merchants others and we store cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards in addition our clients may use thirdparty processors to process transactions 

  

generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems storing sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visabranded cards to reputational damage and to claims against us if we are sued in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may have to pay damages or change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our clients merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our costs 

an increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information they use the information to conduct fraudulent transactions outsourcing and specialization of functions within the payments system are increasing as a result more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards a rise in fraud levels involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands this could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs 

failure to maintain interoperability between visa inc’s and visa europe’s authorization and clearing and settlement systems could damage the business and global perception of the visa brands 

before our reorganization in october 2007 visa europe and we shared authorization clearing and settlement systems visa europe completed and substantially deployed its own systems in the 2010 fiscal year as a result visa europe and we will have to ensure that the two systems can process every transaction regardless of where it originates visa europe’s newly independent system operations could present challenges to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems as they diverge over time failure to authorize or clear and settle transactions quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the visa brands 

risks related to our structure and organization 

we have little ability to control visa europe’s operations and limited recourse if it breaches its obligations to us 

visa europe has very broad rights to operate the visa business in its region under the agreement that governs our relationship if we want to change a global rule or require visa europe to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for visa europe and its members then visa europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that visa europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation 

if visa europe fails to meet its obligations our remedies under this agreement are limited we cannot terminate the agreement even upon visa europe’s material uncured breach although we have a call right to acquire visa europe we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstances 

these and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of tax treatment of entry into the licenses and payments received thereunder 

  

in some instances as in the case of cybersource visa europe may have the right to control the activities of newly acquired entities within visa europe’s territory in any event visa europe’s exclusive license rights in europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entities or to operate them effectively 

any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we can provide could negatively affect cardholders from visa europe using cards in the countries we serve or our cardholders using cards in visa europe’s region 

if visa europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock we will incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income 

we have granted visa europe a put option requiring us to purchase all outstanding capital stock from its members if exercised we will incur a substantial financial obligation if visa europe exercises this option visa europe may do so at any time we may need to obtain thirdparty financing in order to meet our obligation by either borrowing funds or selling stock an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders we would have only 285 days to pay the exercise price sufficient financing might not be available to us within that time on reasonable terms see note 3—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

if visa europe exercises the put option we may encounter difficulties in integrating visa europe’s business and systems into our existing operations if we cannot do so quickly and costeffectively the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we would become subject to the many regulations of the european union that govern the operations of visa europe including any regulatory disputes 

we are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option we record these adjustments through our consolidated statements of operations consequently the adjustments affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these changes could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the costs involved in raising it 

if we cannot remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment 

since our reorganization in october 2007 we have increasingly centralized our management and operations for us to succeed we must effectively integrate our operations actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization and avoid uscentric thinking if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand as rapidly as we plan and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory 

in addition the current competitive economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunities and challenges we will be unable to do so if we do not make important decisions quickly enough define our appetite for risk specifically enough implement new governance managerial and organizational processes smoothly enough and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly enough 

we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employees 

our employees particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets adversely affecting our business 

  

acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations 

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses products or technologies we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them the integration of the recently acquired cybersource corporation will take time and resources that would otherwise have been available for other acquisitions we will be subject to the terms of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisitions and major investments that involve countries in the visa europe territory regulatory constraints particularly competition regulations may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisitions or investments 

furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues moreover our cash reserves contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions and investments 

future sales of our class a common stock or the expiration or waiver of transfer restrictions on our class b and c common stock could result in dilution to holders of shares of our existing class a common stock adversely affecting their rights and depressing the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price and voting power of our class a common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding the market price of our class a common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur such as upon the issuance or conversion of securities convertible to shares of our class a common stock specifically on march 25 2011 all of our restricted shares of class c common stock will become transferable at once 

if funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class a common stock will be diluted 

under our retrospective responsibility plan funds still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to us at that time each share of class b common stock will become convertible into an increased number of shares of class a common stock benefitting the holders of class b common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest in visa inc held by the holders of class a common stock the amount of this dilution will depend on the amount if any of the funds released from the escrow account and the market price of our class a common stock near the time the funds are released 

shares of class a common stock acquired by visa members and certain affiliates and competitors convert automatically into shares of class c common stock which have limited voting rights and may be subject to restrictions on transfer 

shares of class a common stock acquired by a visa member an affiliate of a visa member or any person that is a competitor or its affiliate in each case to the extent acting as a principal investor convert automatically into shares of class c common stock some shares of class c common stock cannot be transferred until march 25 2011 in addition holders of shares of our class c common stock do not have the right to vote on certain matters including the election of directors 

  

holders of our shares of our class b and c common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class a common stock 

although their voting rights are limited holders of shares of our class b and c common stock can vote on certain significant transactions these include a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business and any other vote required by law the holders of these shares may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable for instance except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance in addition except for common stock issued to a member in connection with our reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock shares held by a competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may not exceed 5 of our total outstanding shares on an asconverted basis 

our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

since august 2008 we have paid cash dividends quarterly on our class a b and c common stock any future payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant if because of these factors we cannot generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may be unable to make payments of dividends of our common stock furthermore no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class of common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend this management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of visa inc and its subsidiaries “visa” “we” “our” and the “company” on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings as well as those factors that may affect future earnings the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses banks and governments around the world enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks we provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit debit prepaid and commercial payments we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions merchants consumers businesses and government entities each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic forms of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities particularly outside the united states we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position visa to serve more and different constituencies 

overall economic conditions and regulatory environment our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending we continue to monitor the progress of the global economic recovery which has shown signs of slow but gradual improvement we expect consumer and commercial spending and our payments volume to continue to increase in the near term if the economic recovery maintains momentum 

the wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in the us in july 2010 includes provisions that will establish regulation and oversight of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices in the us while the legislation does not directly regulate the network fees we charge except to ensure that fees are not used to evade the new regulation of interchange rates it may give retailers greater ability to route debit transactions onto competitive networks which can reduce the processing fees we currently earn on debit transactions because the implementation details for this new legislation will be determined over the next year the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements is unknown at this time however we expect to see the impacts of the legislation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

other regulatory measures previously enacted in the us became effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 these regulatory measures primarily impacted our clients but have not resulted in any notable impact to our payments volumes 

we continue to believe that our broad platform of payment products provides substantial value to both retailers and consumers and that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency will buffer the impacts of our current regulatory environment as reflected in our overall payments volume growth and in particular payments volume growth outside the us 

funding of the litigation escrow account during may 2010 and subsequently in october 2010 after our fiscal year end we deposited 500 million and 800 million respectively into the escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan or the plan under the terms of the plan when visa funds the escrow account the shares of class b common stock retained by our 

  

us clients and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock on an asconverted basis funding of the escrow account had the effect of our repurchasing approximately 7 million shares and 11 million shares of class a common stock respectively see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements 

share repurchase plan in october 2009 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase plan as of september 30 2010 we have drawn on the entire 10 billion authorized amount by repurchasing a total of 129 million shares of our class a common stock at an average price of 7748 per share in october 2010 subsequent to our fiscal year end our board of directors authorized a second 10 billion share repurchase plan which will be in place through september 30 2011 subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors see the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion 

expansion of our ecommerce capabilities on july 21 2010 we completed our acquisition of cybersource corporation a leading provider of electronic payment risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants at a price of 2600 per share the total purchase consideration was approximately 20 billion paid with cash on hand the acquisition of cybersource will expand our online payment fraud and security management capabilities and is expected to accelerate our growth in the ecommerce category the results of cybersource are included in our results from the acquisition date see note 6—cybersource acquisition to our consolidated financial statements 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts we believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues the growth in nominal payments volume in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 in particular credit and debit was primarily driven by growth outside the us comparing fiscal 2009 with fiscal 2008 nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal yearoveryear nominal payments volume impact 

the number of processed transactions continues to increase reflecting the continued shift to electronic payments globally 

the payments volume and processed transactions tables presented below do not include cybersource volumes and transactions cybersource activities primarily contribute to our data processing revenues which is discussed below in results of operations  

  

this table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars 1  

 

  

  

      

this table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our visanet system during the following fiscal periods 

 

 results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visabranded cards for goods and services as well as the number size and type of transactions processed on our visanet system we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest and fees paid by cardholders on visabranded cards our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders and most other competitive card features we do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance including the merchant discount rate our acquiring clients which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants establish and earn these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues are earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the visa brand service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and visa europe data processing revenues are primarily based on information we accumulate from visanet our secure centralized global processing platform which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers data processing revenues also include revenues earned for transactions processed by cybersource’s online payment gateway 

international transaction revenues are assessed to clients on transactions where the cardholder’s issuer country is different from the merchant’s country international transaction revenues are generally driven by crossborder payments volume which includes single currency transactions and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency 

other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement and fees from cardholder services and licensing and certification other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services 

volume and support incentives represent contracts with clients merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance these incentives are accounted for as reductions to operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel includes salaries stockbased compensation incentives fringe benefits and contractor expense 

  

network edp and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

advertising marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the visa brand 

professional and consulting fees consists of fees for consulting legal and other professional services 

depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our october 2007 reorganization and the incremental basis in technology and other assets including finitelived intangible assets acquired in our july 2010 acquisition of cybersource the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our october 2007 reorganization was fully depreciated and amortized at september 30 2010 

administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business 

litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile the specifics of the case advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates 

other income expense 

interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt 

investment income net represents returns on our fixedincome securities and other investments investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost method investments 

other nonoperating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the visa europe put option also included in this amount is the change in the fair value of the liability under the framework agreement with visa europe which was fully discharged in october 2008 

visa inc fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the united states in the rest of the world and from visa europe revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services 

 

  

   

growth in operating revenues primarily reflects an increase in nominal payments volume continued growth of processed transactions and the impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model the benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to volume and support incentives we continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as part of the overall global economic recovery and evaluate the potential impacts to operating revenues under our current regulatory environment we may adjust our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our clients 

revenues from processing crossborder transactions for our clients fluctuate with crossborder travel and the extent to which visabranded products are utilized for travel purposes crossborder transactions have shown signs of improvement in all geographies during fiscal 2010 

our operating revenues primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to us dollars the effect of the general weakening of the us dollar during fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities resulting in a net 1 increase in total operating revenues in comparison the general strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal 2009 net against the impact from our hedging activities resulted in a 3 decline in total operating revenues as we are substantially hedged through fiscal 2011 we do not expect any significant impact from currency fluctuations next year 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues 

 

  

  

 service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of fiscal 2009 combined with modest growth of 1 in nominal global payments volume 

 

   

 data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to 8 growth in the number of transactions processed during the year combined with other strategic pricing modifications 

 

 international transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11 decline in crossborder nominal payments volume primarily due to strategic pricing modifications made after fiscal 2008 

 

 other revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to growth in the visa extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform 

 

 volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant longterm customer contracts these incentives were partially offset by the absence of a nonrecurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008 

  

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented 

 

  

  

 the decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions combined with reduced contractor fees and employee incentiverelated costs in fiscal 2009 

 

  

 in fiscal 2009 expenses decreased despite the launch of our global “more people go with visa” campaign reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost 

 

 the decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in fiscal 2008 in connection with our global reorganization and ipo and related insourcing of professional services 

  

 the decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of depreciation and amortization for assets in our colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008 partially offset by additional depreciation in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center 

 

 administrative and other expenses remained flat in fiscal 2009 primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy 

 

 the decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of litigation provision recorded in connection with the discover settlement in fiscal 2008 see note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 

other income expense 

the following table sets forth the components of our other income expense for the periods presented 

 

  

  

   

 the increase in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the pretax gain of 473 million discussed above partially offset by lower interest income earned from lower investment balances after funding our october 2008 stock redemptions 

 

 other nonoperating income in fiscal 2008 reflects adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the framework agreement with visa europe which was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009 

effective income tax rate 

the effective tax rate decreased to 36 in fiscal 2010 compared with 41 in fiscal 2009 and 40 in fiscal 2008 

the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income the benefit of tax incentives in singapore our largest operating hub outside the us the nontaxable revaluation of the visa europe put option in fiscal 2010 and the additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in visanet do brasil in fiscal 2009 

the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in visanet do brasil 

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios to ensure payments on required litigation settlements to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities to make planned capital investments in our business to pay dividends to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are highquality and marketable in the short term 

based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

  

cash flow data 

this table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years 

 

 operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income including noncontrolling interest of 30 billion and adjustments for noncash items of 21 billion offset by payments for volume and support incentives and litigation settlements primarily including 682 million prepayment of our retailers’ litigation obligation as further discussed below total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher yeartodate net income and lower litigation settlement payments we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will sufficiently meet our ongoing operational needs 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income including noncontrolling interest of 24 billion and adjustments for noncash items of 15 billion standard noncash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a 473 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in visanet do brasil which is reflected in investing activities cash from operating activities also reflects the use of 33 billion to fund significant operational payments including litigation and volume and support incentives 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income including noncontrolling interest of 804 million and adjustments for noncash items of 31 billion cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations reflecting the use of cash to satisfy litigation settlement payments and volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals 

investing activities cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of cybersource in july 2010 for 18 billion net of cash received the use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of 56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities compared to 290 million in the prior year both of which were reinvested in money market funds we also received 89 million in cash distributions from the reserve primary fund or the fund in the current year compared to 884 million of distributions in the prior year as the fund liquidated 

cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the 884 million of cash distribution from the fund net cash proceeds of 290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and 10 billion from the sale of our 10 ownership in visanet do brasil all of which were reinvested in money market funds we also purchased 306 million of property equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center 

cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008 reflects 10 billion of cash acquired through the reorganization 949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were reinvested in shorterterm cash equivalents and 415 million of property 

  

equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center in addition we reclassified our 953 million investment in the fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet see further discussion under sources of liquidity below and note 7—prepaid expenses and other assets to our consolidated financial statements 

financing activities cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects 1 billion in repurchases of class a common stock in the open market funding of 500 million to the litigation escrow account and 368 million of dividend payments 

cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractuallyrequired redemption of certain of our series class c common shares for 26 billion funding of 18 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of 318 million offset by covered litigation payments totaling 20 billion from the litigation escrow account 

cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributable to iporelated activities including 191 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class a common stock offset by 134 billion used for the partial redemption of class b and class c common stock and 30 billion payment to the litigation escrow account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements in addition there was a source of cash of 11 billion reflecting covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account offset by 93 million and 22 million for dividend and routine debt payments respectively 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations an investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investment securities or longterm availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and return that these holdings provide 

investment portfolio our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities including money market funds and debt securities issued by us governmentsponsored agencies the liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 

other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities rates of default of the underlying assets underlying collateral value discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

revolving credit facilities on february 15 2008 we entered into a 30 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class b and class c common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients loans under the fiveyear facility may be in the form of 1 base rate advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus 05 and the bank of america prime rate 2 eurocurrency advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to libor as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 011 to 030 based 

  

on our credit rating or 3 us swing loan euro swing loan or foreign currency swing loan which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable swing loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for euro and sterling loans an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment we also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount whether used or unused at a rate ranging from 004 to 010 and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 005 to 010 based on our credit rating currently the applicable margin is 015 the facility fee is 005 and the utilization fee is 005 this facility contains certain covenants including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to ebitda and events of default customary for financings of this type this facility expires on february 15 2013 there were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2010 

us commercial paper programs  we maintain a 500 million us commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings the commercial paper program is a source of shortterm borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover shortterm cash needs we had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2010 there are no financial covenants related to this program 

universal shelf registration statement on may 6 2009 we filed a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission using a shelf registration process as permitted by the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions the registration statement expires on may 5 2012 

escrow account we maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters when the company funds the escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2010 was 19 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet in october 2010 after the end of our 2010 fiscal year we deposited an additional 800 million into the escrow account as these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters we have not included them as part of our liquid assets however they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2010 standard and poor’s and moody’s rated our unsecured debt as follows 

 

 various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

  

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the us dollar us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance these settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions we maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement typically the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in december and early january during the holiday shopping season 

covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation as noted above settlements of or judgments in covered litigation are paid from the escrow account see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan and note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements  as well as sources of liquidity  in fiscal 2010 we made 280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs for example in connection with our retailers’ litigation settlement in fiscal 2003 we were required to make annual settlement payments of 200 million through fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2009 we entered into an agreement to prepay our remaining payment obligations under the original retailers’ litigation settlement agreement we made a payment of 682 million to fully satisfy the remaining 800 million obligation in october 2009 

share repurchase plan during fiscal 2010 we used 10 billion to repurchase approximately 129 million shares of our class a common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized in october 2009 in october 2010 after the end of our 2010 fiscal year our board of directors authorized a second 10 billion share repurchase plan to be in place through september 30 2011 subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares 

dividends  during fiscal 2010 we paid 368 million in dividends on october 20 2010 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 015 per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 107 million in connection with this dividend in december 2010 see note 16—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements we anticipate continuing to pay quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by our board of directors class b and class c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

visa europe put option we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies visa inc’s forward pricetoearnings multiple or the pe ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 

  

at september 30 2010 we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately 267 million while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2010 it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollars or more we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our pe ratio in each case as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 

given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purposes only a range of pe ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates 75 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the 75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below for illustrative purposes only is based on visa europe’s forecasted financial results for the year ended september 30 2010 however this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september 30 2010 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise its option we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a forprofit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and as a result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated pe ratios for each 25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed 75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september 30 2010 our estimated longterm pe ratio was 188 and the longterm pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe was 35 at september 30 2010 the spot pe ratio was 157 and the spot pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe was 16 these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future 

 

  

 pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service age and eligible compensation employees hired before january 1 2008 earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment employees hired or rehired on or after january 1 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula effective january 1 2011 all employees will accrue benefits under the cash balance formula and will cease to accrue benefits under any other formula we also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act or erisa our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are 

  

funded on a current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 66 million 170 million and 190 million respectively in fiscal 2011 we anticipate to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately 60 million the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movements in the discount rate performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2010 reflecting the completion of our new east coast data center in fiscal 2009 the new data center supports our technology objectives related to reliability scalability security and new product development we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 250 million to 275 million in fiscal 2011 as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure 

acquisition of cybersource on july 21 2010 we completed our acquisition of cybersource corporation for approximately 20 billion in cash or 18 billion net of cash received the combination is expected to accelerate the growth of our ecommerce category and enhance the value of our network product and service offerings to financial institutions merchants partners and consumers see note 6—cybersource acquisition to our consolidated financial statements 

other uses in addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness our total outstanding principal balance of debt at september 30 2010 net of unamortized issuance costs was 44 million 

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability as of september 30 2010 our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 57 billion of assets of which 13 million or less than 1 had significant unobservable inputs for these instruments we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes at september 30 2010 debt instruments in this category included auction rate securities see note 5—investments and fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements primarily comprise guarantees visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

guarantees and indemnifications 

in 2001 visa international entered into a 20year lease agreement for premises in london to be occupied by visa europe and what is now the headquarters for our central and eastern europe middle east and africa operations the lease is assigned to visa europe services inc or vesi a whollyowned subsidiary of visa europe with visa international acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the united kingdom in the event of a default by vesi visa international is obligated to make base lease payments vesi has agreed to reimburse visa international for any liabilities that may arise under visa international’s guarantee to the landlord visa international has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than 1 million at september 30 2010 

  

we indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor visa cards traveler’s cheques or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations the amount of the indemnification is unlimited we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 13—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement see note 19—commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at september 30 2010 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities see note 3—visa europe note 11—debt note 12—pension postretirement and other benefits note 19—commitments and contingencies  and note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements  

 

  

      

     critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition—volume and support incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with clients merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance these incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance other incentives are based 

  

on fixed payments and are generally deferred if certain criteria are met the deferability criteria include the existence of future benefits to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability 

assumptions and judgment estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume estimates of card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our clients 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if our clients’ actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2010 performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1 of our total operating revenues 

fair value—visa europe put option 

critical estimates we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option under which if exercised we are required to purchase all of the share capital of visa europe from its members at any time the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares which subject to certain adjustments applies visa inc’s forward pricetoearnings multiple as defined in the agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12month period or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 

upon exercise the key inputs to this formula including visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between the company and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note 3—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 

the fair value of visa europe’s option was estimated to be approximately 267 million at september 30 2010 while the put option is in fact nontransferable this amount recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction at the measurement date the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the terms of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arm’s length transaction under normal business conditions a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option 

while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2010 it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollars or more see the liquidity and capital resources section of management’s discussion and analysis for further discussion 

  

assumptions and judgment the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to as the pe differential 

probability of exercise —exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under its articles of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to i visa europe’s stated intentions ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results iii evaluation of market conditions including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europe’s largest members which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

pe differential —the pe differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward pricetoearnings multiples applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purposes the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors quantitatively we estimate our pe ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months the “longterm pe calculation” and the last 30 trading dates the “30day pe calculation” prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers’ estimate system ibes we then determine the best estimate of our longterm pricetoearnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30day pe calculation as compared to the longterm pe calculation in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences if any are the result of a fundamental change in longterm value of the company or the result of shortterm market volatility or other noncompany specific market factors that may not be indicative of our longterm forward pe we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that a market participant would more heavily weight longterm value indicators as opposed to shortterm indicators 

factors that might indicate a fundamental change in longterm value include but are not limited to changes in the regulatory environment client portfolio longterm growth rates or new product innovation a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market’s expectations of the future earnings of visa inc and the comparable companies 

other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europe’s current business model as an association owned by its member banks while the highest reflect a successful shift to a forprofit model in anticipation of exercise the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that should it choose to exercise its option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a forprofit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe’s results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled 

  

scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2010 we have assumed a 40 probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 35x the use of a probability of exercise that is 5 higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 33 million in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 81 million in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe as such the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2010 classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management’s expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months 

fair value—goodwill and intangible assets 

critical estimates we are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including intangible assets in a business combination the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill we are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment 

assumptions and judgment judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations including goodwill and intangible assets can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management we believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management’s judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors including the competitive environment market share customer history and macroeconomic situation we determined that our visa brand customer relationships and visa europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives based on our significant market share history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and historical retention rates as a result of acquiring cybersource in july 2010 we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships tradenames and reseller relationships which we determined have finite useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years see note 6—cybersource acquisition and note 9 – intangible assets net to our consolidated financial statements our assets acquired liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level 

indefinitelived intangible assets  annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist we test each category of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis which may require the allocation of cash flows andor an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows business plans and use of present value techniques as of july 1 2010 we evaluated our indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date no recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization 

finitelived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group an impairment loss is recognized the loss is 

  

measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value no events or changes in circumstances indicate that finitelived intangible assets were impaired as of september 30 2010 

goodwill review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist goodwill impairment is reviewed using a twostep process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows business plans and use of present value techniques we evaluated our goodwill for impairment on july 1 2010 and concluded there was no impairment as of that date subsequent to this annual assessment we completed the cybersource acquisition on july 21 2010 which resulted in an additional 12 billion in goodwill and established a second reporting unit we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition of the 12 billion approximately 08 billion was allocated to the second reporting unit the remainder was allocated to our original reporting unit to reflect the incremental growth and synergy this acquisition will provide to our existing business no recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exist as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates we may be exposed to impairment charges the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets net were 114 billion and 115 billion respectively including 109 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets and 595 million of finitelived intangible assets net at september 30 2010 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party we record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation the plan’s mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance we did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2010 see note 4— retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial conditions and results of operations see note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the american express litigation and the discover litigation and other matters see note 22—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis we do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currencydenominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies primarily for expenses at our nonus locations we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated nonus dollar denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

we utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was 627 million and 742 million at september 30 2010 and september 30 2009 respectively the aggregate notional amount of 627 million outstanding at september 30 2010 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10 change of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately 55 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2010 see note 14 — derivatives financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 

  

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity our operating results or cash flows have not been and are not expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 

the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 135 million and 176 million respectively a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at september 30 2010 the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 13 million and 34 million at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 

we also have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the debt by approximately 1 million at september 30 2010 

visa europe put option 

we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair market value at september 30 2010 we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2010 we have assumed a 40 probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 35x the use of a probability of exercise 5 higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 33 million in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 81 million in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 

pension plan risks 

our us defined benefit pension plan assets were 766 million and 703 million and projected benefit obligations were 743 million and 739 million at september 30 2010 and september 30 2009 respectively a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets andor the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2011 which we expect to make in september 2011

industry overview 

the global payments industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which is undergoing a major shift from paperbased payments such as cash and checks to cardbased and other electronic payments for more than 30 years visa has played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers businesses governments and merchants we believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience security enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms we also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency control and security and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience 

the global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer including 

 

  

  

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are generalpurpose cards which offer widespread merchant acceptance general purpose cards are typically categorized as 

 

   

  

 the primary global general purpose card brands include visa mastercard american express discover jcb and diners club while these brands—including visa—were historically associated primarily with consumer credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets visa and others have over time broadened their offerings to include debit atm prepaid and commercial cards 

our primary operations 

we generate revenue from the transaction processing services we offer to our customers our customers deliver visa products and payment services to consumers and merchants based on the product platforms we define and manage payments network management is a core part of our operations as it ensures that our payments system provides a safe efficient consistent and interoperable service to cardholders merchants and financial institutions worldwide 

transaction processing services 

processing infrastructure 

we own and operate visanet which consists of three synchronized processing centers including a new data center on the east coast of the united states that replaced an existing data center in march 2009 in addition visa europe operates one processing center in the united kingdom which is part of our synchronized system in accordance with the terms of our framework agreement with visa europe these centers are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and valueadded services 

visanet is built on a centralized architecture enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and provide valueadded information such as risk scoring or loyalty applications while the transaction data is being routed through our system 

core processing services 

our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between visa issuers which are the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders and acquirers which are the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants in addition we offer a range of valueadded processing services to support our customers’ visa programs and to promote the growth and security of the visa payments network 

authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholder’s account the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies settlement is the process of calculating determining reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared 

  

the issuer and acquirer involved in a typical visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor for example the acquirer credits the merchant’s account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer in addition the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment in the case of a credit or deferred debit card or collects payment directly from the cardholder’s deposit account in the case of a debit card 

we process virtually all visa transactions occurring in the united states we also process virtually all visa crossborder transactions that is transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries in many countries outside the united states domestic transactions may be processed outside of our systems generally by governmentcontrolled payments networks our financial institution customers independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our financial institution customers 

we perform clearing and settlement through visanet for transactions involving an issuer that is located in visa europe’s region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world or vice versa in addition we currently provide clearing and settlement services for visa transactions occurring entirely within visa europe’s region and will continue to provide such services until completion and deployment of visa europe’s own processing system which is expected to be fully deployed in fiscal 2010 the impact to our consolidated financial results as a result of this deployment is not expected to be material visa europe authorizes transactions for its members through its own processing system

product platform innovation 

we invest in the development and enhancement of payment product platforms with the goal of increasing the migration of consumer and business spending to electronic payments we believe that innovation results in more secure and versatile payment program options for customers merchants and consumers we focus on new payment channels card technologies payment account access devices and authentication methods and have recently made significant investments in the development of ecommerce payment platforms contact and contactless chip cards and devices card product enhancements authentication and security technologies and platforms and money transfer 

payments network management 

we devote significant resources to ensure that visa is the payments network of choice for customers merchants and cardholders we seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities increasing acceptance of visa cards around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants 

brand management and promotion 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand our integrated approach to brand management and promotion combines advertising sponsorships promotions and public relations to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand promote product usage increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention for merchants we work to ensure that the visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment as well as a way to increase sales for our customers our marketing is designed to support their card issuance activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands for cardholders we work to ensure that visa is a symbol of security convenience and acceptance 

we establish global marketing relationships to promote the visa brand and to allow customers to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events our primary global sponsorship platforms are the olympic games for which we have been the exclusive payment card sponsor since 1986 and the fifa world cup through these marketing relationships our customers may develop marketing programs that include the visa brand and mention our sponsorship status in addition we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional national and local companies sports leagues or events such as the national football league in the united states or with associations and companies to provide customized marketing platforms to customers in certain countries and regions 

  

our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments these programs which we develop in conjunction with merchants generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

we aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fastgrowing segments such as bill payment our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations delivering valueadded information services such as the visa incentive network and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment 

we enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our cards 

customer standards 

our customers are generally required to be financial institutions or other deposittaking institutions organized under local banking laws or whollyowned by such institutions certain of our customers participate in the full range of functions available to participants in the visa network such as soliciting cardholders and issuing cards soliciting and signing merchants and acquiring merchant transactions these financial institutions may also sponsor other financial institutions for more limited participation in our network 

rulemaking and enforcement 

in general our customers are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems our customers are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with and in certain cases nonequity membership interests in our subsidiaries these rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks the standards design and features of payment cards and programs merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants use of agents disputes between members risk management guaranteed settlement customer financial failures and allocation of losses among customers 

we establish dispute management procedures between customers relating to specific transactions for example after a transaction is presented to an issuer the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons including fraud if the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction the issuer may return or charge back the transaction to the acquirer we enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes 

credit risk management 

we indemnify our customers for any settlement loss suffered due to another customer’s failure to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify customers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system no material loss related to settlement risk has been incurred in recent years 

  

to manage our exposure in the event our customers fail to fund their settlement obligations we have a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures we regularly evaluate customers with significant settlement exposure to assess risk in certain instances we may require a customer to post collateral or provide other guarantees if a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss we may also apply other risk control measures such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions limiting the use of certain types of agents prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain highrisk merchants or suspending or terminating a customer’s rights to participate in our payments network the exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model key inputs to the model include the probability of customers becoming insolvent statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience and estimated settlement exposures at period end 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder or account data including systems operated by merchants financial institutions and other thirdparty data processors 

our fraud detection and prevention offerings include verified by visa a global internet authentication product which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code visa advanced authorization which adds additional fraud detection capability by adding realtime risk scores to authorization messages and chip and pin programs that have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud at physical pointofsale locations we have also implemented rules that require the use of more secure pin encryption standards for atms and pointofsale pin entry devices installed after 2002 and 2003 we have also mandated that all pins transmitted through visanet to the issuer be encrypted using the triple des or data encryption standard by july 1 2010 

interchange reimbursement fees 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system we set default interchange rates in the united states and other regions in certain jurisdictions interchange rates are subject to government regulation although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange reimbursement fees interchange reimbursement fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards we believe that interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume 

we believe the interchange rates that we use promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by eliminating the need for each of our customers to negotiate transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and ultimately consumers and merchants we believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers merchants 

  

our customers and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment and creating incentives for innovation enhanced data quality and security 

interchange reimbursement fees and related practices also have come to the attention of or have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of jurisdictions including the united states the european union australia brazil canada colombia germany honduras hungary mexico new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom in certain countries such as australia and mexico interchange rates have been adjusted in advance of or in response to government regulation we are currently devoting substantial management and financial resources to explain the importance of and defend interchange reimbursement fees and other legal and regulatory challenges we face relating to interchange reimbursement fees see item 1a—risk factors—interchange reimbursement fees and related practices are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business and item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 21—legal matters elsewhere in this report 

merchant discount rates  merchants do not pay interchange reimbursement fees a merchant’s cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate the merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in fourparty payments networks including those relating to interchange and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant customers and are established in competition with other acquirers other payment card systems and other forms of payment we do not establish or regulate merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers 

government regulation 

we are subject to government regulation of the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used our customers are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence our business is affected by such regulations for more information on government regulations that may affect our business see item 1a—risk factors 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

we own a number of valuable trademarks and designs which are essential to our business including visa interlink plus visa electron the “winged v” design the “dove” design and the “bands design—blue white  gold” we also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands products programs and services through agreements with our customers we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network 

in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters 

  

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment including paperbased forms principally cash and checks cardbased payments including credit charge debit atm prepaid privatelabel and other types of generalpurpose and limiteduse cards and other electronic payments including wire transfers electronic benefits transfers automatic clearing house or ach payments and electronic data interchange 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution customers and their cardholder merchants the leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are visa mastercard american express and diners club other generalpurpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in japan and discover in the united states in certain countries our competitors have leading positions such as china unionpay in china which is the sole domestic interbank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in china due to local regulation we also compete against privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or other merchant 

in the debit card market segment visa and mastercard are the primary global brands in addition our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by mastercard and many of the online debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands are the primary brands and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume see item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for financial information about geographic areas

working capital requirements 

payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers generally represents our most consistent and substantial liquidity requirement arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution customers with settlement currencies other than the us dollar these settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions we maintain working capital sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily settlement during fiscal 2009 we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of 117 million with the highest daily balance being 322 million

 item 1a risk factors tableend legal and regulatory risks 

interchange reimbursement fees and related practices are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers which are the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders by acquirers which are the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system we set default interchange rates in the united states and other regions in certain 

  

jurisdictions interchange rates are subject to government regulation although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange reimbursement fees interchange reimbursement fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards we believe that interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume 

as the volume of cardbased payments has increased in recent years interchange reimbursement fees including our default interchange rates have become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a similar approach to interchange reimbursement fees and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions 

interchange reimbursement fees and related practices have been the topic of recent committee hearings in the us house of representatives and the us senate as well as conferences held by a number of us federal reserve banks in 2009 legislation concerning interchange entitled the “credit card fair fee act of 2009” was introduced in the us house of representatives and referred to the house judiciary committee but no further action has been taken on the measure in 2008 a similar bill was reported out of the judiciary committee on a divided vote of 1916 but was not taken up by the full us house of representatives in its current iteration the legislation seeks to regulate interchange by allowing merchants to collectively seek to lower their interchange costs by exempting such action from the us antitrust laws the credit card fair fee act of 2009 also requires the us department of justice or doj to oversee collective merchant negotiations with the company and its customer financial institutions and separately with mastercard and its customer financial institutions and report results of those negotiations back to the us congress a companion bill has been introduced in the us senate judiciary committee but there have not been any hearings on or further movement of the legislation 

additional interchange legislation also has been introduced in the us house of representatives that would prohibit specified electronic payment system network practices including the imposition of additional charges on merchants and consumers for premium payment cards the bill also directs the federal trade commission or ftc to prescribe regulations to ensure that the rules terms and conditions to which a merchant or consumer is subject under an agreement with an electronic payment system network are neither unfair nor deceptive to consumers and merchants nor anticompetitive there has however been no further action on or developments with respect to this legislation 

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 or the credit card act which was passed by both houses of the us congress and became law commissioned a study by the comptroller general of the united states of the extent to which interchange reimbursement fees are disclosed the effect of fees and disclosure on merchants the impact on consumer prices of interchange regulation in other jurisdictions the relationship between interchange reimbursement fees and bank and merchant costs and the role of interchange in promoting competition in the provision of payment cards the resulting report was issued by the us government accountability office in november 2009 individual state legislatures in the united states are also reviewing interchange reimbursement fees and legislators in a number of states have proposed bills that purport to limit interchange reimbursement fees or merchant discount rates or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction 

in addition the merchants payments coalition a coalition of trade associations representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards is mounting a challenge to interchange reimbursement fees in the united states by seeking additional legislative and regulatory intervention interchange reimbursement fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of other jurisdictions including the european union

 regulatory actions such as these even if not directed at us or if affecting a geographic region in which we do not operate may nonetheless increase regulatory scrutiny of interchange reimbursement fees if we cannot successfully defend our ability to set default interchange rates to maximize system volume our payments system may become unattractive to issuers andor acquirers this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our openloop multiparty payments system lower overall transaction volumes andor make closedloop payments systems or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also begin to charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability acquirers could elect to charge higher merchant discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer visa cardholders to alternate payment systems in addition issuers or acquirers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking incentives from us or a reduction in the fees that we charge any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

a finding of liability in the interchange litigation may result in substantial damages 

since 2005 approximately 55 class action and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against us visa usa visa international mastercard andor other defendants including certain visa usa member financial institutions which we refer to as the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegations the plaintiffs allege that visa’s setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws the lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york the class action complaints have been consolidated into a single amended class action complaint and the individual complaints are also being consolidated in the same multidistrict litigation 

  

the plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief the plaintiffs have not yet quantified the damages they seek although several of the complaints allege that the plaintiffs expect that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and we visa usa andor visa international may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established which could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment the interchange litigation is part of the covered litigation which our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address however the retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements of or judgments in the interchange litigation failure to successfully defend or settle the interchange litigation would result in liability that to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent in addition even if our direct financial exposure were covered by our retrospective responsibility plan settlements or judgments involving the multidistrict litigation could include restrictions on our ability to conduct business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth see item 1a risk factors — our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements and judgments in the covered litigation and will not insulate us from other pending or future litigation and see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements and judgments in the covered litigation and will not insulate us from other pending or future litigation 

our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the covered litigation described in note 21— legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation including an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential followon offerings of our class a common stock or deposits of cash to the escrow account in lieu of such followon offerings a loss sharing agreement a judgment sharing agreement and the indemnification obligation of visa usa members pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique and complex and if we are prevented from using one or more of these mechanisms under our retrospective responsibility plan we could have difficulty funding the payment of a settlement or final judgment against us in a covered litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

the retrospective responsibility plan does not address litigation other than the covered litigation that we currently face including state court litigation relating to interchange and will not cover litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation in addition our retrospective responsibility plan is designed to cover only the potential monetary liability from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation settlements and judgments in covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business in the future which could adversely affect our revenues increase our expenses andor limit our prospects for growth therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan adequately safeguards us from the monetary impact of settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation it may not be sufficient to insulate us from all potential adverse consequences of settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation 

  

if the settlements of visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion cases do not become final and we are unsuccessful in any of the various lawsuits relating to visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

visa usa and visa international are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that their currency conversion practices are or were deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful 

on july 20 2006 and september 14 2006 visa usa and visa international entered into agreements to settle or otherwise dispose of these matters pursuant to the settlement agreements visa usa paid approximately 100 million as part of the defendants’ settlement fund for the federal actions and approximately 19 million to fund settlement of the state cases while the federal court has granted final approval of the settlement agreements the settlements are subject to resolution of any appeals if an appeal is filed and we are unsuccessful in that appellate proceeding all of the agreements resolving the federal and state actions will terminate if that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against some or all of these lawsuits we may have to pay restitution andor damages and may be required to modify our currency conversion practices the potential amount of damages andor restitution could be substantial in addition although visa usa and visa international have substantially changed the practices that were at issue in these litigations if the courts require further changes to our currency conversion and crossborder transaction practices it could materially and adversely affect our business see note 21 — legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

if we visa usa or visa international is found liable in certain other lawsuits that have been brought against us or if we are found liable in other litigation to which we may become subject in the future we may be forced to pay substantial damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

in recent years numerous civil actions and investigations have been filed or initiated against visa alleging or seeking information as to alleged violations of competitionantitrust consumer protection intellectual property and other laws these actions and investigations have been filed or initiated by a variety of different parties including the doj us state attorneys general merchants and consumers examples of such claims are described more fully in note 21 — legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

in addition in the united states private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers due to the size and scope of our business and the large number of parties involved in our payment system 

we have also received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies suggesting that we may be infringing a preexisting patent or that we need to license use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us 

we cannot predict whether or to what extent we will be subject to liability arising from these or other actions nor can we predict how much of this liability would not be covered by our retrospective responsibility plan if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future proceedings we may be forced to pay substantial damages limit the fees we charge or change other business practices limiting our payments volume resulting in a material and adverse effect on our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

  

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years as a result of litigation and litigation settlements for example as a result of the june 2003 settlement of a us merchant lawsuit against visa usa merchants are able to reject visa consumer debit cards in the united states while still accepting other visabranded cards and vice versa in addition following the final judgment entered in the litigation the doj brought against visa usa and visa international in 1998 as of october 2004 members of visa usa may issue certain competing payment cards since this final judgment several members of visa usa have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

these and any future limitations on our business resulting from settlements of or judgments in pending or potential litigation could limit the fees we charge and reduce our payments volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

tax audits or disputes or changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable many factors may decrease their accuracy we are currently under audit by the irs and other tax authorities and may be subject to additional audits in the future the tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability in addition changes in existing laws such as recent proposals for fundamental us and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate a substantial increase in our tax burden could have an adverse effect on our financial results see also note 20 — income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 in this report 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our customers and us and may lead to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues 

regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years examples of such regulation include 

 

  

  

   

  

 increased regulatory focus in connection with these matters may increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause a reduction in payments volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and our revenues 

recently there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states at the federal and state level and elsewhere on privacy and data use and security including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach these measures may materially increase our costs and our customers’ costs and may decrease the number of our cards that our customers issue materially and adversely affecting our profitability our failure or the failure of our customers to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brand 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card and processing providers in order to support them or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in their countries our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

if government regulators determine that we are a systemically important payments system we may have to change our settlement procedures or other operations which could make it more costly to operate our business and reduce our operational flexibility 

a number of international initiatives are underway to maintain financial stability by strengthening financial infrastructure the committee on payment and settlement systems of the central banks of the group of ten countries has developed a set of core principles for “systemically important payment systems” government regulators in the united states or elsewhere may determine that we are a “systemically important payments system” and impose settlement risk management requirements on us including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system any of these developments could make it more costly to operate our business 

  

our framework agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities 

under our framework agreement with visa europe we are required to indemnify visa europe for losses resulting from any claims in the united states or anywhere else outside of visa europe’s region arising from our or their activities that relate to our payments business or the payments business of visa europe this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related parties or agents participated in the actions that gave rise to such claims such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liabilities 

business risks 

we face intense competitive pressure on customer pricing which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

in order to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand our card base we offer incentives to customers such as upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased growth incentives marketing support payments and other support such as marketing consulting and market research studies over the past several years we have increased our use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives such pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and profitability if we continue to increase incentives to our customers we will need to further increase payments volume or the amount of services we provide in order to benefit incrementally from such arrangements and to increase revenues and profit and we may not be successful in doing so in addition we enter into longterm contracts with certain customers continued pressure on fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on terms we consider favorable and may require us to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships increased pricing pressure also enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives and we may not succeed in these efforts 

our operating results may suffer because of intense competition in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is intensely competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automatic clearing house payments in addition our payment programs compete against the card based payments systems of our competitors such as mastercard american express discover and privatelabel cards issued by merchants some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have or may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements our competitors may also introduce more innovative programs and services than us 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without involving intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models in addition these competitors have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of openloop multiparty payments systems such as ours 

  

our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services most of our larger customer relationships including those with our largest customers jpmorgan chase and bank of america are not exclusive and in certain circumstances including in some cases on relatively short notice may be terminated by our customers because a significant portion of our operating revenues are concentrated among our largest customers our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of our largest customers for any reason which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we also expect that there may be changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 

  

  

  

 our failure to compete effectively against any of these threats could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

consolidation of the banking industry could result in our losing business and may create pressure on the fees we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

the banking industry has recently undergone substantial accelerated consolidation which is likely to continue significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in one or more of our largest customers being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our customers and potential customers and could increase the bargaining power of our remaining customers and potential customers this consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us in addition consolidation could prompt our existing customers to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our financial institution customers absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volumebased discounts on the combined volumes of the merged businesses pressure on the fees we charge our customers caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business in addition the current economic environment could lead some customers to curtail or postpone nearterm investments in growing their card portfolios limit credit lines or take other actions that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these customers 

  

merchants are pursuing litigation and supporting regulatory proceedings relating to the costs associated with payment card acceptance and are negotiating incentive arrangements including pricing discounts all of which may increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our customers to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants that are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry the emphasis merchants are placing on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may lead to additional regulation and litigation which would not be covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and which could impair our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we along with our customers negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance of our payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate our customers and we may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow faster than the financial institutions that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

failure to maintain relationships with our customers and other third parties and failure of customers to provide services on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business 

we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationships with our customers and their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not generally solicit merchants to accept our cards and we do not establish the discount rates merchants are charged for card acceptance which are the responsibility of acquirers as a result the success of our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our customers and the strength of our relationships with them 

in many countries outside of the united states our customers or other processors authorize clear and settle most domestic as opposed to crossborder transactions using our payment cards without involving our processing systems we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving our cards because we do not provide domestic transaction processing services in these countries do not generally have direct relationships with merchants and never have direct relationships with cardholders our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in these countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brand 

in addition we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf and to the extent that thirdparty vendors fail to deliver services our business and reputation could be impaired 

  

our perception in the marketplace may affect our brands and reputation which are key assets of our business 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to visabranded products depends highly upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that change the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” which may materially and adversely affect our business further visa europe has very broad latitude to operate the visa business in and use our brands and technology within visa europe’s region and we have only limited control over the operation of the visa business there visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the visa brand in its region and the strength of the visa global brand is contingent in part on the efforts of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe finally adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny 

global economic political health and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending and crossborder travel which may materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending the current economic environment could lead some customers to curtail or postpone nearterm investments in growing their card portfolios limit credit lines or take other actions that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these customers a significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the united states results from crossborder business and leisure travel in particular revenues from processing foreign currency transactions fluctuate with crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu such as h1n1 and avian flu viruses such as sars and other diseases 

in addition as we are principally domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states could harm the perception of our company which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we are exposed to a risk of loss or insolvency if our customers fail to fund settlement obligations we have guaranteed 

we indemnify visa customers for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of a customer to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we may indemnify customers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of the indemnification are unlimited 

concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest customers or of several of our smaller customers or systemic operational failures that last for more than a singleday may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the amount of such payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

  

settlement at risk or exposure is estimated based on the sum of the following inputs 1 average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle plus a safety margin and 2 four months of rolling average chargebacks volume and 3 the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques see note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

some visa customers are composed of groups of financial institutions some of these customers have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we cannot process transactions efficiently the perception of our brands and our revenues or operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism or accident our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks leading to an interruption in service increased costs or the compromise of data security additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in the payments industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which could reduce our revenues and income 

the payments industry is subject to rapid significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards ecommerce and mobile commerce we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes or by third parties’ intellectual property our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenues 

we our customers merchants and other third parties store cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards in addition our customers may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems on which 

  

sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our cards reputational damage and claims against us if we are sued in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our customers merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our costs 

an increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards if fraud levels involving our cards were to rise it could lead to reputational damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs 

failure to maintain interoperability between visa inc’s and visa europe’s authorization and clearing and settlement systems could damage the business and global perception of the visa brand 

with the completion of the deployment of visa europe’s own authorization and clearing and settlement systems expected in fiscal 2010 it is incumbent upon both service providers visa inc and visa europe to ensure their systems can process every transaction regardless of where it originates the increasingly independent payments system operations of visa europe could present challenges to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective systems as they diverge over time failure to authorize or clear and settle transactions in a timely and accurate manner could impair the global perception of the visa brand 

material changes in our customers’ performance compared to our estimates could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations 

in certain instances we offer our customers financial incentives which are typically tied to their payments volume or transaction messages processed often under particular programs these financial incentives are typically recorded as a reduction of revenues we generally make estimates of our customers’ performance under these programs sometimes over several years in order to derive our estimates of the financial incentives that we will pay them the reduction of revenues that we record each quarter under volume and support agreements is based on these estimates material differences between our customers’ performance and our estimates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for example if a customer performs better than expected we may be required to reduce future period revenues to account for the fact that we did not reduce revenues enough in prior periods on the other hand if a customer performs worse than expected we may conclude that we reduced revenues by too much in previous period 

  

risks related to our structure and organization 

we have a limited ability to control visa europe’s operations and limited recourse in the event of a breach of its obligations to us 

our relationship with visa europe is governed by a framework agreement which gives visa europe very broad rights to operate the visa business in its region since our reorganization visa europe has not been subject to the same global operating rules as our subsidiaries and customers if we want to change a global rule or require visa europe to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for visa europe and its members then visa europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that visa europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation our remedies under this agreement if visa europe fails to meet its obligations are limited we cannot terminate the framework agreement even upon visa europe’s material uncured breach and we can exercise our call right to purchase visa europe under only extremely limited circumstances 

these and other features of the licenses granted under the framework agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of tax treatment of entry into the licenses and payments received thereunder any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we are able to provide could negatively affect cardholders from visa europe using cards in our regions or our cardholders using cards in visa europe’s region 

if visa europe makes us acquire all of its outstanding stock we will incur substantial costs and may suffer a material and adverse effect on our operations and net income 

we have granted visa europe a put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of visa europe’s outstanding capital stock from its members we will incur a substantial financial obligation if visa europe exercises the put option which it may do at any time we cannot estimate the amount of this obligation due to the nature and number of factors involved and the range of important assumptions that would be required but it could be several billion dollars or more we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or by undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to meet our obligation sufficient financing may not be available to us on reasonable terms within the 285 days we would have to pay the exercise price an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders see note 3—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements include in item 8 of this report 

if visa europe exercises the put option we may encounter difficulties in integrating visa europe’s business and systems into our existing operations if we cannot do so quickly and costeffectively the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management disrupt our current operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

we are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option these adjustments will be recorded through our consolidated statements of operations which will therefore affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these charges could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the price at which we can raise it see note 3—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements include in item 8 of this report 

we depend on key employees and may be unable to retain them 

our employees are vital to our success and our key management and other employees are difficult to replace we may not be able to retain highly qualified employees in the future which could adversely affect our business 

  

any acquisitions or strategic investments that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may make strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses products or technologies although we have entered into relatively few such transactions in the past we may not be able to successfully finance partner with or integrate any such businesses products or technologies furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues our cash reserves would be reduced to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash if we pay the purchase price with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of and investments in businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions and investments 

future sales of our class a common stock or convertible securities or the expiration or waiver of transfer restrictions on our class b and class c common stock could result in dilution to our existing class a common stock holders which may adversely affect their rights and depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock and the voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock could decline because of increases in the number of such shares outstanding the market price of our class a common stock may also be adversely affected by the perception that such an increase could occur such as upon the issuance or conversion of securities convertible to shares of our class a common stock 

if funds are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan holders of our class a common stock will suffer dilution because of a favorable adjustment to the conversion rate of our class b common stock 

our retrospective responsibility plan provides that any amounts remaining in the escrow account after the date on which all of the covered litigation is resolved will be released back to us and that the conversion rate of the class b common stock then outstanding will be adjusted in favor of the holders of the class b common stock the adjustment would be through a formula based on the released escrow amount and the market price of our class a common stock if any funds remain in the escrow account and are released back to us the resulting adjustment in the conversion rate of the class b common stock will result in each share of class b common stock then outstanding becoming convertible into an increased number of shares of class a common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest in visa inc held by the holders of class a common stock the amount of this dilution will depend on the amount if any of the funds released from the escrow account and the market price of our class a common stock at the time those funds are released 

all shares of class a common stock acquired by a visa member an affiliate of a visa member or a similar person will be converted automatically into class c common stock and as a result will generally not be transferable until march 25 2011 and they will lose substantially all their voting rights 

all shares of common stock acquired by a visa member an affiliate of a visa member or any person that is a competitor or its affiliate in each case to the extent acting as a principal investor will be converted automatically into class c common stock under the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation class c common stock is generally not transferable until march 25 2011 after this date has passed the class c common stock will be convertible into class a common stock only if transferred to a person that was not immediately after our reorganization a visa member an 

  

affiliate of a visa member or a competitor or its affiliate upon such transfer each share of class c common stock will convert into one share of class a common stock 

holders of our class b and class c common stock have voting rights concerning certain significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of holders of our class a common stock 

although holders of our class b and class c common stock do not have any right to vote on those matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote such as the election of directors such holders do have the right to vote on certain significant transactions such as a proposed consolidation or merger a decision to exit our core payments business or any other vote required by law the holders of the class b and class c common stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the holders of class a common stock and their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable for instance except for limited exceptions no person may beneficially own more than 15 of our class a common stock or 15 of our total outstanding shares on an asconverted basis unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance in addition except for common stock issued to a member in connection with our reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock shares held by a competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may not exceed 5 of our total outstanding shares on an asconverted basis 

our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

in august 2008 we commenced quarterly payment of cash dividends on our class a class b and class c common stock any future payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant if because of these factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make payments of dividends of our common stock furthermore no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class and series of common stock

overview 

visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers businesses banks and governments around the world enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash we provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit debit prepaid and commercial payments we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions merchants consumers businesses and government entities each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic forms of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position visa to serve more and different constituencies 

in order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance visa’s ability to compete we consummated a reorganization in october 2007 and in march 2008 completed our ipo the global alignment of various functions and best practices provides us the business scale to effectively deliver our existing core products across more and different geographies and to accelerate the delivery of product innovations across different market segments 

overall economic conditions 

our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending we expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending and our rate of payments volume growth in the near term regulatory measures enacted in the united states during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 expected to take effect in fiscal 2010 will impact our financial institution customers should financial institutions constrict credit offerings in response to these measures this could ultimately impact consumer spending and our payments volumes however we believe that the continuing secular shift to electronic payment products for nondiscretionary spending will buffer the impact to our overall payments volume growth this shift is particularly clear in debit products where visa has a strong market position in the united states and significant growth opportunities internationally 

funding of the litigation escrow account 

during december 2008 and july 2009 we deposited 11 billion and 07 billion respectively into the litigation escrow account the “escrow account” previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan the “plan” under the terms of the plan when visa funds the escrow account the shares of class b common stock retained by our us financial institution customers and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock on that basis fundings of the escrow account in december 2008 and july 2009 had the effect of repurchasing 20800824 and 11578878 class a common stock equivalents respectively see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements 

  

share repurchase plan 

in october 2009 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase plan the authorization will be in place through september 30 2010 and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors see the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion 

sale of investment in companhia brasileira de meois de pagamento “visanet do brasil” 

in june 2009 visa international service association a whollyowned subsidiary of the company sold its 10 ownership interest in visanet do brasil in connection with its initial public offering as a result of this transaction we received approximately 1 billion in net proceeds and recognized a pretax gain of 473 million in investment income net on our statement of operations the amount of the gain net of tax was 237 million following their initial public offering we amended an existing agreement with visanet do brasil which grants a license to use visa trademarks and technology intellectual property we expect the license fees to be earned during fiscal 2010 to offset the loss of dividend income as a result of the sale of our ownership interest 

expansion of our processing capabilities 

expanding our processing capabilities worldwide is a core component of our longterm growth strategy as part of this strategy we created visa processing services pte ltd “vps” a joint venture with yalamanchili international pte ltd “yalamanchili” we hold a 70 interest in vps yalamanchili is a payments processor and software company with operations in asia vps will allow us to extend our industryleading processing capabilities in geographies where electronic payments are growing rapidly providing multicurrency and multilanguage debit credit and prepaid processing services to financial institutions processors and payment companies vps will also have capabilities to provide atm money transfer and private label processing as well as a range of payments services including risk and fraud management mobile applications loyalty and cardholder support vps provides prepaid and debit processing solutions and complements our debit processing service 

nominal payments volume and transaction counts 

we believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues as anticipated for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year over year nominal payments volume impact 

  

this table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars 1  

 

  

    this table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our visanet system during the following fiscal periods 

 

   

results of operations 

operating revenues 

our operating revenues are primarily generated from payment volume on visabranded cards for goods and services as well as the number size and type of transactions processed on our visanet system we do not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest and fees paid by cardholders on visabranded cards our issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders and most other competitive card features we do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance including the merchant discount rate our acquiring customers which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants establish and earn these fees 

the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues 

service revenues are earned from customers for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the visa brand service revenues are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume 

data processing revenues are earned for authorization clearing settlement transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our customers globally and visa europe data processing revenues are based on information we accumulate from visanet our secure centralized global processing platform which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers 

international transaction revenues are assessed to customers on transactions where the cardholder’s issuer country is different from the merchant’s country international transaction revenues are generally driven by crossborder payments volume which includes single currency transactions and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency 

other revenues consist primarily of optional service or product enhancements such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services cardholder services and fees for licensing and certification other revenues also include revenues earned from visa europe in connection with the visa europe framework agreement 

volume and support incentives represent contracts with financial institution customers merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance these incentives are accounted for as reductions of operating revenues 

operating expenses 

personnel includes salaries stockbased compensation incentives and various fringe benefits 

network edp and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network including maintenance equipment rental and fees for other data processing services 

advertising marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the visa brand 

visa international fees represents fees that visa usa paid to visa international prior to our reorganization for services primarily related to global brand management global product enhancements management of global system development and interoperability and corporate support to the entire visa enterprise these fees ceased as a result of our reorganization 

  

professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting contractors legal and other professional services 

depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our reorganization 

administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business 

litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile the specifics of the case advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates 

other income expense 

interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt 

investment income net represents returns on our fixedincome securities and other investments investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost and equity method investments 

other nonoperating income primarily relates to the change in fair value of the liability under the framework agreement with visa europe this liability was fully discharged in october 2008 

visa inc fiscal 2009 and 2008 and visa usa fiscal 2007 

the following discussion of results of operations compares visa inc consolidated results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 and visa usa results for fiscal 2007 visa usa was the accounting acquirer in the reorganization that took place on october 1 2007 and therefore visa usa results are considered the historical predecessor for those of visa inc and are included for comparison 

operating revenues 

the following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the us throughout the rest of the world and from visa europe operating revenues for periods prior to october 1 2007 are for visa usa and are not presented in the table below revenues earned from visa europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with visa europe 

 

  

   

operating revenues globally reflect the impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model us revenues also reflect volume and support incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts we regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers 

a significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the united states results from crossborder business and leisure travel which has moderated in the current economic environment revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with crossborder travel and the extent to which visabranded products are utilized for travel purposes 

our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volumes are denominated the strengthening of the us dollar in fiscal 2009 over the prior year resulted in a 3 decline in total operating revenues including the impact from our hedging activities the decline primarily impacted service and international transaction revenues 

the following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues 

 

  

 revenue growth in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects a moderate increase in nominal payments volume solid growth of processed transactions and strategic pricing modifications operating revenues increased during fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 primarily due to the inclusion of operating revenues from acquired regions double digit growth in nominal payments volume processed transactions and crossborder nominal payments volume combined with competitive pricing adjustments the discussion below comparing fiscal 2008 and 2007 focuses on factors other than the inclusion of 24 billion of the acquired regions’ operating revenues in fiscal 2008 

 

  

   

  

  

 the net asset liability of volume and support incentives changed during the year as follows 

 

  

     

operating expenses 

the following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented 

 

  

 operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009 driven by the absence of the litigation provision in connection with our discover settlement in fiscal 2008 coupled with lower costs in personnel marketing and professional fees operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 fiscal 2008 and 2007 comparisons below focus on factors other than the inclusion of acquired regions’ operating expenses in fiscal 2008 which totaled 13 billion this increase was substantially offset by a decrease in litigation provision of 12 billion 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 other income expense 

the following table sets forth the components of our other income expense for the periods presented 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 effective income tax rate 

the effective tax rate increased to 41 in fiscal 2009 compared with 40 in fiscal 2008 and 23 for visa usa in fiscal 2007 the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in visanet do brasil which increased the overall effective tax rate by approximately 1 our singapore subsidiary began operating under a tax incentive agreement in fiscal 2009 which had an insignificant impact on the fiscal 2009 effective tax rate the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to tax reserves related to litigation and the combined effect of the loss of certain special deductions in california for which we were eligible prior to our ipo the change in state tax apportionment and a onetime benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 to decrease to below 40 due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income 

liquidity and capital resources 

management of our liquidity 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives 

the objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios to ensure payment of required litigation settlement payments to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities to make planned capital investments in our business to pay dividends to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are highquality and marketable in the short term 

based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months management will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances 

cash flow data 

this table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years 

 

   

 

 operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income of 24 billion and adjustments for noncash items of 15 billion standard noncash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a 473 million book gain on the sale of our investment in visanet do brasil which is reflected in investing activities cash from operating activities also reflects the use of 33 billion to fund significant operational payments including litigation and volume and support incentives 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income of 804 million and adjustments for noncash items of 31 billion cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations reflecting the use of 92 million to satisfy payments settlement activities 115 million of compensation benefit payments net of new accruals and 217 million of volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals these uses of cash were offset by deferred taxes payable depreciation and amortization and other noncash items as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities 

investing activities cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects 884 million of cash distribution from the reserve primary fund the “fund” net cash proceeds of 290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and 10 billion from the sale of our 10 ownership in visanet do brasil all of which were reinvested in money market funds we also purchased 306 million of property equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center 

cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008 reflects 1002 million of cash acquired through the reorganization 949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were reinvested in shorterterm cash equivalents and 415 million of property equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center in addition we reclassified our 953 million investment in the fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet see further discussion under sources of liquidity below and note 6—prepaid expenses and other assets to our consolidated financial statements 

financing activities cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractuallyrequired redemption of our class c series ii and class c series iii common shares for 26 billion funding of 18 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of 318 million offset by funding of covered litigation payments totaling 20 billion from the litigation escrow account 

cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributed to ipo related activities including 191 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class a common stock offset by 134 billion used for the partial redemption of class b and class c series i common stock and 30 billion payment to the litigation escrow account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements in addition there was a source of cash of 11 billion reflecting funding of covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account offset by 93 million and 22 million for dividend and routine debt payments respectively 

sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash flow from our operations an investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investment securities or long 

  

term availableforsale investment securities based upon our funding requirements access to liquidity from these holdings and return that these holdings provide 

investment portfolio our investment portfolio primarily comprises of securities which enable us to meet a desired level of liquidity to meet working capital needs our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities including money market funds debt securities issued by us governmentsponsored agencies and canadian government debt securities the liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict uncertainties in the credit markets have affected a number of these holdings 

in september 2008 the fund was unable to honor our request for the full redemption of our investment totaling 983 million the fund was subsequently placed into liquidation and announced that it would distribute funds to investors on a prorata basis in proportion to the number of shares held by each investor since the announcement we have received distributions totaling 903 million including 19 million received in october of fiscal 2010 we believe that the fund will distribute its remaining assets within twelve months and have therefore classified our remaining investment of 69 million which reflects an impairment of 29 million as a current asset at september 30 2009 see note 6—prepaid expenses and other assets to our consolidated financial statements 

other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities rates of default of the underlying assets underlying collateral value discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions however if current market conditions deteriorate the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired which could adversely impact our financial results we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 

revolving credit facilities on february 15 2008 we entered into a 30 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain of our class b and class c stockholders and certain of our customers and affiliates of our customers loans under the fiveyear facility may be in the form of 1 base rate advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus 05 or the bank of america prime rate 2 eurocurrency advance which will bear interest at a rate equal to libor as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 011 to 030 based on our credit rating or 3 us swing loan euro swing loan or foreign currency swing loan which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable swing loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for euro and sterling loans an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment we also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount whether used or unused at a rate ranging from 004 to 010 and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 005 to 010 based on our credit rating currently the applicable margin is 015 the facility fee is 005 and the utilization fee is 005 this facility contains certain covenants including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to ebitda and events of default customary for financings of this type this facility expires on february 15 2013 there have been no borrowings under this facility at september 30 2009 we were in compliance with all covenants with respect to this facility 

us commercial paper programs  we maintain a 500 million us commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings the commercial paper program is a source of shortterm borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover shortterm cash needs at september 30 2009 we had no obligations outstanding under this program there are no financial covenants related to this program 

  

universal shelf registration statement on may 6 2009 we filed a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission using a shelf registration process per the registration statement we may from time to time sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions the registration statement expires on may 5 2012 

escrow account we maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters when the company funds the escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our shareholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements the balance in this account at september 30 2009 was 17 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 14 billion in current assets and 350 million in longterm assets as these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters we have not included them as part of our liquid assets however they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters as described below under uses of liquidity 

credit ratings 

at september 30 2009 standard and poor’s and moody’s rated our unsecured debt as follows 

 

 various factors affect our credit ratings including changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the electronic payment industry our financial position and changes in our business strategy we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded if a downgrade were to occur it could adversely impact among other things our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

uses of liquidity 

payments settlement payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers represents our most consistent liquidity requirement arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the us dollar us dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance these settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions we maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement typically the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in december and early january during the holiday shopping season 

covered litigation we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation as part of the plan we deposited 30 billion of our ipo proceeds into an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in covered litigation will be paid during fiscal 2009 we deposited an additional 18 billion into the escrow account under the plan when the company funds the escrow account the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to the shares of class a common stock see note 4—retrospective responsibility plan and note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial 

  

statements in fiscal 2009 we made 20 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account 

other litigation judgments in and settlements of litigation other than covered litigation could give rise to future liquidity needs for example in connection with our retailers’ litigation settlement in fiscal 2003 we were required to make annual settlement payments of 200 million through fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2009 we entered into an agreement the “prepayment agreement” to modify our remaining payment obligations under the original retailers’ litigation settlement agreement pursuant to the prepayment agreement on october 5 2009 we made a payment of 682 million to fully satisfy the remaining 800 million obligation 

redemption of stock in fiscal 2008 we redeemed 154738487 shares of class b common stock for 66 billion and 159657751 shares of our class c series i common stock for 68 billion in fiscal 2009 we completed the redemption of 79748857 shares of our class c series ii common stock and 35263585 shares of our class c series iii common stock held by visa europe for 26 billion less dividends and certain other adjustments in october 2009 our board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase plan the authorization will be in place through september 30 2010 and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors 

dividends  during fiscal 2009 we paid 318 million in dividends on october 20 2009 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of 0125 per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an asconverted basis we expect to pay approximately 93 million in connection with this dividend in december 2009 see note 15—stockholders’ equity to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the dividend declarations we intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash subject to approval by our board of directors at an annual rate equal to 050 per share of class a common stock class b and class c common stock will share ratably on an asconverted basis in such future dividends 

visa europe put option we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time the purchase price of the visa europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that subject to certain adjustments applies visa inc’s forward pricetoearnings multiple the “pe ratio” at the time the option is exercised as defined in the option agreement to visa europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12month period “adjusted sustainable income” visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income is calculated under the terms of the put option agreement and includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 

at september 30 2009 the fair value of the put option liability was 346 million while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2009 it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollars or more we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things visa europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our pe ratio in each case as determined at the time the put option is exercised 

given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purposes only a range of pe ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates 75 million of adjusted 

  

sustainable income at the date of exercise the 75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below for illustrative purposes only is based on visa europe’s financial results for the year ended september 30 2008 however this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september 30 2008 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated pe ratios for each 25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed 75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september 30 2009 our estimated longterm pe ratio was 220 and the pe differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe was 45x as compared to the estimated long term differential of 53x we used to value the put option however these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were to be exercised at any point in the future 

 

  

 pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service age and employees’ final three to five years of earnings as well as a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act or erisa our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan in fiscal 2009 2008 and for visa usa in fiscal 2007 we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of 170 million 190 million and 65 million respectively in fiscal 2010 we intend to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately 70 million 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2009 we completed the construction of a new data center on the east coast of the united states upon completion in march 2009 we migrated our current east coast data center to this new facility the new data center is intended to support our technology objectives related to reliability scalability security and new product development in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 we incurred total costs of 156 million 241 million and 23 million respectively related to the construction of this new data center we will continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure some of which we treat as capital expenditures 

other uses in addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness our total outstanding principal balance of debt at september 30 2009 net of unamortized issuance costs was 56 million 

  

fair value measurements—financial instruments 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on the provisions of accounting standards codification “asc” 820 asc 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability 

as of september 30 2009 our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately 63 billion of assets of which 34 million or less than 1 had significant unobservable inputs for these instruments we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes marketable debt instruments in this category include corporate debt securities mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities and auction rate securities see note 5—investments and fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements are comprised of guarantees visa has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 

guarantees and indemnifications 

in 2001 visa international entered into a 20year lease agreement for premises in london to be occupied by the eu region and visa cemea the lease is assigned to visa europe services inc or vesi a whollyowned subsidiary of visa europe with visa international acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the united kingdom in the event of a default by vesi visa international is obligated to make base lease payments vesi has agreed to reimburse visa international for any liabilities that may arise under visa international’s guarantee to the landlord visa international has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than 1 million at september 30 2009 

we indemnify customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor visa cards traveler’s cheques or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations the amount of the indemnification is unlimited we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require customers to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies and note 12—settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other customers under which we may agree to indemnify the customer for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement historically payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial 

contractual obligations 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and offbalance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at september 30 2009 we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and 

  

available credit facilities see note 3—visa europe note 10—debt note 18—commitments and contingencies  and note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

         

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 

revenue recognition—volume and support incentives 

critical estimates we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution customers merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance these incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance other incentives are based on fixed payments and are generally deferred if certain criteria are met the deferability criteria includes the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability 

assumptions and judgment estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume estimates of card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our systems historical information and discussions with our customers 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if our customers’ actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume and as a result in the event incentive payments exceed estimates such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable for the year ended september 30 2009 performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1 of our total operating revenues 

fair value—visa europe put option 

critical estimates we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option under which we are required to purchase all of the share capital of visa europe from its members at any time the purchase price of the visa europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that subject to certain adjustments applies visa inc’s forward pricetoearnings multiple as defined in the agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12month period see note 3—visa europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 

the fair value of visa europe’s option which under certain conditions could obligate us to purchase its members’ equity interests for an amount greater than fair value was determined to be 

  

approximately 346 million at september 30 2009 while the put option is in fact non transferable this 

amount recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction our valuation methodology involves using probability weighted models designed to estimate the present value of our liability assuming various possible exercise decisions that visa europe could make including the possibility it will never exercise its option under different economic conditions in the future while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september 30 2009 it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollars or more see the liquidity and capital resources section of management’s discussion and analysis for further discussion 

assumptions and judgment the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to as the pe differential 

probability of exercise —exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under its articles of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to i visa europe’s stated intentions ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results iii evaluation of market conditions including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europe’s largest members which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

pe differential —the pe differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward pricetoearnings multiples applicable to our common stock as defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purposes the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors quantitatively we estimate our pe ratio by dividing the average stock price over both the shorter of the preceding 24 months or since our ipo the “longterm pe calculation” and the last 30 trading dates the “30day pe calculation” prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers’ estimate system ibes we then determine the best estimate of our long term pricetoearnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30day pe calculation as compared to the longterm pe calculation in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences if any are the result of a fundamental change in longterm value of the company or the result of shortterm market volatility or other noncompany specific market factors that may not be indicative of our longterm forward pe we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that a market participant would more heavily weight longterm value indicators as opposed to shortterm indicators 

factors that might indicate a fundamental change in longterm value include but are not limited to changes in the regulatory environment client portfolio longterm growth rates or new product innovation a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market’s expectations of the future earnings of visa inc and the comparable companies 

other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income 

  

the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europe’s current business model as an association owned by its member banks while the highest reflect a successful shift to a forprofit model in anticipation of exercise the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that should it choose to exercise its option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a forprofit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe’s results from euros to us dollars reflects our estimate of longterm exchange rates and is determined based on forward foreign exchange rates available in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2009 we have assumed a 40 probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 53x the use of a probability of exercise that is 5 higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 44 million in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 71 million in the value of the put option the put option became exercisable during fiscal 2009 the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe as such the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2009 classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management’s expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months 

fair value—goodwill and intangible assets 

critical estimates we are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill we are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment 

assumptions and judgment judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations including goodwill and intangible assets can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management we believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors including the competitive environment market share customer history and macroeconomic situation we determined that our brand and customer relationships intangible assets have indefinite lives based on our significant market share history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and historical retention rates our assets acquired liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to one reporting unit which is the level in which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker 

review of impairment is completed annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist impairment testing for intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or asset group and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or asset group impairment exists if the fair value is less than the carrying value goodwill impairment is reviewed using a twostep process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that 

  

goodwill management relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows business plans and use of present value techniques no impairment of our intangible assets or goodwill exists as of our july 1 2009 annual assessment and no events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization among other factors 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates we may be exposed to impairment charges the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets was 211 billion including 109 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets at september 30 2009 

legal and regulatory matters 

critical estimates we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statements 

assumptions and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding to which we are a party we record a liability for claims and legal proceedings when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 

our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes which could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

income taxes 

critical estimates in calculating our effective tax rate we make judgments regarding certain tax positions including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 

assumptions and judgment we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only partially be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

impact if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable actual results may differ from these estimates some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the american express litigation and the discover litigation and other matters see note 21—legal matters to our consolidated financial statements if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 

  

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended fasb asc 26010 to address whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the twoclass method  the amendment requires companies to treat unvested sharebased payment awards that have nonforfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share we will adopt this amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 this change will not result in any impact to fiscal 2009 and 2008 full year diluted class a net income per share 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency rates interest rates and equity prices we do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are related primarily to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues that are derived from foreign currencydenominated transactions and to adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies primarily for costs and expenses at our nonus locations we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedges exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated nonus dollar denominated cash flows our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but does not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 

in fiscal 2009 we implemented a rolling hedge strategy program which we anticipate utilizing going forward under this strategy we seek to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was 742 million and 4 million respectively at september 30 2009 and september 30 2008 the aggregate notional amount of 742 million outstanding at september 30 2009 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold however actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast the effect of a hypothetical 10 change of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of 61 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september 30 2009 see note 13 — derivative financial instruments 

we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with customers relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

  

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixedrate and adjustablerate securities these assets are included in cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm availableforsale investments investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates additionally a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate generating less interest income historically we have been able to hold investments until maturity operating results or cash flows have not been and are not expected to be materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates the fair value balances of our fixedrate investment securities in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were 176 million and 403 million respectively 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately 3 million at september 30 2009 

the fair value balances of our adjustablerate debt securities were 34 million and 103 million at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates would have impacted the fair value of these notes by approximately 2 million at september 30 2009 

visa europe put option 

we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair market value at september 30 2009 we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september 30 2009 we have assumed a 40 probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a pe differential at the time of exercise of approximately 53x the use of a probability of exercise 5 higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately 44 million in the value of the put option an increase of 10x in the assumed pe differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately 71 million in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 

pension plan assets risk 

our total defined benefit pension plan assets were 703 million and 624 million at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively although these assets are not included in our financial statements a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets could result in increases to our pension liability and a reduction to stockholders’ equity due to an increase in the underfunded status of the plan increases in pension expense due to a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets and increases in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2010 which we expect to make in september 2010

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

this management’s discussion and analysis covers fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 and provides a review of the results of operations financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of visa usa inc and its subsidiaries and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings as well as those factors that may affect future earnings the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 

prior to the closing of the global reorganization in october 2007 visa usa along with visa international comprising the operating regions of ap lac and cemea visa canada and visa europe operated as one of five entities related by ownership and membership to visa after the reorganization visa usa visa international and visa canada became subsidiaries of visa inc a delaware stock corporation 

visa usa is a leader in the electronic payments industry in the united states and is responsible for administering visa payment programs in the united states visa usa provides products and services over a secure payments network to support payment programs offered by its member financial institutions to their consumer commercial and merchant customers visa usa’s principal product platforms include consumer credit consumer debit and cash access prepaid and commercial programs visa usa’s primary customers are its member financial institutions participating in the payments network prior to the reorganization visa usa was a regional group member of visa international and operated as a nonstock corporation with approximately 13300 member financial institutions 

visa usa achieved 22 growth in operating revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 this growth reflects a 10 increase in payments volume as defined below on visa usa’s products for the fiscal year with doubledigit payments volume growth in commercial and consumer debit products and an 11 increase in the number of transactions payments volume which is the basis for service fees and transactions which drive data processing fees are key drivers for visa usa’s business payments volume is defined as the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with visa products including pinbased debit volume and excluding cash disbursements obtained with visabranded cards balance transfers and convenience checks which visa usa refers to as cash volume 

operating revenues increased at a higher rate than underlying payments volume growth primarily due to two new acceptance fees which are included in service fees introduced in april 2007 the two new fees include a debit acceptance fee on debit payments volume and a creditcommercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume these fees supersede previously existing issuer programs used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives these changes are designed to simplify the fee structure and improve overall program efficiencies for visa usa and its issuers while continuing to support visa usa’s acceptance growth initiatives while visa usa believes that these fee changes will generate ongoing benefits visa usa does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact in 2007 of the new service fees introduced in the second half of fiscal 2007 growth in operating revenues was also attributable to adjustments from visa usa’s estimates of performance for volume and support incentive agreements as part of its regular quarterly review of these agreements 

visa usa incurred an operating loss in fiscal 2007 as a result of recording a litigation provision of 27 billion of which 19 billion was recorded in connection with the settlement of outstanding litigation with american express visa inc visa usa and visa international entered into an agreement with american express that became effective on november 9 2007 to resolve all current litigation between american express and visa usa and visa international and the related litigation between american express and five codefendant banks under the 

  

settlement agreement an initial payment of 113 billion will be made on or before march 31 2008 including 945 million from visa inc and 185 million from the five codefendant banks beginning march 31 2008 visa inc will pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million per quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion total future payments discounted at 472 over the payment term or 19 billion are reflected in the litigation provision on visa usa’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and longterm accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 visa usa intends to fund its payment obligations under the american express settlement with amounts in the escrow account in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan the remainder of the 27 billion litigation provision includes management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” related to the discover litigation and various other litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters see “ liquidity and capital resources ” and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

the effect of these litigation provisions on visa usa’s earnings was partially offset by the impacts of the introduction of new service fees during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the absence of substantial charges incurred in the prior year related to customer reimbursement for costs associated with visa usa’s holographic magnetic card impairment charges related to visa usa’s mini card license and business expenses related to a 2006 litigation settlement see “ operating revenues—service fees” and “operating expenses—administrative and other” 

in november 2006 visa usa announced plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions over the course of fiscal 2007 this action was intended to help visa usa better align personnel and contract staffing levels with fluctuating project demand as a result of this strategy visa usa reduced its total number of employees by approximately 5 of visa usa’s total workforce at december 31 2006 visa usa incurred severance and related personnel costs of approximately 13 million during fiscal 2007 associated with this program approximately 1 million in additional charges are expected in fiscal 2008 based upon current assumptions for the timing of employee terminations although visa usa believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its plan actual results may differ thereby requiring visa usa to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions at september 30 2007 the related liability in accrued compensation and benefits was 2 million 

in august 2007 visa usa completed the purchase of a parcel of land on the east coast of the united states and commenced construction of a new data center the new data center is intended to support visa usa’s technology objectives related to reliability scalability security and innovation visa usa anticipates that the data center will be completed in 2010 at an estimated total cost of 397 million see “liquidity and capital resources  ”

visa usa’s operating revenues consist of gross operating revenues reduced by payments made to customers and merchants under volume and support incentive arrangements gross operating revenues consist of service fees data processing fees international transaction fees and other revenues visa usa’s operating revenues are based upon aggregate payments volume reported by its members and transactional information accumulated by its transaction processing systems visa usa’s operating revenues are primarily generated from fees calculated on the payments volume of activity on visabranded cards which visa usa refers to as service fees and from the fees charged for providing transaction processing which visa usa refers to as data processing fees pricing varies and may be modified on a customerbycustomer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements service fees and data processing fees combined represent 82 81 and 81 of visa usa’s gross operating revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

visa usa does not earn revenues from or bear credit risk with respect to interest and fees paid by cardholders on visabranded cards issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining 

  

interest rates and fees paid by consumers and commercial establishments and most other competitive card features nor does visa usa earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance including the merchant discount rate acquiring customers which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants establish and earn these fees 

service fees 

service fees primarily reflect payments by customers for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the visa brand current quarter service fees are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to prior quarter payments volume as reported on customer quarterly operating certificates exclusive of pinbased debit volume these payments volumes also do not include cash disbursements obtained with visabranded cards balance transfers or convenience checks 

also included in service fees are acceptance fees which are used to support merchant acceptance and ongoing volume growth initiatives two new acceptance fees were introduced in april 2007 which apply to all consumer debit payments volume and all consumer credit and commercial payments volume these fees supersede previously existing issuer programs prior period revenues associated with previously existing issuer fees have been reclassified from other revenues to this category for comparative purposes in visa usa’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005

volume and support incentives 

volume and support incentives are contracts with financial institutions merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume increase card issuance and product acceptance 

  

and increase visabranded transactions these contracts which range in term from one to 13 years provide incentives based on payments volume growth or card issuance or provide marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements visa usa provides cash and other incentives to certain customers in exchange for their commitment to generate certain payments volume using visabranded products for an agreed period of time 

pricing varies and may be modified on a customerbycustomer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements in this regard volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers accordingly we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives management regularly reviews volume and support incentives and estimates of performance estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than management’s original expectation or to reflect contract amendments 

international transaction fees 

international transaction fees are assessed to customers on nonus transactions of usbased issuing financial institutions and us transactions of nonusbased issuing financial institutions international transaction fees are generally driven by crossborder payments volume which include the settlement of currency exchange activities in connection with the settlement of multicurrency transactions international transaction fees are influenced by levels of travel and the extent to which visabranded products are utilized for travel purposes these fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed 

other revenues 

other revenues represent optional card enhancements such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services cardholder services software development services and other services provided to visa usa’s customers visa international visa canada and visa europe software development services are provided on a time and materials basis primarily to visa international visa europe and visa canada prior period revenues associated with previous issuer fees which were superseded by new issuer acceptance fees discussed above have been reclassified to service fees for comparative purposes in visa usa’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

operating revenues 

operating revenues were 36 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively reflecting an increase of 06 billion or 22 the increase in operating revenues reflects increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume exclusive of pinbased debit volume which increased 9 and growth in transactions which increased 11 growth in operating revenues exceeded growth in payments and transactions volumes primarily due to newly introduced service fees while visa usa believes that these changes in fee structure will generate ongoing benefits visa usa does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts in fiscal 2007 of the new service fees 

 

 service fees 

payments volume on visabranded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter exclusive of pinbased debit volume is the basis for service fees payments volume exclusive of pinbased debit volume increased 105 billion or 9 to 13 trillion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to the april 2007 introduction of two new acceptance fees including a debit acceptance fee on all consumer debit payments volume and a creditcommercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume the increase in service fees from these new acceptance fees were offset by the corresponding elimination of previously existing issuer fees used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives the net impact of the new acceptance fees and the elimination of the existing issuer fees resulted in an increase to service fees of 190 million or 12 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

data processing fees 

the increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 data processing fees increased 13 broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from visa usa’s debit processing services related to nonvisa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volumebased discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers of the total data processing fees 122 million or 9 was collectively earned from visa international visa canada and visa europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

  

volume and support incentives 

the decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during management’s regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of 73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 36 million in fiscal 2006 as the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly we currently expect volume and support incentives to increase substantially during fiscal 2008 due to obligations assumed upon retirement of certain issuer programs during 2007 see note 13—restricted assets and liabilities and note 19— commitments and contingencies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts amendments to contracts or new contracts entered into during 2008 

the net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows 

 

    international transaction fees 

the increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by multicurrency payments volume which increased by 10 billion or 15 during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multicurrency payments volume reflecting more crossborder transactions as overall global travel has increased 

  

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased by 127 to 50 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to 22 billion in fiscal 2006 the increase primarily reflects the 27 billion litigation provision which represented 94 of that increase excluding the litigation provision operating expenses increased 191 million or 9 

 

 personnel 

personnel expense increased 4 in fiscal 2007 due to a 26 million charge representing the first installment of a onetime special bonus program of 51 million associated with the establishment of visa inc half of the 51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007 the other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of an initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met the remaining increase of 3 reflects severance expense for certain executives annual salary adjustments which were broadly in line with economic price increases offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007 

network edp and communications 

the increase in network edp and communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following 

 

  

 fees for data processing services related to processing transactions through nonvisa networks would be expected to grow over time as the worldwide migration from paperbased to electronic payments continues maintenance and equipment rental costs may continue to increase over time as visa usa continues to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain support functions 

advertising marketing and promotion 

the increase in advertising marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following 

 

  

   

visa usa assesses the effectiveness of all promotional activity and may continue joint promotional campaigns with its financial institution customers in the future expenses associated with visa extras would be expected to increase over time as payments volumes associated with enrolled payments products increase 

the remaining increase is attributable to additional promotional activity related to visa signature visa small business and consumer debit products these increases were offset by the absence of initial launch expenditures for visa usa’s new brand mark and card design which began in january 2006 and the “life takes visa” advertising campaign which began in february 2006 

visa international fees 

although visa usa’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature us economy fees paid to visa international increased due to a onetime fee waiver of 13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007 

professional and consulting fees 

professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following 

 

  

 visa usa continues to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain technology and support functions contractor and outsourcing expense could increase in the future should additional support functions be transitioned to an external provider 

administrative and other 

administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006 

 

  

  

 in addition after a review of claims submitted visa usa reduced the accrual for reimbursement to customers for production costs related to the discontinued use of visabranded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design by 11 million in fiscal 2007 

litigation provision 

litigation provision increased 26 billion reflecting a 19 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with american express future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted 

  

at 472 over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision the litigation provision also reflects management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” related to the discover litigation the american express and discover litigations are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account in accordance with our retrospective responsibility plan the remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters see “— liquidity and capital resources” and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

visa usa is a party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows 

 

  other income expense 

other income was 62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of 8 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in other income primarily reflects an increase in visa usa’s portion of equity earnings from visa international as a result of an increase in net income for visa international and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in visa usa’s investment portfolio from taxexempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities 

the following table sets forth the components of our other income expense for fiscal 2007 and 2006 

 

 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

the increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher visa international net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year 

  

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the retailers’ litigation matter interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal 2008 as a result of the american express litigation  for which accretion will be recorded beginning in october 2008 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

investment income net 

the increase in investment income net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects an increase in interest income due to a shift in the visa usa’s investment strategy from taxexempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixedincome investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year 

income taxes 

visa usa’s effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state statutory rates and allowable adjustments to taxable income the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23 represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35 for the prior year represented a tax expense the 23 effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year this benefit was less than would otherwise have been realized primarily as a result of an adjustment in a reserve related to litigation 

the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 

 visa usa’s fiscal 2007 statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of 27 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation this provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the american express litigation and management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 related to the discover litigation and other matters for tax purposes the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of 778 million related to these payments which is net of a reserve to reflect visa usa’s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized 

minority interest 

the decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to visa usa’s plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions see note 16—workforce reduction to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements  

  

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

operating revenues 

operating revenues were 30 billion and 27 billion in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively reflecting an increase of 03 billion or 11 the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume and transactions both of which increased 17 during fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2006 growth in consumer credit volume continued to favorably impact operating revenues driven largely by visa signature visa usa’s premium credit platform which generates higher fees operating revenues were also impacted by growth in debit volumes and transactions processed reflecting the ongoing impact of certain member conversions to the debit interlink platform 

 

 service fees 

the increase in service fees in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 of 11 was broadly in line with the growth in underlying payments volume exclusive of pinbased debit volume which increased 1510 billion or 15 to 12 trillion in fiscal 2006 reflecting increased spending on all product platforms volumes this increase was offset by a decrease in acceptance fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting lower revenues of 36 million related to a merchant incentive program the program collects fees from customers and the funds are intended to support various merchant programs designed to build payments volume and increase product acceptance beginning in fiscal 2006 the program was modified requiring specific use of related revenues revenues related to the merchant incentive program were therefore deferred and recognized only when expended as designated for specific acceptance programs 

data processing fees 

data processing fees increased 10 primarily due to a 17 increase in the number of transactions processed in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in transactions processed outpaced the increase in data processing fees in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher volumebased discounts resulting from consolidations among financial institution customers despite solid growth in the mix of debit transactions during fiscal 2006 reflecting conversion of various member financial institutions to interlink visa usa’s pinbased debit platform the impact of volumebased discounts across all product lines outpaced the impact of growth of debit transactions of the total data processing fees 122 million and 121 million was earned from visa international visa canada and visa europe in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively 

volume and support incentives 

growth of volume and support incentives in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the execution of new agreements in support of visa usa partnership programs with existing customers and cobranding programs with existing customers and new merchants 

  

the net asset liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows 

 

    international transaction fees 

international transaction fees increased 11 while multicurrency payments volume increased 9 or 44 billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in international transaction fees was higher than the growth in multicurrency payments volume due to the differential between foreign and domestic interchange rates 

other revenues 

the increase in other revenues in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected 

 

  

 operating expenses 

total operating expenses were unchanged at 22 billion for both fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively visa usa reduced its total operating expenses as a percentage of total operating revenues to 75 in fiscal 2006 compared to 83 in fiscal 2005 due to more effective expense management and the absence of certain charges associated with visa usa’s litigation provision expense recorded in fiscal 2005 the charge to litigation provision expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the multicurrency matter that was subsequently settled in fiscal 2006 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

 

   

personnel 

the increase in personnel expense in fiscal 2006 reflected annual salary adjustments which were broadly in line with inflation and a 4 increase in the number of employees in support of various corporate initiatives at visa usa 

network edp and communications 

the decrease in network edp and communications expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected a decrease in software expense of 9 million due to visa usa lowering its threshold for capitalizing software from a unit cost greater than 25000 or an aggregate purchase cost greater than 250000 to a unit cost or aggregate purchase cost greater than 10000 

advertising marketing and promotion 

the increase in advertising marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected higher expenditures for visa usa’s new brand mark and card design launch which began in january 2006 and its “life takes visa” advertising campaign launched in february 2006 

visa international fees 

the decrease in visa international fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected reductions in visa usa’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes as global emerging markets experienced higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature us economy 

professional and consulting fees 

professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to professional contracting fees incurred to provide analysis and support for various programs and projects including product development and innovation call center operations and global processing and system development additional expenses for accounting and auditing services were incurred in conjunction with visa usa’s review of its internal controls over financial reporting and additional legal fees were incurred to support ongoing litigation matters 

administrative and other 

administrative and other expense increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting the following nonrecurring expenses 

 

  

  

   

litigation provision 

the decrease in the litigation provision in fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year was driven by the following 

 

  

  

 total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows 

 

 other income expense 

other expense was 8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to other income of 3 million in fiscal 2005 the decrease in other income primarily reflected the absence of a nonrecurring gainonsale of a joint venture interest in vital processing services llc a financial transaction processor for acquirers and merchants which occurred in fiscal 2005 and lower equity in earnings related to visa usa’s ownership in visa international 

 

 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected lower visa international net income and a decrease in visa usa’s proportionate equity interest in visa international earnings from the prior year reflecting the fact that visa usa comprised a lower percentage of total payments volumebased fees paid to visa international the decrease also reflected the absence of equity in earnings from vital processing services llc following the sale of visa usa’s 50 equity interest in the joint venture during fiscal 2005 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of accretion expense on litigation for certain merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff’s class in the retailers’ litigation matter these litigation matters were settled in the first six months of fiscal 2005 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

investment income net 

the decrease in investment income net in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of a 42 million gain on the sale of visa usa’s 50 equity interest in vital processing services llc in fiscal 2005 the decrease was offset by higher earnings on fixedincome investment securities due to higher average investment balances and higher market interest rates for current year periods compared to the prior year 

income taxes 

visa usa’s effective tax rate decreased to 35 in fiscal 2006 from 40 in fiscal 2005 the lower effective tax rate is primarily attributable to additional tax benefits granted by the state related to visa usa’s tax filing methodology in fiscal 2006 the decrease also reflects the absence of a onetime remeasurement of deferred tax assets related to the adoption of a new state tax filing methodology which occurred in 2005 

the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 

 minority interest 

in september 2005 inovant inc sold a 10 interest in inovant to visa europe and a 6 interest to visa international and its cemea region at a price equivalent to the founder’s cost thereby reducing visa usa’s ownership of inovant from 85 to 69 this increase in third party ownership had a full year impact in fiscal 2006 resulting in increased minority interest expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

visa usa maintains comprehensive cash flow forecasts to project visa usa’s shortterm and longterm liquidity needs and maintains controls and governance over spending and investment decisions visa usa’s corporate investment policy was approved by its board of directors and visa usa’s asset and liability committee oversees visa usa’s treasury activity 

visa usa requires capital resources and liquidity to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 the objectives of visa usa’s investment policy are to maintain integrity of principal to provide adequate liquidity to cover settlement contingency scenarios and operating expenditures including payments of principal and interest on its outstanding debt inclusive of settled litigation and to optimize investment income earned within acceptable risk criteria 

settlement of certain debit transactions due from customers participating in the debit processing service and due to payment networks represents visa usa’s most consistent liquidity requirement these settlement receivables are generally collected on the business day following the day in which the transactions were processed and settlement payables are typically satisfied two days following the processing day visa usa maintains a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net debit settlement during fiscal 2007 visa usa funded average daily net settlement payable balances of 62 million with the highest daily balance being 188 million during fiscal 2006 visa usa funded average daily net settlement payable balances of 62 million with the highest daily balance being 221 million visa international is visa usa’s settlement agent for credit and all other debit transactions 

sources of liquidity 

visa usa’s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and a fixedincome investment portfolio funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investment securities or longterm availableforsale investment securities based on visa usa’s estimates of when those funds will be needed at september 30 2007 september 30 2006 and september 30 2005 visa usa’s total liquid assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investment securities and longterm investment securities were 18 billion 14 billion and 11 billion respectively as reflected in the following table 

 

 on november 1 2007 visa inc visa usa and visa international entered into an agreement with american express to resolve all current litigation between american express and visa usa and visa international and the related litigation between american express and five codefendant banks under the settlement agreement an initial payment of 113 billion will be made on or before march 31 2008 including 945 million from visa inc and 185 million from the five codefendant banks beginning march 31 2008 visa inc will pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million per quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion total future payments discounted at 472 over the payment term or 

  

19 billion are reflected in the litigation provision on visa usa’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and longterm accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 visa inc expects to fund future payments under the american express settlement under its retrospective responsibility plan the plan includes an escrow arrangement in which visa inc will deposit a portion of the expected proceeds from an initial public offering as determined by the visa inc litigation committee a committee established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among visa inc visa international visa usa and the members of the committee all of whom are affiliated with or acting for certain visa usa members into an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in covered litigation will be payable the plan also includes a loss sharing agreement in which visa usa members that are parties to the agreement are responsible for covered litigation in proportion to the member’s ownership percentage as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation this plan includes multistep mechanisms to fund financial obligations of visa usa and visa international related to certain litigation including the american express litigation covered by this settlement agreement see “ business—retrospective responsibility plan ” 

visa usa has an uncommitted credit facility with visa international whereby visa usa or visa international may provide each other shortterm financing with a maximum term of five business days neither visa usa nor visa international has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company there were no outstanding balances at september 30 2007 or september 30 2006 under this arrangement 

in july 2006 visa usa’s board of directors approved a plan to build a new data center on the east coast of the united states at an estimated cost of 397 million which visa usa plans to fund with its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows visa usa completed the land purchase and began construction in fiscal 2007 construction is expected to continue through fiscal 2010 upon completion visa usa will migrate its current east coast data center to this new facility visa usa assesses the estimated cost to build the new data center on a regular basis and the corresponding liquidity required during each stage of the building process in march 2007 visa usa executed two performance bond agreements with the county in which the east coast data center will be constructed to provide assurance that land development and construction will be completed as planned the bonds have a total value of 2 million and become due in the event that land development and construction are not completed as planned at september 30 2007 visa usa had remaining committed obligations of 186 million related to the new data center 

visa usa had negative working capital at september 30 2007 primarily due to the financial statement impact of the american express litigation see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements visa usa believes its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows will be sufficient to fund its business operations working capital requirements capital expenditures future strategic developments and other commitments during fiscal 2008 visa usa anticipates that future increases in its operating cash flows from new acceptance fees initiated in april 2007 will be offset by obligations assumed in connection with the retirement of two restricted liability programs see note 19—commitments and contingencies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements visa usa’s ability to maintain these levels of liquidity could be adversely affected by several factors described under “ risk factors ” including the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which visa usa is a party as part of visa inc visa usa will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of its operating performance and other relevant circumstances 

visa usa has certain offbalance sheet commitments and contingencies that may have significant future cash requirements see “ offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations ” and note 12—pension postretirement and other benefits  note 14—debt  note 19—commitments and contingencies and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

cash flow data 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 71 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year the increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with visa usa’s visa check card program in the prior year see note 13—restricted assets and liabilities to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the increase also reflects higher noncash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 47 million during fiscal 2006 primarily due to payments on litigation matters largely accrued for in fiscal 2005 but settled and paid for in fiscal 2006 in addition lower levels of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities these decreases were offset by increases in the liability position of volume and support incentives and higher net income adjusted for noncash items 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above in addition investment securities purchasing activity net of sales and maturities was higher during fiscal 2007 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily reflects fewer funds available for the purchase of investment securities as a result of onetime litigation settlements including the multicurrency matter 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on visa usa’s series a senior secured notes due december 2007 and series b senior secured notes due december 2012 see note 14 – debt to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements cash requirements remained stable as the outstanding debt decreased during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under visa usa’s bylaws in effect prior to the reorganization visa usa indemnified issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts travelers cheques or other instruments processed in accordance with its operating regulations visa international is visa usa’s settlement agent visa usa partially indemnifies visa international from losses due to the failure of a member the term and the amount of the indemnity is not limited visa usa is responsible for losses up to 10 million plus 003 of visa usa’s payments volume excluding interlink for the year preceding the loss or approximately 40 million in fiscal 2007 currently settlement is guaranteed by members through the indemnification provisions in the bylaws of visa usa and visa 

  

international and through separate member agreements with the individual members upon the closing of an initial public offering members will no longer indemnify visa for settlement obligations other than their own settlement obligations and those of certain other participants in the system sponsored by the member 

in conjunction with visa usa’s purchase of inovant inc from visa international on january 1 2003 visa usa agreed to indemnify visa international in the event of future tax liability in connection with an adverse determination by a taxing authority resulting from the sale of stock of inovant inc the indemnification is effective for 10 years and extends through 30 years or the statute of limitation in the event of a tax extension for the year of the stock repurchase the maximum probabilityweighted liability is considered immaterial and no liability has been accrued for this obligation 

visa usa has no special purpose entities or offbalance sheet debt other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business and reflected in the contractual obligations table below 

contractual obligations 

visa usa’s contractual commitments will have an impact on its future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both onand offbalance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations at the end of fiscal 2007 visa usa believes that it will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and its existing cash balances 

 

          

see note 14—debt  note 19—commitments and contingencies and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

visa usa also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and other incentive plans see note 12—pension postretirement and other benefits to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

related parties 

prior to the closing of the reorganization during october 2007 visa usa conducted business as a nonstock nonassessable membership corporation the principal members of visa usa were approximately 1600 financial institutions that participated directly in visa usa’s payment programs in addition there were approximately 11700 associate and participant members that participated in visa usa’s payment programs through one or more principal members 

at september 30 2007 visa usa’s board of directors was comprised of exofficio directors individuals who were also officers of various member financial institutions that are also visa usa’s customers and independent directors visa usa generated total operating revenues of approximately 903 million 808 million and 884 million from financial institutions with officers that also served on its board of directors in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 a significant portion of visa usa’s operating revenues were generated from one customer with an officer that also served on the board of directors operating revenues from this customer were 454 million or 13 408 million or 14 and 345 million or 13 of visa usa’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally operating revenues generated from a customer which did not have an officer on the board were 384 million or 11 in fiscal 2007 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of visa usa’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 see note 18—related parties to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the loss of these customers could adversely impact visa usa’s operating revenues and operating income 

critical accounting estimates 

visa usa’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 2—significant accounting policies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of visa usa’s consolidated financial statements visa usa has established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of visa usa’s current accounting policies involving significant management judgment 

  

management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate visa usa’s reported financial results as they require management’s most subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

   

   

   

 seasonality 

visa usa does not experience a pronounced seasonality in its business no individual quarter of fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005 has historically accounted for more than 30 of annual revenue 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for the benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 visa usa expects the adoption of fin 48 on october 1 2007 will result in an increase to accumulated net income of approximately 63 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “ fair value measurements ” sfas 157 which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 visa usa is in the process of determining the effect if any of adopting sfas 157 on its consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “ employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r ” sfas 158 which amends fasb issued statement no 87 “ employers’ accounting for pensions ” sfas 87 and fasb issued statement no 106 “ employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions ” sfas 106 to require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet under sfas 158 

  

gains and losses prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under sfas 87 and sfas 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax effects until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost in addition sfas 158 requires that the measurement date the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets are measured be the company’s fiscal year end visa usa adopted the recognition provision of sfas 158 at september 30 2007 

visa usa adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 at october 1 2006 using the 15month approach under this approach visa usa recorded an additional 3 months of net periodic benefit cost covering the period between the previous measurement date of june 30 2006 and september 30 2006 the benefit expense of 87 million net of tax was recorded as a reduction to beginning accumulated net loss income at october 1 2006 

the effects to visa usa of applying the recognition and measurementdate provision of sfas 158 on individual line items in visa usa’s consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 are as follows 

 

 in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to sfas 115 ” sfas 159 sfas 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis under a fair value option sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after november 15 2007 visa usa is in the process of determining the effect if any of adopting sfas 159 on its consolidated financial statements 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices visa usa is exposed to two significant market risks that could affect its business including changes in interest rates and equity prices visa usa does not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

a significant portion of visa usa’s investment portfolio assets is held in fixedincome securities these assets are reflected as cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm availableforsale investments visa usa does not consider its cash and cash equivalents or its auction rate securities to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities or repricing characteristics of three months or less the fair value balances of visa usa’s shortterm and longterm availableforsale investments at september 30 2007 and september 30 2006 include 

 

 visa usa manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing primarily in rateadjustable or shortterm securities and a modest amount of fixed rate government agency securities to support longer term obligations however visa usa’s efforts do not provide complete assurance that it will be protected from interest rate fluctuations a sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of visa usa’s investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the fair value of the investment portfolio by approximately 7 million or 2 million respectively at september 30 2007 and approximately 12 million and 6 million respectively at september 30 2006 

equity price risk 

visa usa owns equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with visa usa’s longterm incentive and deferred compensation plans equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans for these plans employees bear the risk of market fluctuations gains and losses experienced on these equity investments are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense respectively the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense respectively by 5 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006

 item 11 executive compensation tableend compensation discussion and analysis 

compensation philosophy and objectives 

our global total rewards programs have been designed to support a globally consistent philosophy while accommodating regulatory cultural or practical differences in geographies we expect this approach will enable us to attract retain and motivate our employees and emphasize performancebased differentiation of compensation based on corporate and stockholder values in order to be competitively positioned to attract and retain key executives we target total compensation for executive officers including salary annual incentive target and longterm incentive value at the 50th percentile of compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers of the companies comprising our compensation peer group with actual positioning determined by individual group or company performance allowing for 75th percentile of our compensation peer group’s total compensation to reward key executive officers who demonstrate exceptional experience skills competencies and performance in addition we expect to increase the performancebased portion of an executive officer’s target pay by increasing the percentage of target pay attributable to annual and longterm incentives and decreasing the percentage of target pay attributable to base salary 

our compensation committee believes that the most effective executive compensation program is one that is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual longterm and strategic goals and that aligns executive officers’ interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance that meets or exceeds established goals with the ultimate objective of increasing stockholder value our compensation committee will evaluate both performance and compensation to ensure that we maintain our ability to attract and retain superior employees in key positions relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of our peer companies and that compensation paid to our key employees remains competitive to that end our compensation committee believes compensation provided to our executive officers should include both cash compensation and equitybased compensation 

role of chief executive officer in compensation decisions 

our chief executive officer will annually review the performance of each executive officer other than the chief executive officer whose performance will be reviewed by the compensation committee the conclusions reached and recommendations based on these reviews including such items as salary adjustments and annual award amounts will be presented to the compensation committee the compensation committee can exercise discretion in modifying any compensation recommendations or awards to executive officers and will approve all compensation decisions for our executive officers 

setting executive compensation 

our compensation committee will structure executive compensation to include an annual cash incentive component and a longterm equity incentive component to motivate our executive officers to achieve their business goals and reward them for achieving such goals 

we have retained towers perrin a global human resources consulting firm to conduct an annual review of our total compensation program with respect to executive compensation we will conduct an annual benchmark review of the aggregate level of our executive compensation as well as the combination of elements used to compensate our executive officers this review will be based on public information and third party surveys of executive compensation paid by publicly traded peer companies of similar size and focus including financial services processing technology and business services companies which we refer to collectively as the compensation peer group 

  

several criteria were used to identify the compensation peer group 1 industry—we expect that we will compete for talent with financial services processing high technology and business services companies 2 geography—to ensure that the companies identified as peers have broad international presence because we are a company with global operations and 3 financial scope—management talent should be similar to that in companies that have similar financial characteristics eg revenues market capitalization and total assets the companies currently comprising the compensation peer group are 

 

 the compensation peer group is divided into two groups for purposes of compensation benchmarking for “equivalent sized” companies revenues generally less than 30 billion we select benchmark positions that most accurately reflect the responsibilities of our executive officers for large companies revenues generally greater than 30 billion we select benchmark positions at the business unit level where available and positions with reporting levels that are generally one reporting level below comparable positions at visa and the “equivalent sized” companies in the compensation peer group 

in addition our compensation committee will take into account publicly available data relating to the compensation practices and policies of other companies within and outside our industry 

the compensation peer group provides a relevant benchmark of compensation levels from external sources and allows us to assess the compensation practices of our primary competitors for employees in addition the compensation peer group indicates the practices of leading organizations of comparable scope and focus and provides a benchmark for establishing corporate performance expectations for incentive programs 

a significant percentage of total compensation will be allocated to incentivebased compensation as a result of the compensation philosophy mentioned above although our compensation committee has not adopted any formal guidelines for allocating total compensation between either cash or noncash annual or longterm incentive compensation we intend to implement and maintain compensation plans that tie a substantial portion of our executives’ overall compensation to the achievement of our company goals 

we also use signon bonuses from time to time when recruiting executive officers we may agree to pay a signon bonus to make our employment offers competitive given that candidates who are currently employed at other companies frequently forfeit potential compensation by accepting employment with us 

generally prior to the completion of the reorganization we had not established standard compensation arrangements for our executive officers existing compensation arrangements vary among our named executive officers due in part to the differences among the individual agreements between those named executive officers who were historically employed by visa usa versus inovant in the case of messrs saunders pollitt and morris who have recently been recruited into the organization their compensation arrangements reflect our efforts to provide competitive compensation packages to attract a highlyqualified chief executive officer and 

  

executive officers into the organization with the requisite skills and experience to lead the organization during a time of transition further following our proposed initial public offering we intend to adopt internallyconsistent compensation programs and policies for our named executive officers our compensation committee is considering new employment agreements for each of our named executive officers 

executive compensation components 

the principal components of compensation of our executive officers are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our total compensation package is primarily weighted toward the following three components base salary annual incentive compensation and longterm incentive compensation in setting each executive’s target total compensation we benchmark his or her total compensation package as well as each component of the compensation package against our compensation peer group we do not use a formulaic approach in determining the appropriate compensation mix rather we determine each executive’s actual base salary annual incentive target and longterm incentive target by considering both the external market data and internal equity amongst our executives based on their experience and performance and the nature and scope of their roles in our organization our goal in setting the components of compensation is to provide a competitive total compensation package that balances market competitiveness to attract and retain talented employees with internal equity and provides a sufficient portion of total compensation tied to individual and corporate performance 

fiscal 2007 was a transition year for visa in addition to leading and managing our payments network business our senior executives were tasked with various responsibilities relating to our reorganization because of the transitional nature of fiscal 2007 actual annual incentive awards for messrs partridge sheedy and floum were based on their individual performance as against qualitative metrics and their actual longterm awards were based on visa usa’s achievement of corporate goals both awards were approved by the compensation committee of visa usa mr saunders’s actual annual and longterm incentive awards were determined based on the achievement of his performance measures outlined in his executive chairman letter see “—employment arrangements” 

in fiscal 2008 we anticipate that annual incentive awards will be based on the executive’s individual performance and our attainment of certain quantitative and qualitative corporate goals which we currently expect to set in february 2008 beginning in fiscal 2008 longterm incentive awards will be made in the form of equity grants with the amount of the awards based on results from the annual benchmark review a review of the appropriate mix of compensation elements the experience and performance of each executive and any employment agreement see “— employment arrangements ” actual 2008 compensation will be recommended by mr saunders our chief executive officer and approved by our compensation committee except for mr saunders whose compensation is determined and approved by our compensation committee 

in 2007 we awarded a special bonus to our named executive officers along with other eligible employees upon completion of our reorganization this was a discretionary bonus award which was in addition to each executive’s ongoing total compensation and did not impact the determination of each compensation component see “— special bonus program ” 

  

base salary 

the purpose of base salary is to reward demonstrated experience skills and competencies relative to the market value of the job our compensation committee approves base salaries of all of our executive officers base salaries are targeted at the median of the compensation peer group for comparable skills and experience but we allow for flexibility in salaries above or below the median based on area of expertise performance or proficiency 

during its review of base salaries for executive officers the compensation committee will consider 

 

  

  

 salary levels are typically considered annually as part of our performance review process as well as upon a promotion or other change in job responsibilities 

annual incentive programs 

our annual cash bonus programs consist of i the visa usa annual incentive plan pursuant to which bonuses were awarded in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 but which was terminated at the end of fiscal 2007 and ii the visa inc annual incentive plan which governs cash awards in fiscal 2008 and in the future 

visa usa annual incentive plan  prior to the completion of the reorganization visa usa and its majorityowned subsidiary inovant maintained annual incentive plans that provided for annual cash bonuses based on the achievement of preestablished performance targets and goals in addition to individual performance the use of preestablished performance targets and goals assisted in aligning an executive officer’s compensation with the entity’s operating and financial results however visa usa recognized that important aspects of executive officers’ contributions to visa’s success were not properly evaluated based solely on achievement of performance targets and goals especially in light of the challenges and uncertainties presented by the reorganization transactions accordingly in fiscal 2007 visa usa took into consideration an individual performance component which allowed the board of directors or committee the discretion to further adjust awards 

the maximum aggregate level of awards for all eligible employees under the visa usa annual incentive plan which we refer to as the incentive plan pool was determined based on the actual combined performance of visa usa and inovant as compared to preestablished performance goals both the performance metrics and actual results were determined on the basis of combining the metrics and results of the two entities the performance metrics weighting target performance level and actual performance results for fiscal 2007 are displayed in the following table 

 

    

achievement of corporate and individual performance targets impacted the amount of the bonuses payable to visa usa executives under the 2007 visa usa incentive plan although the human resources and compensation committee of the visa usa board of directors retained discretion in determining any adjustments to these awards based on each executive officer’s individual contribution to corporate results 

the funding level of the incentive plan pool was determined by corporate results compared with the corporate targets as stated above messrs sheedy’s floum’s and partridge’s bonus payouts were based on the achievement of these corporate goals and evaluation by the human resources and compensation committee of individual performance against individual goals under the visa usa annual incentive plan each of messrs sheedy floum and partridge was eligible to receive an annual bonus payment from zero to 200 of his target bonus for fiscal 2007 messrs sheedy and partridge received the maximum payout 200 of their respective target awards under this plan because in addition to excelling in the performance of their preexisting duties they both held key substantive managerial roles in connection with the reorganization in mr sheedy’s case in addition to his preexisting duties of leading visa usa’s interchange strategy he served as principal financial officer for visa inc during this critical period including being responsible for all finance aspects of the reorganization and the form s4 registration process in mr partridge’s case in addition to his preexisting duties of leading the inovant processing subsidiary he managed the office of transition management for visa inc including devising the organizational structure for visa inc the human resources and compensation committee determined that mr floum had done an excellent job of managing visa usa’s litigation during fiscal 2007 in addition mr floum substantially contributed to the design of the visa inc retrospective responsibility plan which was designed so that liability for the covered litigation would remain with the members of visa usa while the retrospective responsibility plan was a key component of the reorganization mr floum did not carry the same level of daily managerial duties in connection with the reorganization as did messrs sheedy and partridge thus the committee believed that it was appropriate to award mr floum a lower percentage bonus than was appropriate for messrs sheedy and partridge 

mr partridge’s individual performance goals for fiscal 2007 were qualitative not quantitative in nature and were not weighted they consisted of i managing inovant including with regard to system performance efficiency and customer satisfaction during the fiscal year ii managing the organizational transition management team during our reorganization including all organizational aspects of the reorganization iii leading the business negotiations regarding the framework agreement with visa europe and iv serving as chief executive officer of visa usa for a portion of the year the committee determined that mr partridge exceeded his individual performance goals and awarded him the maximum annual award of 200 of his target bonus additionally the committee used its discretion to award mr partridge an additional annual incentive plan award equal to 448000 as described in the footnotes following “— summary compensation table ” 

mr sheedy’s individual performance goals for fiscal 2007 were qualitative not quantitative in nature and were not weighted they consisted of i managing interchange strategy and merchant acceptance in the us region and ii managing the finance function during our reorganization including all finance aspects of the reorganization the committee determined that mr sheedy exceeded his individual performance goals and awarded him the maximum annual award of 200 of his target bonus 

mr floum’s individual performance goals for fiscal 2007 were qualitative not quantitative in nature and were not weighted they consisted of i managing the legal and government relations functions for visa usa and ii leading certain aspects of the reorganization on behalf of visa usa including the creation of the retrospective responsibility plan relating to the covered litigation the committee determined that mr floum had exceeded his individual performance goals and awarded him 175 of his target bonus 

visa inc annual incentive plan the visa inc incentive plan which we refer to as our annual incentive program has been designed to reward annual performance and achievement of strategic goals align employee interests with those of our stockholders and provide marketcompetitive compensation to employees on an individual employee basis the annual incentive program will be funded based on global corporate performance 

  

metrics for the fiscal year the compensation committee is currently in the process of determining the corporate performance measures the compensation committee will establish target incentives at the median of our compensation peer group consistent with local market practice and allow individual awards to be allocated based on a combination of corporate group and individual performance measures which will vary by level and scope of position performance is measured and award amounts are determined after the completion of each fiscal year at the most senior levels in the organization the measures used to determine awards will be heavily weighted toward corporate performance with a small portion dependent on either group or individual performance goals 

for our chief executive officer 80 of the annual award will depend on the visa inc corporate performance measures which will be defined by our compensation committee the remaining 20 will be determined by the compensation committee based on individual performance measures the compensation committee determined that the split of 80 corporate measures and 20 individual performance measures for the chief executive officer appropriately reflects his responsibility for the overall management of visa and correspondingly aligns his goals most closely with visa’s corporate goals for mr saunders the individual performance measures are being developed by the compensation committee more information about mr saunders’s employment arrangements can be found under “— executive compensation and director compensation tables—summary compensation table ” and “— employment arrangements ” 

for the other executive officers 70 of the annual award will be determined based on the corporate performance measures the remaining 30 will be determined by the chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee based on either group or individual performance measures the compensation committee determined that the split of 70 corporate and 30 individualgroup performance for our other executive officers appropriately reflects that each of these officers shares the primary goals and objectives of the overall corporation but also recognizes the importance of the goals that relate solely to their area of responsibility 

under the plan target incentive opportunities are expressed as a percentage of base salary based on position market pay levels and our overall compensation philosophy which emphasizes performance the 2008 target annual incentive awards for our named executive officers as defined under “ —summary compensation table ” expressed as a percentage of base salary are as follows 

 

 actual awards can range from 0 to 200 of these target awards based on actual performance results 

longterm incentive compensation 

prior to the reorganization cashbased longterm incentive plan or ltip awards were generally provided through plans maintained by visa usa and its majorityowned subsidiary inovant although no new cash ltip awards will be made under these longterm cash incentive plans the plans will remain in effect for the past awards that have not yet vested beginning in fiscal 2008 we intend to provide longterm incentive compensation for our employees pursuant to the visa inc 2007 equity incentive compensation plan 

for our chief executive officer longterm incentive compensation is provided pursuant to his employment letter in setting longterm incentive compensation for our chief executive officer we recognized that not only 

  

would this individual need to have the requisite skills experience and leadership abilities to manage our complex business but also that the individual would be asked to manage and grow our business at a time of great transition we recognized that our chief executive officer would face significantly greater risks and challenges at our company during this time of transition similar to the decision process for our other named executive officers mr saunders’s longterm performance bonus was determined by considering mr saunders’s individual contributions to our corporate performance and success mr saunders’s compensation package reflected the transition governance committee’s belief in the importance of compensating mr saunders competitively for his unique contribution to our success during this challenging transitional period see “ —employment arrangements ” 

visa usa longterm incentive plan  this plan is a cashbased plan in which awards vest at the end of a threeyear plan cycle at the beginning of the plan cycle each participant is granted a target award which at the end of the first year is adjusted by the human resources and compensation committee up or down from 0 to 220 based on the combined corporate performance of visa usa and inovant 

for target awards granted at the beginning of fiscal 2007 under this longterm cash incentive plan the corporate performance metrics weighting target performance level and actual performance results are the same as for the visa usa annual incentive plan described above these performance results for fiscal 2007 resulted in a 184 adjustment to target awards for messrs sheedy floum and partridge 

the target award adjusted by this performancedetermined ratio will be subject to vesting this nonvested award will be automatically deferred for the remaining two years in the plan cycle and credited to an individual account that is further credited with gains or losses from certain fidelity fund investments that the participant may select at the end of the plan cycle if the executive is still an employee the award becomes vested and payable to the participant 

visa inc 2007 equity incentive compensation plan  the visa inc 2007 equity incentive compensation plan which we refer to as the equity incentive plan was adopted to award longterm compensation following the reorganization the equity incentive plan is designed to align management interests with those of stockholders provide opportunities for wealth creation and ownership and encourage a longterm focus which we believe promotes retention 

the equity incentive plan is intended to promote our longterm success and increase stockholder value by attracting motivating and retaining our nonemployee directors officers employees and consultants and those of our subsidiaries to achieve this purpose the equity incentive plan allows the flexibility to grant or award stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock awards restricted stock units performance unit awards performance share awards cashbased awards and other equitybased awards to eligible persons covering a total of up to 59000000 shares of class a common stock 

the equity incentive plan became effective in october 2007 upon the completion of the reorganization the equity incentive plan will continue in effect until all of the common stock available under the equity incentive plan is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed unless the plan is terminated earlier by our board of directors no awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date 

the compensation committee administers the equity incentive plan and determines the nonemployee directors employees and consultants that may be granted awards under the equity incentive plan the size and types of awards the terms and conditions of awards the timing of awards and the form and content of the award agreements 

it is anticipated that the initial grants made under this plan will be made in fiscal 2008

although it is not an ongoing element of our compensation plans we instituted a special broadbased bonus program for all eligible employees at the end of fiscal 2007 to reward performance during our reorganization and 

  

to encourage all of those employees to focus on the continuing operations of each business unit while at the same time preparing the organization to become a public company and achieve the anticipated benefits of the reorganization under this program messrs saunders sheedy floum and partridge each received a special cash bonus at the end of fiscal 2007 which is disclosed in the “— bonus ” column of “ —summary compensation table ” in determining the special bonus awards for messrs sheedy floum and partridge mr saunders made a subjective assessment with regard to these onetime bonus awards without taking into account any particular percentage target or external benchmark or criteria in determining mr saunders’s award under the special bonus program the transition governance committee believed it was appropriate to award him an amount equal to 50 of his annual base salary or 425000 under this special bonus program all eligible employees including these executive officers are also expected to receive restricted stock with a value equal to the amount of his previous special cash bonus upon the successful completion of our proposed initial public offering subject to approval by our compensation committee 

retirement and other benefits 

our benefits programs are designed to be competitive costeffective and compliant with local regulations we generally target the median of the market with flexibility to position above or below the median where local conditions dictate it is our objective to provide core benefits including medical retirement life insurance paid time off and leaves of absence to all employees and to allow for supplementary noncore benefits based on local market practice and local culture 

we sponsor a taxqualified defined benefit pension plan which we refer to as the retirement plan and a taxqualified defined contribution thrift plan which we refer to as the thrift plan to provide market driven retirement benefits to all eligible employees in the united states we have changed the design of the defined benefit plan to a cashbalance plan effective for 2008 to better align our benefits with our peer companies and the overall market in addition to the taxqualified retirement plan and the thrift plan we maintain a nonqualified excess retirement plan and a nonqualified excess thrift plan to make up for the limitations imposed on these taxqualified plans by the internal revenue code we sponsor an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan which we refer to as the deferred compensation plan which allows executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their annual incentive awards and their longterm cash incentive awards or signon bonuses to help them with tax planning and to provide competitive benefits see “ —visa retirement plan  ” “ —visa thrift plan ” and “ —nonqualified deferred compensation ” 

perquisites and other personal benefits 

we may provide executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to attract and retain qualified executive officers and to facilitate the performance of executive officers’ management responsibilities as part of our reorganization and review of our overall compensation strategy we eliminated several perquisites for our executive officers including car allowances and financial planning beginning in fiscal 2008 see footnote 8 to “— summary compensation table ” for fiscal 2008 we also have instituted a policy that allows the chief executive officer the president the chief operating officer and other key employees or their spouses as approved by the chief executive officer to use a corporate aircraft for limited personal use business priorities will always take precedence over personal usage these employees will be responsible for all income taxes related to their personal usage 

severance 

we believe that it is appropriate to provide severance pay to executives whose employment is involuntarily terminated by us without cause and in some cases voluntarily terminated by the executive for good reason to provide transition income replacement which will allow them to focus on our business priorities in some cases a severance package includes a grossup payment relating to any parachute payment excise taxes imposed on an executive the amount of severance pay is primarily determined based on competitive benchmarking of severance benefits for similarlysituated executives with comparable scope and responsibility in other companies 

  

existing severance arrangements currently vary among executive officers based on the individual agreements with the visa entity with whom they were historically employed it is our current intention that in connection with our proposed initial public offering and subject to the discretion of our board new employment agreements will be entered into with each of the named executive officers with the goal that the new agreements will have longer terms and be more internally consistent these new agreements are generally expected to provide for at least a threeyear employment period commencing immediately prior to the completion of this offering and to have such other terms as are customarily included in employment agreements including severance provisions 

see “— employment arrangements ” and “— potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol ” 

tax implications 

deductibility of executive compensation 

section 162m of the internal revenue code limits the ability of visa to deduct for tax purposes compensation over 1000000 to our principal executive officer or any one of our three highest paid executive officers other than our principal executive officer or principal financial officer who are employed by us on the last day of our taxable year unless in general the compensation is paid pursuant to a plan that is performance related nondiscretionary and has been approved by visa’s stockholders no such limitation on deductibility was applicable to fiscal 2007 compensation from awards made before our first annual meeting in 2012 under plans that existed before the closing of our proposed initial public offering will be exempt from the deduction limitations otherwise imposed by section 162m if the plan is not materially modified during this period the compensation committee will review and consider the deductibility of executive compensation under section 162m and may authorize certain payments that will be in excess of the 1000000 limitation the compensation committee believes that it needs to balance the benefits of designing awards that are taxdeductible with the need to design awards that attract retain and reward executives responsible for the success of the company

compensation committee interlocks and insider participation 

prior to the completion of the reorganization joseph w saunders our chairman and chief executive officer served as our sole director and participated in deliberations concerning executive compensation currently none of the members of the compensation committee whose names appear under “ —report of the compensation committee ” which was constituted after the completion of the reorganization is or has ever been one of our officers or employees none of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee 

  

executive compensation and director compensation tables 

summary compensation table 

the following table sets forth the total compensation earned for services rendered during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 by the named executive officers of visa inc 1 the current principal executive officer and principal financial officer 2 the principal financial officer prior to the completion of the reorganization and 3 the three other most highly compensated executive officers during fiscal 2007 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 this compensation was paid by visa usa visa international or inovant as applicable 

 

         

   

  grants of planbased awards 

 

        

the proportion of total compensation in fiscal 2007 consisting of salary and bonus is displayed in the following table however it is important to note that because fiscal 2007 represents a year in which three new named executive officers were hired and a number of changes in our compensation plans occurred as part of the reorganization the proportions may not be representative of our expected future compensation policies 

 

 pension benefits 

the table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to our named executive officers including the number of years of service credited to each executive under the visa retirement plan and the visa excess retirement plan determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the consolidated financial statements of the applicable visa entity 

 

  visa retirement plan 

under the visa retirement plan our usbased employees generally earn the right to receive certain benefits upon retirement at the normal retirement age of 65 upon early retirement on or after age 55 with 10 years of service or age 50 with 10 years of service if hired prior to october 1 2002 or upon an earlier termination of employment if vested retirement benefits are calculated as the product of 125 times the years of service multiplied by the monthly final average earnings for the last 60 consecutive months before retirement or the product of 4625 times the years of service divided by 25 years multiplied by the monthly final average earnings for the 36 highest consecutive months in the last 60 months before retirement if hired prior to october 1 2002 eligible earnings include salary overtime shift differentials special and merit awards and shortterm incentive awards the formula below provides an illustration of how the retirement benefits are calculated 

  

for employees hired prior to october 1 2002 

 

 for employees hired after september 30 2002 

 

 if the employee retires early between the age of 55 and 64 or the age of 50 and 61 if hired prior to october 1 2002 and has completed at least 10 years of service the amount of benefits is reduced for each complete year an employee begins receiving early retirement benefits before the age of 65 or the age of 62 if hired prior to october 1 2002 if the employee retires prior to becoming eligible for early or normal retirement the amount of benefits is actuarially reduced and is generally not as large as if the employee had continued employment until his or her early or normal retirement date 

the visa retirement plan will begin transitioning to cash balance benefits effective january 1 2008 under the cash balance benefit accrual formula 6 of an employee’s eligible monthly pay will be credited each month to the employee’s notional cash balance account along with interest each month on the account balance at an annualized rate equal to the 30 year us treasury bond average annual interest rate for november of the previous calendar year 

the change to a cash balance benefit formula will take effect immediately for employees hired or rehired after december 31 2007 however for employees hired before january 1 2008 and not rehired thereafter the current visa retirement plan benefit formula will be grandfathered for a threeyear period and grandfathered employees will continue to accrue benefits under their current visa retirement plan benefit formula described above their accrued benefits at december 31 2010 the last day of the grandfathered period or the date they terminate employment if earlier will be preserved after that date employees will not accrue any additional benefits under the current visa retirement plan benefit formulas and all future benefit accruals will be under the cash balance benefit formula 

currently accrued benefits under the visa retirement plan become 100 vested and nonforfeitable after three years of service 

visa excess retirement plan 

to the extent that an employee’s annual retirement income benefit under the plan exceeds the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code such excess benefit is paid from visa’s nonqualified unfunded noncontributory visa excess retirement plan the vesting provisions of and formula used to calculate the benefit payable pursuant to the visa excess retirement plan are generally the same as those of the visa retirement plan described above in which benefits are calculated without regard to the internal revenue code taxqualified plan limits and then offset for benefits paid under the qualified plan 

  

nonqualified deferred compensation 

pursuant to the visa deferred compensation plan eligible usbased employees including our executive officers may defer all or a portion of their annual or longterm cash incentive award or signon bonus in addition we have an excess thrift plan which is a nonqualified noncontributory retirement savings plan for employees who exceed the internal revenue code limits under the thrift plan in which we continue to provide the matching contribution 

 

     the table below shows the funds available under the visa deferred compensation plan and the excess thrift plan and their annual rate of return for fiscal 2007 as reported by the administrator of the plan 

 

       

visa deferred compensation plan 

under the terms of the visa deferred compensation plan participants are able to defer up to 100 of their incentives or signing bonuses if they submit a qualified deferral election benefits under the visa deferred compensation plan will be paid based on one of three distribution dates or events previously elected by the participant a immediately upon or up to five years following retirement b immediately upon or the january following termination or c optionally in january in a specific year while actively employed however upon a showing of financial hardship and receipt of approval from the plan administrators an executive officer may be allowed to access funds in his deferred compensation account earlier than his existing distribution elections benefits can be received either as a lump sum payment or in annual installments except in the case of preretirement termination in which case the participant must receive the benefit in a lump sum participants are always fully vested in their deferrals under the visa deferred compensation plan upon termination of the visa deferred compensation plan within 12 months of our “change of control” participants’ benefits under the visa deferred compensation plan will be paid immediately in a lump sum the reorganization was not considered a change of control under the visa deferred compensation plan 

visa thrift plan and visa excess thrift plan 

the visa thrift plan is a taxqualified 401k retirement savings plan pursuant to which all us employees of visa are able to contribute the lesser of up to 50 or 13 for highly compensated employees of their covered pay base salary plus onehalf of any sales commissions up to the limit prescribed by the internal revenue service to the visa thrift plan on a pretax basis employees also have the option of contribution on an aftertax basis from 1 up to 50 or 13 for highly compensated employees of salary or a combination of pretax and after tax contributions that do not exceed 50 or 13 for highly compensated employees of salary and internal revenue code limits the maximum pretax amount an employee may contribute to the visa thrift plan annually is restricted by the internal revenue code if an employee reaches this limit during the calendar year an employee may continue to make contributions to the visa thrift plan on an aftertax basis 

we will match 200 of the first 3 of pay that is contributed to the visa thrift plan or 300 of the first 3 of pay if the employee has at least 10 years of service with visa all employee contributions to the visa thrift plan are fully vested upon contribution and the matching contributions vest incrementally over three years 20 after one year 40 after two years and 100 after three years 

because the internal revenue code limits the maximum amount a company and an employee can contribute to an employee’s thrift plan account each year we continue to provide the matching contribution after the applicable internal revenue code limits are reached to the visa excess thrift plan which is a nonqualified noncontributory retirement savings plan employees are eligible to participate in the visa excess thrift plan if their covered pay is greater than the internal revenue code pay cap or if the total of their contributions and visa usa or inovant’s matching contributions to the visa thrift plan exceed the internal revenue code benefit limit the features of the visa excess thrift plan are generally the same as under the visa thrift plan except benefits cannot be rolled over to an ira or another employer’s qualified plan 

employment arrangements 

set forth below is a description of the employment arrangements that currently exist between us and each of our named executive officers these historic arrangements vary among the executives based on the individual agreement with the visa entity with which each named executive officer was historically employed and in the case of mr saunders based on the circumstances under which he transitioned into his position as chairman and chief executive officer as described below it is our current intention that in connection with our proposed initial public offering and subject to the discretion of our board new employment agreements will be entered into with each of the named executive officers with the goal that the new agreements will have longer terms and be more internally consistent these new agreements are generally expected to provide for at least a threeyear employment period commencing immediately prior to the completion of this offering and to have such other terms as are customarily included in employment agreements including severance provisions

     our reorganization 

we completed a reorganization in october 2007 prior to our reorganization visa operated as five corporate entities related by ownership and membership visa usa visa international comprising the operating regions of asia pacific ap latin america and caribbean lac and central and eastern europe middle east and africa cemea visa canada visa europe and inovant which operated the visanet transaction processing system and other related processing systems each of visa usa visa canada visa europe visa ap visa lac and visa cemea operated as a separate geographic region serving its member financial institutions and administering visa programs in its respective region 

in order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance visa’s ability to compete visa undertook a reorganization in which visa usa visa international visa canada and inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of visa inc a delaware stock corporation visa europe did not become a subsidiary of visa inc but rather remained owned by its member financial institutions and entered into a set of contractual arrangements with visa inc in connection with the reorganization in the reorganization we issued different classes and series of shares reflecting the different rights and obligations of visa financial institution members and visa europe based on the geographic region in which they are located 

we believe that the reorganization provides us with several significant strategic benefits it allows us to increase our operational efficiency and enhances our ability to deliver more innovative products and services to 

  

financial institutions merchants and cardholders on a global basis the reorganization allows us to centralize and streamline our strategy and decision making we also believe that the reorganization and our proposed initial public offering will enable us to facilitate a common global approach where appropriate to the legal regulatory and competitive issues arising in today’s marketplace at the same time we believe that the reorganization preserves and reinforces the advantages that have made visa the largest retail electronic payments network in the world 

industry overview 

the global payments industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which is undergoing a major shift from paperbased payments such as cash and checks to cardbased and other electronic payments for more than 30 years visa has played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers businesses governments and merchants we believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience security enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms we also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency control and security and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience 

the global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer including 

 

  

  

   

we believe that the shift to electronic payment forms is a worldwide phenomenon however in many developing countries it is at an early stage and will be accelerated by rising incomes globalization of commerce and increased travel recent innovations such as contactless cards and mobile payments are also increasing the attractiveness of electronic payments we believe these trends create a substantial growth opportunity for the global payments industry according to the nilson report global card purchase transactions grew at a cagr of 14 over the period from 2000 to 2006 the nilson report forecasts global card purchase transactions to increase at a cagr of 11 from 2006 to 2012 with particularly strong growth in asiapacific latin america and the middle eastafrica

the most common cardbased forms of payment are generalpurpose cards which are payment cards that permit widespread usage general purpose cards are typically categorized as 

 

  

  

 the primary global general purpose card brands include visa mastercard american express discover jcb and diners club while these brands—including visa—were historically associated primarily with credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets visa and others have over time broadened their offerings to include debit atm prepaid and commercial cards 

in addition to general purpose cards a number of retailers and other entities issue limitedpurpose credit charge and prepaid cards that can be used for payment only at the issuing entity these cards are generally referred to as private label cards private label cards are sometimes issued by a financial institution under a contractual agreement with the retailer 

  

openloop versus closedloop payments networks 

general purpose and limitedpurpose payments networks primarily operate under two different business models openloop payments networks such as visa and mastercard are multiparty and operate through a system that connects two financial institutions—one that issues the card to the cardholder known as the issuing financial institution or issuer and one that has the banking relationship with the merchant known as the acquiring financial institution or acquirer—and manages information and the flow of value between them in a typical closedloop payments network the payment services are provided directly to merchants and cardholders by the owner of the network without involving thirdparty financial institution intermediaries closedloop networks can range in size from networks such as american express and discover which issue cards directly to consumers and serve merchants directly to an individual merchant that issues limitedpurpose privatelabel credit cards to its customers for use only in that merchant’s stores in recent years the major closedloop networks have begun to develop relationships with financial institution issuers and acquirers thereby emulating certain aspects of the openloop networks 

operators of openloop networks such as visa generally do not issue cards set fees or determine interest rates that cardholders are charged for use of their cards issuers have the responsibility for determining these and many other card features in addition such networks generally do not solicit merchants directly or establish the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance including the merchant discount rate both of these functions are generally the responsibility of acquirers the following table outlines the major functions of each of the three major participants in the payments network 

 

   

  largest operators of openloop and closedloop retail electronic payments networks

 our primary operations 

there are three core aspects of our business operations transaction processing services product platforms and payments network management 

transaction processing services 

core processing services 

our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between visa issuers which are the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders and acquirers which are the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants in addition we offer a range of valueadded processing services to support our customers’ visa programs and to promote the growth and security of the visa payments network 

  

authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholder’s account the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies settlement is the process of calculating determining reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared 

visa transactions can be authorized cleared and settled either as dualmessage transactions or as singlemessage transactions the choice of processing method may vary depending upon the issuer the type of card or the region in which the transaction takes place 

 

  

 authorization 

a typical visa transaction begins when the cardholder presents his or her visa card to a merchant as payment for goods or services the transaction information is then transmitted electronically to the issuer for authorization in certain cases we may authorize the transaction on behalf of the issuer through a service known as standin processing based on parameters established by the issuer the following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction authorized through our network in a typical visa transaction the authorization process by visa occurs in approximately one second 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

clearing and settlement 

clearing occurs at the time of the authorization for singlemessage transactions or in a single daily batch message containing all transactions reported by the acquirer for dualmessage transactions settlement occurs on each business day and is conducted on a net basis for all transactions submitted during the previous settlement cycle the following diagram illustrates the clearing and settlement process between the issuer and acquirer for a typical transaction processed through our system 

clearing 

 

  

  

 settlement 

 

  

 the issuer and acquirer involved in a typical visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor for example the acquirer credits the merchant’s account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer in addition the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment in the case of a credit or deferred debit card or collects payment directly from the cardholder’s deposit account in the case of a debit card 

we process virtually all transactions within the united states as well as all crossborder transactions involving products carrying our brands outside of the united states and certain other countries we do not process the majority of the domestic transactions ie transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in the same country on products carrying our brands such transactions are generally processed by governmentcontrolled payments networks our financial institution customers independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our financial institution customers 

we perform clearing and settlement through our visanet system for transactions involving an issuer that is located in visa europe’s region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world or vice versa in addition we currently provide clearing and settlement services for visa transactions occurring entirely within visa europe’s region and will continue to provide such services until completion of deployment of visa europe’s own processing system visa europe authorizes transactions for its members through its own processing system 

  

other valueadded processing services 

the size of our network and our processing capabilities allow us to offer a range of other valueadded services in certain countries these services include risk management debit issuer processing loyalty services dispute management and valueadded information services 

risk management services  our centralized and integrated network architecture allows us to monitor on a realtime basis all transactions that we process for authorization as a result we provide customers in certain countries with a number of valueadded riskmanagement services which complement our core authorization services our risk management services provide preventive monitoring investigative and predictive tools which are intended to mitigate and help eliminate fraud at the cardholder and merchant level for example visa advanced authorization which we introduced in 2005 enables us to monitor and evaluate visanet authorization requests in realtime and deliver enhanced transaction risk scores to issuers as part of the authorization message it is the first system of its kind to deliver risk indicators in realtime by assessing transaction data on both an account level and a transaction level 

debit issuer processing services visa debit processing services provides comprehensive processing services for participating united states issuers of visa debit prepaid and atm payment products in addition to core issuer authorization processing visa debit processing services offers card management services exception processing pin and atm network gateways call center services fraud detection services and atm terminal driving visa debit processing services processes more visa transactions than any other issuer processor in the world 

loyalty services  we offer loyalty services that allow our customers to enhance the attractiveness of their visa payment programs and to strengthen their relationships with cardholders and merchants these services are designed to allow our customers to differentiate their visa program offerings to support increased card usage and to increase the importance of visa payments to merchants 

visa extras is a service that participating issuers may offer to their cardholders to increase card usage enhance the value of their visa programs and create stronger cardholder relationships visa extras is a pointsbased program that rewards cardholders for using their enrolled visa cards to make qualifying purchases cardholders can redeem points for rewards in the visa extras rewards catalog for everyday items such as movie tickets retail gift certificates merchandise travel certificates dining and other rewards 

the visa incentive network enables merchants and financial institution customers to deliver tailored merchant offers to targeted groups of cardholders visa incentive network offers benefits traditionally associated with a closedloop system visa incentive network was launched in april 2005 and allows us to deliver merchant promotions to affluent and highspending visa cardholders on behalf of participating issuers based on merchantspecific cardholder spending and location criteria for each promotion we can analyze the spending patterns of visa credit card holders in the united states about which information is provided to us by participating card issuers we then deliver the promotion to the appropriate cardholders on behalf of these issuers in order to protect cardholder privacy the merchant does not gain access to cardholder information or underlying transaction data the visa incentive network database contains more than 80 million accounts visa incentive network is enabled through account level processing which allows transactions to be processed and afforded customized treatment at the account level—ie by identifying each transaction by the entire 16digit account number—rather than by the sixdigit bank identification number or bin as is the more typical industry practice we are able to implement account level processing as a result of our reengineered visa integrated payment platform as described below 

dispute management services  we manage visa resolve online an automated webbased service that allows our customers’ backoffice analysts and customer service representatives to manage and resolve visa transaction disputes more efficiently than with previous paperbased processes transaction disputes between issuers and acquirers sometimes arise from suspected fraud merchant nonfulfillment of transaction requirements 

  

or other events visa resolve online which is mandatory for all visa customers provides realtime access to visa transaction data electronic transfer of substantiating documents and automated management of communications between issuers and acquirers 

valueadded information services  we provide our customers with a range of additional informationbased business analytics and applications as well as the transaction data and associated infrastructure required to support them through these services we support and enhance our customers’ business intelligence capabilities loyalty applications operational and management performance metrics transaction research and commercial card reporting 

processing infrastructure 

we own and operate visanet our secure centralized global processing platform which consists of three synchronized processing centers in addition visa europe operates one processing center in the united kingdom which is part of our synchronized system in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement in addition we are building a new data center on the east coast of the united states these centers are linked by a global telecommunications network which is engineered for redundancy intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and valueadded services 

in september 2006 we completed a fiveyear reengineering program in which we among other things consolidated the authorization functions for our credit debit prepaid and atm transactions into one technology platform called visa integrated payment or vip vip is a modular processing platform which is flexible and secure and combines global reach with the processing power to support our future growth and product innovation 

the following is a summary of critical attributes of our processing infrastructure 

centralized architecture unlike the processing platforms of some of our primary competitors visanet is built on a centralized architecture rather than a distributed architecture as a result we are able to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in realtime and can provide valueadded information such as risk scoring or loyalty applications to the issuer while the transaction data is being routed through our system 

redundancy our global telecommunications network and processing centers are designed for redundancy and failover our newest processing center houses multiple authorization engines each supported by redundant power and telecommunications circuits this new architecture complements our multiple processing center architecture provides improved failover technology and helps to ensure that our visanet system is always available and has enough processing power to meet the growing demand for electronic payments 

modular architecture in the vip reengineering project that we completed in september 2006 we replaced a complex web of legacy code with a streamlined layered modular architecture we believe that this new architecture significantly reduces the time complexity and cost involved in adding functions or modifying the system to support emerging forms of payments such as contactless and mobile payments we also believe that this streamlined architecture was instrumental in our ability to implement account level processing on our systems in less than 12 months 

processing scale  during fiscal 2007 we processed more than 78 billion authorization clearing and settlement requests based on tests that we conducted with ibm in july 2005 we estimate that visanet is capable of processing more than 12000 transaction messages per second we believe that the scale of our processing network provides us with a significant cost advantage over our competitors 

  

product platforms 

we offer a broad range of product platforms to enable our customers to build differentiated competitive payment programs for their consumer business government and merchant clients our principal payment platforms enable credit charge deferred debit debit and prepaid payments as well as cash access for consumers businesses and government entities our payment platforms are offered under our visa visa electron interlink and plus brands 

consumer credit 

our consumer credit product platforms allow our issuers to offer deferred payment and financing products that can be customized to meet the needs of all consumer segments our baseline consumer credit platform is marketed to our issuers as visa traditional in the united states and visa classic in the rest of the world we require issuers offering credit products based on this platform to meet minimum requirements for product functionality and to offer certain services such as a reporting service for lost or stolen cards 

in addition we offer premium credit platforms which enable our issuers to tailor programs to consumers requiring higher credit lines or enhanced benefits such as loyalty programs our premium consumer credit platforms are marketed to issuers and in some cases to cardholders as visa gold visa platinum visa signature and visa infinite issuers offering these credit products are required to provide certain functionality and enhanced cardholder services that may vary by product and region for example we require that issuers provide a minimum level of cardholder rewards value and that they not impose a preset spending limit on visa signature cards 

we provide a number of additional services that many issuers choose to offer in conjunction with their visa credit programs even where we do not require the inclusion of such services certain of these services such as emergency card replacement travel assistance services and rental car insurance are provided by third parties under contract with us 

consumer deposit access 

our deposit access product platforms enable our issuers to offer consumer payment and cash access products that draw upon consumer deposit accounts such as checking demand deposit asset or other prefunded accounts for the 12 months ended june 30 2007 consumer debit and cash access products accounted for the majority of visa transactions worldwide 

consumer debit 

visa debit  our primary consumer debit platform uses the visa brand mark through our rules and product platform requirements we further segment our visa debit product platform into visa classic visa gold visa platinum and visa infinite which allows our issuers to customize their visa debit programs and offer a range of benefits to their debit cardholders 

interlink debit  we provide the interlink debit product platform in the united states and certain countries in the ap region interlink is a singlemessage pointofsale debit network it generally requires a cardholder to enter a personal identification number or pin for authentication interlink allows our issuers to provide a full range of debit card offerings to their deposit account customers interlink acceptance marks may be included on visa debit cards or issued as standalone debit cards 

visa electron debit  visa electron is a payment product platform that permits issuers to require all transactions initiated from the card to be authorized electronically it is primarily used by issuers offering payment programs to higher risk customer segments or in countries where electronic authorization is less 

  

prevalent such as certain markets in the ap lac and cemea regions visa electron is primarily issued as a consumer debit product but visa electron can also be issued as a credit or prepaid product for consumers or businesses 

pos check service  the visa pos check service enables merchants to convert the account information on a consumer’s check into an electronic visa transaction message at the point of sale if the check is drawn on a demand deposit account held at a participating visa customer this service which is currently offered only in the united states reduces the cost and time involved in merchant and financial institution processing of checks by taking advantage of visa’s efficient electronic payments processing 

cash access 

our customers can provide global cash access to their cardholders by issuing products accepted at visa and plus branded atms most visa and visa electron branded cards offer customers cash access at atms as well as at branches of our participating financial institution customers the plus brand may also be included on issuers’ nonvisa branded cards to offer international cash access as a complement to domestic cash access services we believe that more than one million visa and plus branded atms are available in more than 170 countries payment cards may contain multiple cash access brand marks in addition to visa and plus and transactions involving visa and plus branded cards will generally be processed through our systems only if there is no regional or domestic atm brand that is capable of processing the transaction 

prepaid 

our prepaid product platform enables issuers to offer products that access a designated pool of funds allowing cardholders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks our prepaid platform includes gift travel youth payroll money transfer voucher replacement corporate incentive insurance reimbursement and government benefits cards our prepaid platforms are also used to pay highway tolls and to top up prepaid mobile phones in some regions prepaid products can be issued as either reloadable or disposable reloadable cards enable consumers or third parties such as employers to add additional funds to the pool consumers may reload cards through various channels including merchants and participating financial institution customers disposable cards cannot be reloaded in this manner our prepaid cards can be distributed through a number of channels including financial institution branches internet sites merchants and employers 

commercial 

our commercial product platforms enable multinational large medium and small companies and government organizations to streamline payment processes manage information and their supply chain and reduce administrative costs our commercial platforms include visa business credit visa business check card visa business debit visa signature business visa business electron visa corporate visa purchasing visa fleet visa distribution visa commercial one card and visa commerce 

large and medium companies and government organizations  the visa corporate product platform offers payment options for travel and entertainment charges including cash advances and provides detailed transaction data which allows companies to track policy compliance and supplier management visa purchasing provides corporate clients with a payment product to easily acquire the goods and services needed to conduct their business by streamlining time and paperintensive purchase order and invoice processing and by providing flexible transaction authorization and verification statements for each cardholder a subproduct of visa purchasing visa fleet provides specialized authorization controls that fleet operators need to monitor and manage spending for companyprovided vehicles visa distribution provides an accounts receivable service for suppliers with dispersed operations the visa commercial one card allows organizations to combine procurement travel and entertainment and fleet functionality into a single payment solution visa commerce is a businesstobusiness electronic platform providing accounts payable and accounts receivable payment services to facilitate large transactions between contracted buyers and sellers 

  

small businesses  the visa business credit and debit platforms provide small businesses with cash flow tools purchasing savings rewards and management reporting visa business electron is an electronic authorization platform used in many countries outside north america and has authorization controls that are similar to those of the consumer visa electron products described above 

core to all visa commercial payment platforms are information management reconciliation and reporting which integrate payment data into company financial systems visa information management is a webbased tool that provides access to a suite of reporting and information tools in multiple languages to companies using any of the visa commercial platforms 

product platform innovation 

we invest in the development and enhancement of payment product platforms with the goal of increasing the migration of consumer and business spending to electronic payments we believe that innovation results in more secure and versatile payment program options for customers merchants and consumers we focus on new payment channels card technologies payment account access devices and authentication methods and have recently made significant investments in the development of contactless payment cards and devices mobile payments chip cards magnetic stripe and unembossed card enhancements and money transfer 

contactless payment cards and devices  we support customer issuance and merchant acceptance of emvcompliant contactless payment cards and devices including contactlessenabled cards minicards and microtags a contactless device contains a computer chip that securely stores account information and transmits it to merchant terminals via secure radiofrequency technology that operates over short distances contactless devices can increase speed and convenience at the point of sale by allowing a consumer to complete a transaction without the need to swipe a card manually or insert it into a pointofsale device we believe that contactless technology is particularly appealing to merchants in segments with high pointofsale throughput and a large proportion of smallvalue transactions 

mobile payments  we support payment origination and acceptance by mobile devices such as mobile telephones and wireless data devices in 2007 we introduced the visa mobile platform a global initiative that provides a comprehensive suite of technology tools and applications designed to promote product development and commercialization of mobile payment services the visa mobile platform is designed to provide consumers with a consistent experience for all types of payments regardless of phone type or geography and is designed to work within the existing infrastructure established by mobile carriers and financial institutions in addition to supporting the development of mobile payment solutions such as contactless payments mobile internet payments and persontoperson payment the platform also supports the development of paymentrelated services such as account management services to enable consumers to monitor account activity through a mobile device and mobile coupons that can be redeemed at the point of sale 

chip cards  in certain regions and countries we support customer issuance of visa and visa electron chip cards which are compliant with the emv integrated circuit card specifications for payment systems in addition to a traditional magnetic stripe chip cards carry encrypted account data on an embedded computer chip that is read by a pointofsale terminal chip cards can offer increased data security over traditional magneticstripeonly cards and can reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud 

magnetic stripe and unembossed card enhancements beginning in october 2003 we introduced a series of rules and standards that allow our customers in certain regions to issue magneticstripe visa cards with enhanced authorization requirements and risk controls that increase their ability to offer visa cards to highrisk consumer segments these standards include codes on the magnetic stripe that instruct pointofsale terminals to request realtime transaction authorizations from the card issuer providing an increased level of control over transaction authorization as compared to magneticstripe cards that lack such codes these standards also permit issuers in certain countries to issue magnetic stripe visa cards with the cardholder name and account number 

  

printed on the card rather than embossed with raised lettering these unembossed cards reduce the risk of fraudulent card use at merchants that do not have electronic point of sale terminals that are capable of seeking transaction authorizations from the card issuer 

money transfer  visa money transfer is a remittance platform that our customers use to allow their cardholders to send funds to other visa cardholders with accounts at participating financial institutions the funds are credited directly to the individual’s visa credit debit or prepaid account our customers can deploy our standard visa money transfer service which includes sophisticated antimoney laundering fraud and risk controls or they can develop their own customized services our customers also offer domestic and crossborder money transfer services using visa prepaid cards in lac cemea and ap regions 

payments network management 

we devote significant resources to ensure that visa is the payments network of choice for customers merchants and cardholders we seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities increasing acceptance of visabranded cards around the world and ensuring that the system operates in a reliable and secure manner for all of our network participants 

brand management and promotion 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand our integrated approach to brand management and promotion combines advertising sponsorships promotions and public relations to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand promote product usage increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention for merchants we work to ensure that the visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment as well as a way to increase their business profitably for our customers our marketing is designed to support their card issuance activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands for cardholders we work to ensure that visa is a symbol of security convenience and acceptance by emphasizing these core attributes of our brand we aim to reinforce the recognition that visa is “the world’s best way to pay” 

advertising plays a critical role in building brand awareness and equity as well as communicating the benefits of our brand and visabranded payment products through our advertising campaigns we strive to provide a consistent recognizable and compelling message that supports our brand positioning during 2006 we launched our “life takes visa” brand campaign in the united states reinforcing our brand promise to deliver innovative products and services that empower our cardholders to experience life and business their way and on their terms in other regions we promote these same brand messages through tailored regional and countryspecific advertising campaigns such as our “all it takes” campaign in ap and our “porque la vida es ahora” campaign in lac 

we establish global marketing relationships to promote the visa brand and to allow customers to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events through these marketing relationships our customers may develop marketing programs that include the visa brand and mention our sponsorship status in addition we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities around other national and local events or with associations and companies to provide customized marketing platforms to customers in certain countries and regions 

our customer and business partner marketing consulting services provide customized advice and support to improve our customers’ cardholder acquisition cardholder retention and product usage efforts we conduct strategic reviews of our customers’ marketing activities and portfolio management practices help them develop acquisition and retention programs develop marketing for new products conduct market segmentation analysis and perform other consultative services in addition to customized consulting projects we offer training to provide our customers with an understanding of best practices for managing their payments business 

  

we also provide marketing support to our customers through our support of visa cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the brand marks of an issuer and a marketing partner usually a merchant while affinity cards generally bear the marks or logos of charitable professional educational or civic organizations 

our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments these programs which we develop in conjunction with merchants generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

merchants play a vital role in our payments network and we work continuously to build our merchant acceptance and enhance our relationships with merchants that accept visabranded cards at june 30 2007 our customers reported that our cards were accepted at more than 28 million merchant outlets around the world 

we aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fastgrowing segments such as bill payment our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations delivering valueadded information services such as the visa incentive network and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment in the united states for example the visa small ticket payment service provides a special interchange rate category and no signature required programs eliminate the requirement for a cardholder signature for certain smallvalue transactions in a number of everyday spend categories including quickservice restaurants movie theatres and public transit under this program the merchant will be protected against no signature chargebacks we believe these initiatives have resulted in a faster checkout process a reduction in merchants’ operating expenses increased merchant acceptance and greater transaction volume in these categories 

we enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our cards 

we continue to respond to the needs of merchants in order to enhance the efficiency of the visa payments network for the benefit of all network participants for example in 2006 we enabled merchants in the united states to obtain copies of key provisions of our us operating regulations thereby increasing access to the rules and procedures that govern merchant participation in our system we also published our us interchange rate schedule and made our us interchange rate qualification guide available to merchants in an effort to educate merchants about the structure of our customer interchange rates and the criteria that determine the specific rate for which a given transaction qualifies 

customer standards 

our financial institution customers participate in the visa payments network through one of two ways financial institution customers that were members of either visa usa or visa international prior to the closing of our reorganization have remained members of those two entities which continue to operate as nonstock subsidiaries of visa inc those financial institutions have nonequity membership interests in the applicable subsidiary which represent the commercial and other rights and obligations with regard to participation in the visa payments system our financial institution customers that were members of visa canada prior to the closing of our reorganization have entered into a series of agreements which govern their commercial rights and obligations with respect to the visa payments system 

  

our customers are generally required to be financial institutions or other deposittaking institutions organized under local banking laws or whollyowned by such institutions certain of our customers participate in the full range of functions such as soliciting cardholders and issuing cards soliciting and signing merchants and acquiring merchant transactions these financial institutions may also sponsor other financial institutions for more limited participation in our network 

rulemaking and enforcement 

in general our customers are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems our customers are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with and in certain cases nonequity membership interests in our subsidiaries these rules and standards govern their use of our branded programs and their participation in our transaction processing system variations on such rules and standards may exist throughout the world in order to meet the needs of specific geographies we require our customers to comply with these rules which relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks the standards design and features of payment cards and programs merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants use of agents disputes between members risk management guaranteed settlement customer financial failures and allocation of losses among customers 

we establish dispute management procedures between customers relating to specific transactions for example after a transaction is presented to an issuer the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons including fraud if the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction the issuer may return or charge back the transaction to the acquirer we enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes 

credit risk management 

we indemnify our customers for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of a customer to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we indemnify customers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system no material loss related to settlement risk has been incurred in recent years 

to manage our exposure in the event our customers fail to fund their settlement obligations we have a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures customers with significant settlement exposure are evaluated regularly to assess risk in certain instances we may require a customer to post collateral or provide other guarantees if a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss we may also apply other risk control measures such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions limiting the use of certain types of agents prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain high risk merchants or suspending or terminating a customer’s rights to participate in our payments network the exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model key inputs to the model include the probability of customers becoming insolvent statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience and estimated settlement exposures at period end 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder or account data including systems operated by merchants financial institutions and other thirdparty data processors fraud is also more likely to occur in association with transactions where the card is not present at the point of sale such as electronic commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants that engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt is generally unavailable 

  

our fraud detection and prevention offerings include verified by visa a global internet authentication product which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code visa advanced authorization which adds additional fraud detection capability by adding realtime risk scores to authorization messages and chip and pin programs that have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud at physical point of sale locations we have also implemented rules that require the use of more secure pin encryption standards for atms and pointofsale pin entry devices installed after 2002 and 2003 and we have recently mandated that all pins transmitted through visanet to the issuer be encrypted using the triple des or data encryption standard by july 1 2010 

in a 2006 cooperative industry effort we cofounded the payment card industry pci data security standards council an independent council that established security standards to protect cardholder data and to prevent fraud in late 2006 we introduced a pci compliance program with both incentives and fines targeted at our largest acquirers in order to improve compliance with the pci standards by our largest usbased merchants which we refer to as level i and level ii merchants the initiative’s goal is to eradicate the storage of prohibited account data such as magnetic stripe also known as track data cvv2 the threedigit security code on the back of the card and pin data and to improve pci compliance among this group of merchants at september 30 2007 99 of level i and level ii merchants had confirmed that they were not storing prohibited account data and approximately twothirds of the level i merchants and almost 45 of the level ii merchants had certified their compliance with the pci standards 

in 2006 we began upgrading all connections to visanet with encryption capabilities to protect data that is transferred to and from visanet and began performing data content analysis to ensure proper data safekeeping and purging of obsolete data in 2006 we also began developing a webbased tool that will replace our legacy riskidentification system to better assist customers in their identification and monitoring of highrisk relationships 

interchange 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange fees are typically paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system we set default interchange rates in the united states and other regions in certain jurisdictions interchange rates are subject to government regulation although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange fees interchange fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards we believe that interchange fees are an important driver of system volume 

we believe the default interchange rates that we use promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by eliminating the need for each of our customers to negotiate transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and ultimately consumers and merchants we believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers merchants our customers and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment and creating incentives for innovation enhanced data quality and security 

interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of jurisdictions including the united states european union australia brazil colombia germany honduras hungary mexico new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom in certain countries such as 

  

australia and mexico interchange rates have been adjusted in advance of or in response to government regulation we are currently devoting substantial management and financial resources to explain the importance of and defend interchange fees and other legal and regulatory challenges we face relating to interchange fees see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—global interchange proceedings ” and item 1a—“ risk factors—interchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business ” 

merchant discount rates  acquirers generally charge merchants a fee for each transaction called a “merchant discount” this fee would typically cover costs they incur for participation in fourparty payments networks including those relating to interchange and compensate them for various other services they provide to merchants merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant customers and are established in competition with other acquirers other payment card systems and other forms of payment we do not establish or regulate merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

we own a number of valuable trademarks and designs which are essential to our business including visa interlink plus visa electron the “winged v” design the “dove” design and the “bands design—blue white  gold” design we also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands products programs and services through agreements with our customers we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network 

in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment including paperbased forms principally cash and checks cardbased payments including credit charge debit atm prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and other electronic payments including wire transfers electronic benefits transfers ach payments and electronic data interchange 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and intense competition worldwide the leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are visa mastercard american express and diners club other general purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in ap and discover in the united states in certain countries our competitors have leading positions such as jcb in japan and china unionpay in china which is the sole domestic payment processor and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china due to local regulation we also compete against privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or other merchant 

in the debit card market segment visa and mastercard are the primary global brands in addition our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands such as star owned by first data corporation pulse owned by discover nyce owned by metavante corporation and others in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by 

  

mastercard and many of the online debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands are the primary brands and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume 

some of our major competitors including american express and discover operate closedloop systems closedloop systems can benefit from direct access to consumer and merchant information and they tend to have greater control over cardholder service than do operators of openloop payments networks like visa which depend on their financial institution customers to provide products and services directly to the cardholder in recent years the major closedloop systems american express and discover have begun working directly with issuing and acquiring financial institutions thus emulating certain aspects of the openloop system including setting transfer pricing 

in addition we compete against companies that are developing and implementing alternative payments networks among other things these competitors provide internet currencies which can be used to buy and sell goods online virtual checking programs which permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for both online and pointofsale transactions and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do in mobile commerce we also face competition from established network operators that may be in a position to enable mobile devices to process electronic payments or transfer money and to use their existing billing systems to process these payments and transfers between their customers and third parties without our involvement 

our visa debit processing service is the largest provider of issuer processing services for united states issuers of visa debit prepaid and atm products and thus also competes with third party processors such as first data corporation and tsys 

we believe that the primary factors affecting our competitive position in the payments industry include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry for example as a result of the june 2003 settlement of a us merchant lawsuit against visa usa and mastercard merchants may choose not to accept usissued visa debit cards in the united states while still accepting visabranded credit cards and vice versa in addition following the final judgment in our doj litigation members of visa usa may issue certain payment cards that compete with visabranded cards such as american express or discover while remaining visa members since this final judgment several members of visa usa including but not limited to bank of america citibank hsbcmetris usaa barclaycard us ge consumer finance inc first bank  trust central national bank  trust and brenham national bank have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards outside of the united states our customers have historically been permitted to issue american express cards as well as the cards of other competing general purpose card networks 

  

the banking industry has undergone consolidation and we expect this trend to continue a major financial institution customer may be acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business because continued consolidation in the banking industry results in fewer financial institutions of increased size the bargaining power of the remaining financial institutions increases 

government regulation 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to government regulation of the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used our customers are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence our business is affected by such regulations in recent years our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny in particular interchange fees associated with openloop payments systems such as ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions in which our cards are used 

as the volume of cardbased payments has increased in recent years interchange fees including our default interchange rates have become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a similar approach to interchange fees and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions interchange fees have been the topic of recent committee hearings in the us house of representatives and the us senate as well as conferences held by a number of us federal reserve banks in addition the us house of representatives has passed a bill that would commission a study by the federal trade commission of the role of interchange fees in alleged price gouging at gas stations individual state legislatures in the united states are also reviewing interchange fees and legislators in a number of states have proposed bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction in addition the merchants payments coalition a coalition of trade associations representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards is mounting a challenge to interchange fees in the united states by seeking legislative and regulatory intervention 

interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of jurisdictions including the united states european union australia brazil colombia germany honduras hungary mexico new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom in certain countries such as australia and mexico interchange rates have been adjusted in anticipation of or in response to government regulation 

most jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate have implemented amended or have pending antimoney laundering regulations in 2002 we and our customers became subject to the provisions of the usa patriot act which requires the creation and implementation of comprehensive antimoney laundering programs in general this requires that we make certain efforts to prevent our payments system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities including for example the designation of a compliance officer training of employees adoption of internal policies and procedures to mitigate money laundering risks and periodic audits 

we are subject to regulations imposed by ofac ofac restricts financial dealings with cuba iran myanmar and sudan as well as financial dealings with certain restricted third parties such as identified money laundering fronts for terrorists or narcotics traffickers while we prohibit financial institutions that are domiciled in those countries or are restricted parties from being visa members many visa international members are nonus financial institutions and thus are not subject to ofac restrictions accordingly our payments network may be used with respect to transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to ofacadministered sanctions 

  

in recent years a number of regulations relating to the price of credit and directed at our financial institution customers have been implemented in some jurisdictions in which our cards are used in the united states regulators and the us congress have increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing and underwriting standards relating to credit for example a number of regulations have been issued to implement the us fair and accurate credit transactions act and other regulations are expected to be issued in 2007 one such regulation pertaining to riskbased pricing could have a significant impact on the application process for credit cards and result in increased costs of issuance andor a decrease in the flexibility of card issuers to set the price of credit another such regulation is a significant proposal to amend regulation z which implements the truthinlending act and will change the substance and format of consumer disclosures made by financial institutions in addition the us senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and other committees and subcommittees may continue to consider the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit fees are determined imposed and disclosed any regulation in this regard could impact our customers’ ability to issue cards profitably in certain segments and impact our payments volume and revenues 

we and our customers are subject to regulations related to privacy data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business for example in the united states our customers and we are respectively subject to the banking regulators’ information safeguard rules and the federal trade commission’s rules under the grammleachbliley act respectively these rules require that our customers and we develop implement and maintain written comprehensive information security programs containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue 

in recent years there has been a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the united states a number of bills have been introduced in congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address these issues congress is considering data securitydata breach legislation which if implemented could affect our customers and us in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies for example our customers in china are not permitted to issue cards carrying our brands for domestic use in china governments in certain other countries have considered similar restrictions from time to time 

many jurisdictions in which our customers and we operate are considering or are expected to consider legislation with regard to internet transactions and in particular with regard to choice of law the legality of certain ecommerce transactions the collection of applicable taxes and copyright and trademark infringement if implemented these initiatives could require our customers and us to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions or to take other actions for example draft regulations were proposed on october 1 2007 pursuant to recently enacted us legislation regarding internet gambling which will require our customers and us to code and block certain types of internet gambling transactions comments on these draft regulations were due december 12 2007 and final regulations will be forthcoming at an undetermined date various us regulatory agencies are also considering additional regulation covering capital requirements privacy disclosure rules security and marketing which could impact our customers and us directly increases in fraud or other illegal activity involving our cards could also lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance 

certain of our operations in the united states are periodically reviewed by the federal financial institution examination council to ensure our compliance with applicable data integrity and security requirements as well as other requirements applicable to us as a result of our role as a service provider to financial institutions in 

  

recent years the federal banking regulators in the united states have adopted a series of regulatory measures intended to require more conservative accounting greater risk management and higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders government regulators may determine that we are a systemically important payments system and impose settlement risk management requirements on us including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for customer participation and merchant access to our payments system in addition outside of the united states a number of jurisdictions have implemented legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payments systems for example regulators in australia mexico colombia india singapore and malaysia have been given statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in those countries 

see item 1a— “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in costly new compliance burdens being imposed on us and our customers and lead to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues ” “ —interchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business ” and “ —existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and revenues ” 

employees 

at september 30 2007 we employed 5479 persons worldwide we consider our relationships with our employees to be good

interchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange fees are typically paid to issuers which are the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders by acquirers which are the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system we set default interchange rates in the united states and other regions in certain jurisdictions interchange rates are subject to government regulation although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange fees interchange fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards we believe that interchange fees are an important driver of system volume 

as the volume of cardbased payments has increased in recent years interchange fees including our default interchange rates have become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a similar approach to interchange fees and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions 

  

interchange fees have been the topic of recent committee hearings in the us house of representatives and the us senate as well as conferences held by a number of us federal reserve banks in addition the us house of representatives has passed a bill that would commission a study by the federal trade commission of the role of interchange fees in alleged price gouging at gas stations individual state legislatures in the united states are also reviewing interchange fees and legislators in a number of states have proposed bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction in addition the merchants payments coalition a coalition of trade associations representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards is mounting a challenge to interchange fees in the united states by seeking legislative and regulatory intervention 

interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of other jurisdictions including the european union australia brazil colombia germany honduras hungary mexico new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom for example 

 

  

  

  

 regulatory actions such as these even if not directed at us or if affecting a geographic region in which we do not operate may nonetheless increase regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees if we cannot successfully defend our ability to set default interchange rates to maximize system volume our payments system may become unattractive to issuers andor acquirers this result could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our openloop multiparty payments system lower overall transaction volumes andor make closedloop payments systems or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also begin to charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability acquirers could elect to charge higher merchant discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer visa cardholders to alternate payment systems in addition issuers or acquirers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking incentives from us or a reduction in the fees that we charge any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

a finding of liability in the interchange litigation may result in substantial damages 

since 2005 approximately 50 class action and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against visa usa visa international mastercard and other defendants including certain visa usa member financial institutions which we refer to as the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegations the 

  

plaintiffs allege that visa usa’s and visa international’s setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws the lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york the class action complaints have been consolidated into a single amended class action complaint and the individual complaints are also being consolidated in the same multidistrict litigation a similar case filed in 2004 is on appeal by plaintiffs after having been dismissed with prejudice and has not been transferred to the multidistrict litigation 

the plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief the plaintiffs have not yet quantified the damages they seek although several of the complaints allege that the plaintiffs expect that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and visa usa andor visa international may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established which could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment the interchange litigation is part of the covered litigation which our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address however the retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements of or judgments in the interchange litigation failure to successfully defend or settle the interchange litigation would result in liability that to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent in addition even if our direct financial exposure were covered by our retrospective responsibility plan settlements or judgments involving the multidistrict litigation could include restrictions on our ability to conduct business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth see item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation—the interchange litigation ” 

a finding of liability in the discover litigation may result in substantial damages 

in 1998 the us department of justice filed suit against visa usa visa international and mastercard international in the us district court for the southern district of new york the suit alleged among other things that visa usa restrained competition by prohibiting its member financial institutions from issuing certain payment cards that compete with visabranded cards such as american express or discover which we refer to as competing payment cards the district court held that the prohibition constituted an unlawful restraint of trade under the us federal antitrust laws and this decision was affirmed by the second circuit court of appeals in 2004 the us supreme court denied our petition for certiorari thereby exhausting all avenues for further appeal in this case as a result of this judgment the visa usa bylaw that provided for the prohibition became unenforceable in october 2004 and was subsequently repealed 

discover filed suit against visa usa visa international and mastercard international alleging that prohibiting member financial institutions from issuing competing payment cards caused it injury under the us federal antitrust laws discover has requested that the district court give collateral estoppel effect to the court’s findings in the judgment of the 1998 department of justice litigation although the district court denied that request when made at the outset of the litigation the district court indicated it would entertain a motion by discover for collateral estoppel at a later time if the court were to give collateral estoppel effect to one or more issues significant elements of discover’s claims would be established making it more likely that visa usa and visa international could be found liable and that discover would be awarded damages even if the court declines to give collateral estoppel effect to any of these issues discover may nevertheless be successful in establishing these issues in subsequent proceedings on july 24 2007 discover served an expert report purporting to demonstrate that it had incurred substantial damages because this lawsuit was brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and visa usa and visa international may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established which could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment 

  

american express filed a suit similar to the discover litigation against visa usa visa international and certain visa usa member financial institutions the american express lawsuit is part of the covered litigation which our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address we visa usa and visa international entered into a settlement agreement with american express that became effective on november 9 2007 the settlement agreement in the american express litigation will be funded through our retrospective responsibility plan 

the discover lawsuit is also part of the covered litigation the retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impacts of settlements of or judgments in the discover lawsuit failure to successfully defend against or settle these lawsuits would result in liability that to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent see item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation ” 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements and judgments in the covered litigation and will not insulate us from other pending or future litigation 

our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the litigation described under item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation ” the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation including an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our proposed initial public offering and potential followon offerings of our common stock a loss sharing agreement a judgment sharing agreement and the indemnification obligation of visa usa members pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique and complex if we are prevented from using one or more of these mechanisms under our retrospective responsibility plan we could have difficulty funding the payment of a settlement or final judgment against us in a covered litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

the retrospective responsibility plan does not address litigation other than the covered litigation that we currently face including state court litigation relating to interchange and will not cover litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our proposed initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation in addition our retrospective responsibility plan is designed to cover only the potential monetary liability from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation settlements and judgments in covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business in the future which could adversely affect our revenues increase our expenses andor limit our prospects for growth therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan adequately safeguards us from the monetary impact of settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation it may not be sufficient to insulate us from all potential adverse consequences of settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation 

the retrospective responsibility plan depends in part on the timely completion of our proposed initial public offering and if we are unable to close our proposed initial public offering in a timely manner we may have insufficient funds to pay settlements of or judgments in such litigation which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

visa usa and visa international are currently involved in the litigation described under item 3 “ —legal and regulatory proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan ” plaintiffs in these litigation matters have alleged substantial damages upon the closing of our proposed initial public offering we intend to deposit a portion of the net proceeds from such offering as determined by the litigation committee in an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation will be payable we intend to use the funds in 

  

the escrow account to satisfy the settlement obligations of visa usa in the american express litigation and as described below to make payments relating to obligations of visa usa visa international and in certain instances visa inc in connection with future settlement of or judgments in covered litigation the settlement agreement for the american express litigation requires that we make an initial payment of 945 million on or before march 31 2008 and that beginning march 31 2008 we pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million each quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion it may be difficult for us to fund settlement of any of the covered litigation prior to the completion of our proposed initial public offering because we plan to use the escrow account as our primary source of funds for the payment of any potential losses arising from the covered litigation 

further visa usa visa international and visa inc have entered into a loss sharing agreement and a judgment sharing agreement in the interchange litigation which became effective on july 1 2007 with certain of their members which provide that these members will be responsible for their proportionate share of the liabilities associated with the covered litigation however the loss sharing agreement provides that if we do not timely pursue and consummate an initial public offering including having completed an initial public offering before may 28 2008 the date that is 240 days after completion of the reorganization the members’ obligations under the loss sharing agreement may be suspended until we have completed an initial public offering at which point such obligations will be reinstated in full as if they had never been suspended the 240day period may be extended under certain circumstances in addition this agreement provides that the signing banks are responsible only for a proportionate amount of the liability in respect of the covered litigation equal to their membership proportion as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation because not all of visa usa’s members have signed the loss sharing agreement until the funding of the escrow account pursuant to the retrospective responsibility plan we would also need to rely upon those members’ indemnification obligations contained in visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and as agreed in their membership agreements to recover the remaining portion of any liability from visa usa’s members 

in addition if there were a final judgment against us in connection with the covered litigation or if we were to incur a judgment sharing obligation in a covered litigation before our proposed initial public offering we would have to rely upon the loss sharing agreement which only indemnifies us for a portion of the liability with respect to the covered litigation that is equal to the aggregate membership proportion of the visa usa members that sign the loss sharing agreement as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and we would have to seek indemnification from visa usa’s remaining members pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and as agreed in their membership agreements to the extent we are unable to secure indemnification from our members any portion of such a judgment not covered by our judgment sharing agreements would have to be paid by us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

if the settlements of visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion cases are not ultimately approved and we are unsuccessful in any of the various lawsuits relating to visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

visa usa and visa international are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that their currency conversion practices are or were deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in particular a trial judge in california found that the former currency conversion practices of visa usa and visa international were deceptive under california state law and ordered visa usa and visa international to require their members to disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to credit card holders the decision was reversed on appeal on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing to pursue his claims after the trial court’s decision several putative class actions were filed in california state courts challenging visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion practices for credit and debit cards a number of putative class actions relating to visa usa’s and visa international’s former currency conversion practices were also 

  

filed in federal court the federal actions have been coordinated or consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york the consolidated complaint alleges that the former currency conversion practices of visa usa and visa international violated federal antitrust laws 

on july 20 2006 and september 14 2006 visa usa and visa international entered into agreements settling or otherwise disposing of the federal and state actions and related matters pursuant to the settlement agreements visa usa paid approximately 100 million as part of the defendants’ settlement fund for the federal actions and will pay approximately 20 million to fund settlement of the california cases the federal court has granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreements but the settlement is subject to final approval by the court and resolution of all appeals if final approval of the settlement agreements is not granted all of the agreements resolving the federal and state actions will terminate if that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against some or all of these lawsuits we may have to pay restitution andor damages and may be required to modify our currency conversion practices the potential amount of damages andor restitution could be substantial in addition although visa usa and visa international have substantially changed the practices that were at issue in these litigations if the courts require further changes to our currency conversion and crossborder transaction practices it could materially and adversely affect our business see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—currency conversion litigation ” 

if visa usa or visa international is found liable in certain other lawsuits that have been brought against them or if we are found liable in other litigation to which we may become subject in the future we may be forced to pay substantial damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

in recent years numerous civil actions and investigations have been filed or initiated against visa usa and visa international alleging or seeking information as to violations of various competition antitrust consumer protection and other laws these actions and investigations have been filed or initiated by a variety of different parties including the us department of justice state attorneys general merchants consumers competing cardissuing companies and other plaintiffs examples of such claims which are described more fully under item 3—“ legal proceedings — other legal and regulatory proceedings ” include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers due to the size and scope of our business and the large number of parties that are involved in our payment system although our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address potential monetary liabilities arising from the specific litigation described under item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation ” the plan does not cover other litigation that we currently face and will not cover litigation including state court litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our proposed initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation we cannot predict whether or to what extent we will be subject to litigation liability that is not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any of the proceedings described above or in any future proceedings we may be forced to pay substantial damages andor change our business practices or our pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies suggesting that we may be infringing a preexisting patent or that we need to license use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us holders of patents may pursue claims against us in the future if they believe their patents are being infringed by our product or service offerings based on our experience with such claims to date we do not believe that any such claims would prevent us from continuing to operate our payments system or market any of our significant core products and services in substantially the same or equivalent manner as we have to date 

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years as a result of litigation and litigation settlements for example as a result of the june 2003 settlement of a us merchant lawsuit against visa usa merchants are able to reject visa consumer debit cards in the united states while still accepting other visabranded cards and vice versa in addition following the final judgment entered in the litigation the us department of justice or doj brought against visa usa and visa international in 1998 as of october 2004 members of visa usa may issue certain competing payment cards since this final judgment several members of visa usa have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—department of justice antitrust case and related litigation ” 

in addition pursuant to a court order certain visa usa debit issuers may be able to terminate some parts of their agreements with us visa usa’s bylaws provided that a settlement service fee was to be paid by certain visa usa members that shifted a substantial portion of their offline debit card volume to another debit brand unless that shift was to the american express or discover brands in june 2007 a federal court ruled that the settlement service fee violated the final judgment entered in the case the doj brought against visa usa visa international and mastercard in 1998 see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—department of justice antitrust case and related litigation ” as a remedy the court ordered visa usa to repeal the settlement service fee bylaw further any visa usa debit issuer subject to the settlement 

  

service fee prior to its repeal that entered into an agreement with visa usa that includes offline debit issuance on or after june 20 2003 is now permitted to terminate that agreement provided that the issuer has entered into an agreement to issue mastercardbranded debit cards and has repaid to visa usa any unearned benefits or financial incentives under its visa usa agreement the settlement service fee bylaw was rescinded as of the effective date of the order but visa usa has appealed other aspects of the court’s decision including the contract termination portion of the court’s remedy see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—department of justice antitrust case and related litigation ” 

the developments discussed above and any future limitations on our business resulting from settlements of or judgments in pending or potential litigation could limit the fees we charge and reduce our payments volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

if we are partially or wholly unable to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets related to our litigation expenses incurred in connection with the covered litigation our financial results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

the fiscal 2007 statement of operations of visa usa reflects a litigation provision of 27 billion associated with the settlement of the american express litigation and management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 related to the discover litigation and other matters for tax purposes the deduction related to these matters is deferred until the payments are made and thus visa usa established a deferred tax asset of 778 million related to these payments which is net of a reserve to reflect our best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized although we believe that the estimates and judgments we made in establishing our deferred tax asset and related reserves are reasonable some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in costly new compliance burdens being imposed on us and our customers and lead to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues 

we and our customers are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years examples of such regulation include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 increased regulatory focus in connection with the matters discussed above may increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause a reduction in payments volume which could materially adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and revenues 

we and our customers are subject to regulations related to privacy and data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we could be adversely affected by these regulations for example in the united states we and our customers are subject to the banking regulators’ information safeguard rules and the federal trade commission’s rules under the grammleachbliley act the rules require that we and our customers develop implement and maintain written comprehensive information security programs containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue 

in recent years there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach in the united states a number of bills have been introduced in congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address these issues congress will likely consider data securitydata breach legislation in 2008 that if implemented could affect our customers and us in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

regulation of privacy data use and security may materially increase our costs and our customers’ costs and may decrease the number of our cards that our customers issue which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure or the failure of our customers to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions and damage to our global reputation and our brand 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular 

  

geographies for example our members in china are not permitted to issue our cards for domestic use in china governments in certain other countries have considered similar restrictions from time to time our efforts to effect change in countries where our access to the domestic payments segment is limited may not be successful which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

if government regulators determine that we are a systemically important payments system we may have to change our settlement procedures or other operations which could make it more costly to operate our business and reduce our operational flexibility 

a number of international initiatives are underway to maintain financial stability by strengthening financial infrastructure the committee on payment and settlement systems of the central banks of the group of ten countries has developed a set of core principles for “systemically important payment systems” government regulators in the united states or elsewhere may determine that we are a “systemically important payments system” and impose settlement risk management requirements on us including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system any of these developments could make it more costly to operate our business 

our framework agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities 

under our framework agreement with visa europe we are required to indemnify visa europe for losses resulting from any claims in the united states or anywhere else outside of visa europe’s region arising from our or their activities that relate to our payments business or the payments business of visa europe this obligation applies whether or not we or any of our related parties or agents participated in the actions that gave rise to such claims such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control these liabilities would not be covered by our retrospective responsibility plan 

business risks 

we face intense competitive pressure on customer pricing which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we generate revenues from fees we charge our customers that are based on payments volume transaction messages processed and various other services we provide in order to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand our card base we offer incentives to customers such as upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased growth incentives marketing support payments and other support such as marketing consulting and market research studies over the past several years we have increased our use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives such pricing pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and profitability to the extent that we continue to increase incentives to our customers we will need to further increase payments volume or the amount of services we provide in order to benefit incrementally from such arrangements and to increase revenues and profit and we may not be successful in doing so in addition we enter into longterm contracts with certain customers and continued pressure on fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on terms that we consider favorable or may require us to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships increased pricing pressure also enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives and we may not succeed in these efforts 

our operating results may suffer because of intense competition in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is intensely competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house 

  

payments in addition our payment programs compete against the cardbased payments systems of our competitors such as mastercard american express discover and privatelabel cards issued by merchants 

some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have or may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements our competitors may also introduce more innovative programs and services than ours 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without involving intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of closedloop payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of openloop multiparty payments systems such as ours in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition these competitors have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of openloop multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also expect that there may be changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 

  

  

  

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of our largest customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

a significant portion of our operating revenues are concentrated among our largest customers our pro forma operating revenues from our five largest customers represented approximately 12 billion or 23 and 938 million or 24 of our total pro forma operating revenues for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively in 

  

addition our pro forma operating revenues from our largest customer jpmorgan chase accounted for 454 million or 9 and 408 million or 10 of our pro forma operating revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively most of our larger customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances including in some cases on relatively short notice may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services loss of business from any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

consolidation of the banking industry could result in our losing business and may create pressure on the fees we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone substantial consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in one of our largest customers being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our customers and potential customers and could increase the bargaining power of our remaining customers and potential customers this consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us in addition consolidation could prompt our existing customers to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms pressure on the fees we charge our customers caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

merchants are pursuing litigation and supporting regulatory proceedings relating to the costs associated with payment card acceptance and are negotiating incentive arrangements including pricing discounts all of which may increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our customers to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants that are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry for instance some large merchants are bringing lawsuits against us with regard to or advocating regulation of interchange fees which may represent a significant cost that merchants pay to accept payment cards the emphasis merchants are placing on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may lead to additional regulation and litigation which would not be covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and which could impair our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we along with our customers negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance of our payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate we and our customers may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow faster than the financial institutions that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

  

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers and other third parties to deliver services and manage our payments system as a result our success and reputation are significantly dependent on the success of our customers and the quality of the services they provide if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if third parties on which we depend fail to deliver services on our behalf our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on relationships with our customers and their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not generally solicit merchants to accept our cards and we do not establish the discount rates that merchants are charged for card acceptance which are responsibilities of acquirers as a result the success of our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our customers and the strength of our relationships with them 

outside of the united states and certain other countries most domestic as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using our payment cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our processing systems because we do not provide domestic transaction processing services in these countries do not generally have direct relationships with merchants and never have direct relationships with cardholders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving our cards our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brand 

in addition we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf and to the extent that any third party vendors fail to deliver services our business and reputation could be impaired 

our brands and reputation are key assets of our business and may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to visabranded products is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” which may materially and adversely impact our business adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny 

global economic political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending and crossborder travel which may materially and adversely impact our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending for example a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states and the asiapacific region where approximately 66 and 14 respectively of our pro forma revenues were generated for fiscal 2007 and 71 and 12 respectively of our pro forma revenues were generated for fiscal 2006 or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands a significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the united states results from crossborder business and leisure travel which may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions including the threat of terrorism and outbreak of diseases such as sars and avian flu in particular revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency in addition as we are principally 

  

domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of visa members we are exposed to risk of loss or insolvency if any member fails to fund its settlement obligations 

we indemnify visa members for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of a member to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we indemnify members even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system the indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of the indemnification are unlimited 

while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by any of the largest visa members concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest members or several of the smaller visa members or systemic operational failures that last for more than a single day may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the amount of such payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition settlement at risk or exposure is estimated using the average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle and the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques our estimated settlement exposure after consideration of collateral that we require certain financial institutions to post amounted to approximately 288 billion at october 1 2007 

some visa members are composed of groups of financial institutions some of these members have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently our revenues or operating results and the perception of our brands could be materially and adversely affected 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation as a result of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism or accident our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks leading to an interruption in service increased costs or the compromise of data security additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in the payments industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which could reduce our revenues and income 

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards ecommerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of 

  

technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes or by intellectual property rights of third parties our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenues 

we and our customers merchants and other third parties store cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards in addition our customers may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our cards reputational damage and lead to claims against us for example in january 2007 tjx companies inc a large retailer with stores in the united states canada and the united kingdom disclosed a significant security breach in connection with card and account information which exposed tens of millions of payment cards issued under our brands and our competitors’ brands to fraudulent use if we are sued in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one of our customers merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our costs 

an increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards if fraud levels involving our cards were to rise it could lead to reputational damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs 

visa europe’s payments system operations are becoming increasingly independent from ours and if we are unable to maintain seamless interaction of our respective systems our business and the global perception of the visa brand could be impaired 

visa europe currently has a regionally controlled processing platform in june 2006 visa europe began operating an authorization system that is separate from ours and visa europe plans to begin operating a transaction clearing and settlement system that is separate from ours because we and visa europe have independent processing platforms interoperability must be maintained visa europe’s authorization system has experienced interruptions in service and it could experience further interruptions in the future to the extent that system disruptions occur it may affect our cardholders who are traveling in visa europe’s region and impair our reputation the increasingly independent payments system operations of visa europe could present certain challenges to our business because differences between the two processing systems may make it more difficult to maintain the interoperability of our respective systems in addition under the framework agreement we are restricted from requiring visa europe to implement certain changes that we may deem important unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs any of the foregoing could result in a loss of payments volume or of customers or could materially increase our costs 

  

adverse currency fluctuations could decrease revenues and increase expenses 

we conduct business globally in many foreign currencies but report our financial results in us dollars we are therefore exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because depreciation of nonus currencies against the us dollar reduces the us dollar value of the nonus dollar denominated revenues that we recognize and appreciation of nonus currencies against the us dollar increases the us dollar value of expenses that we incur that are denominated in those foreign currencies we enter into foreign currency hedging contracts to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the value of a limited number of foreign currencies and for a limited period of time typically up to one year 

some of our financial incentives to customers are recorded using estimates of our customers’ performance material changes in our customers’ performance compared to our estimates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in certain instances we offer our customers financial incentives which are typically tied to their payments volume or transaction messages processed often under particular programs these financial incentives are typically recorded as a reduction of revenues we typically make estimates of our customers’ performance under these programs sometimes over several years in order to derive our estimates of the financial incentives that we will pay them the reduction of revenues that we record each quarter under volume and support agreements is based on these estimates material changes in our customers’ performance compared to estimates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for example if a customer performs better than expected we may be required to reduce future period revenues to account for the fact that we did not reduce revenues enough in prior periods on the other hand if a customer performs worse than expected we may conclude that we reduced revenues by too much in previous periods 

we have significant contingent liabilities for settlement payment of all issued and outstanding travelers cheques 

at september 30 2007 we had over 1 billion in contingent liabilities for settlement payment of all issued and outstanding travelers cheques approximately 35 of these travelers cheques were issued outside of the united states by a single issuer while these obligations are supported in part by a bank guarantee if the issuer were to fail to pay we would be obligated to fund partial settlement of presented travelers cheques 

risks related to our structure and organization 

the recent change to our governance structure could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships with our customers 

prior to our recent reorganization a number of visa’s key members had officers who also served on the boards of directors of visa usa visa international visa canada or the regional boards of directors of the unincorporated regions of visa ap visa lac and visa cemea as a result of our reorganization the regional boards of directors of the unincorporated regions have been eliminated and the boards of directors of visa usa and visa canada are now comprised of management and are largely administrative in nature in addition although our regions are represented on our board by six of our 17 directors the holders of our class b and class c common stock are not otherwise entitled to vote in the election of directors as a result the role of membernominated and memberelected directors in our corporate governance has been reduced as a result of the reorganization these changes could have a detrimental effect on our business relationships with members associated with a particular region in addition if a member that had an officer who also served on one of the regional boards of directors does not have an officer who currently serves on our board of directors our business relationship with that member could suffer a significant loss of revenues or payments volume attributable to such members could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our relationship with visa europe is governed by our framework agreement which gives visa europe very broad rights to operate the visa business in visa europe’s region we have limited ability to control their operations and limited recourse in the event of a breach by visa europe 

historically visa europe had been subject to the same global operating rules as visa usa visa international and visa canada these global operating rules regulate among other things interoperability of payment processing brand maintenance and investment standards for products and services risk management disputes between members and acceptance standards for merchants after the reorganization visa europe unlike visa usa visa international and visa canada did not become our subsidiary as a result visa europe is no longer subject to the same global operating rules as our subsidiaries and customers 

our relationship with visa europe is now governed by a framework agreement and a subset of operating rules that we have agreed to with visa europe and that we have limited ability to change in the future although the agreement seeks to ensure that visa europe operates in a manner that is acceptable to us the contractual arrangement is untested and may not be effective in achieving this result visa europe is responsible for designing its own plans to ensure that it is in compliance with the global rules interoperability integrity of the system and trademark usage while we have the right to request changes to these plans we have no right to audit their compliance with these requirements or examine their books and records in connection with the framework agreement or the put option the agreement provides visa europe with very broad latitude to operate the visa business and use our brands and technology within visa europe’s region and provides us limited controls over the operation of the visa business in their region visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount promoting and building the visa brand in its region and the strength of the visa global brand is contingent in part on the efforts of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe visa europe may develop among other things new brands payment processing characteristics products services risk management standards processes for resolving disputes among its members or merchant acceptance profiles that are inconsistent with the operating rules that we apply in the rest of the world 

if we want to change a global rule or require visa europe to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for visa europe and its members then visa europe is not required to implement such rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that visa europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation to the extent necessary to return visa europe and its members to a neutral financial condition we cannot terminate the framework agreement even in the event of visa europe’s material uncured breach and we can only exercise our call right to purchase visa europe under extremely limited circumstances our remedies under this agreement if visa europe fails to meet its obligations are limited our inability to terminate and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of determining our tax treatment with respect to entering into the licenses and receiving payments thereunder any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we are able to provide could negatively affect cardholders from visa europe using cards in our regions or our cardholders using cards in visa europe’s region 

we have granted to visa europe the right to require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of visa europe’s capital stock if visa europe exercises this option we will incur a substantial financial obligation in addition we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis which will impact our net income 

we have granted visa europe a put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time following the date that is the earlier of i 365 days after the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock and ii may 30 2009 the purchase price of the visa europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that subject to certain adjustments applies the 12month forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to visa europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12month period upon exercise of the put option we will be obligated subject only to regulatory approvals and other limited conditions to pay the purchase price within 

  

285 days in cash or at our option with a combination of cash and shares of our publicly tradable common stock the portion of the purchase price we will be able to pay in stock will initially be limited to the percentage of our class c series i common stock that at the settlement date remains subject to the transfer restrictions we must pay the purchase price in cash however if the settlement of the put option occurs more than three years after the completion of our proposed initial public offering 

we will incur a substantial financial obligation if visa europe exercises the put option the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things the 12 month projected sustainable net operating income of visa europe the allocation of cost synergies the trading price of our class a common stock and our 12month forward pricetoearnings multiple in each case as determined at the time the put option is exercised we are not currently able to estimate the amount of this obligation due to the nature and number of factors involved and the range of important assumptions that would be required however depending upon visa europe’s level of sustainable profitability andor our 12month forward pricetoearnings multiple at the time of any exercise of the option the amount of this obligation could be several billion dollars or more we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to meet our obligation this financing may not be available to us in a sufficient amount within the required 285day period or on terms that we deem to be reasonable the payment of part of the exercise price in stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders moreover the acquisition of visa europe following an exercise of the put option would require us to integrate the operations of visa europe into our business which could divert the time and attention of senior management 

we recorded the put option at its fair value in our consolidated balance sheet on october 1 2007 as part of the reorganization in the future we will be required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis these adjustments will be recorded through our consolidated statements of operations which will therefore impact our reported net income and earnings per share such quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these charges could adversely affect our ability to raise capital andor the price at which we can raise capital 

see item 13—“ certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with visa europe—the putcall option agreement ” 

the terms of our reorganization created financial incentives that reward net revenue growth in the four quarters ended december 31 2007 

one of the terms of our reorganization plan was a “true up” mechanism designed to reallocate the shares initially distributed to the members of visa usa and visa international and the former members of visa canada among themselves based on each participating region’s relative under or overachievement of its net revenue targets during a measurement period consisting of the fourquarter period ending with and including the latest quarter for which financial statements are included in the registration statement in connection with our proposed initial public offering on the date it is declared effective by the sec we expect that the measurement period will consist of the four quarters ended december 31 2007 this mechanism creates financial incentives that reward net revenue growth in the measurement period because comparable incentives did not exist in prior periods and will not exist in future periods it is possible that the rate of revenue growth in the measurement period will not be representative of rates that may be expected in future periods 

our management team is new and does not have a history of working together 

we designated joseph w saunders as our chief executive officer and chairman of our board in may 2007 and have since assembled a new management team including john hans c morris our president and byron h pollitt our chief financial officer our success will largely depend on the ability of the new management team to work together to integrate the operations and business of visa usa visa international and visa canada and to continue to execute our business strategy because our management team does not have 

  

a significant history of working together and includes individuals recruited from outside our company they may not be able to work together effectively which could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

our recent reorganization will require us to make significant changes to our culture and business operations if we fail to make this transition successfully our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our recent reorganization will require broad and significant changes to our culture and operations historically the primary goal of visa usa visa international and visa canada has not been to maximize profit for these entities but rather to deliver benefits to their members and enhance member opportunity and revenue as a result of the reorganization we now must operate our business in a way that maximizes longterm stockholder value many of our employees have limited experience operating in a profitmaximizing business environment 

in addition the visa enterprise historically has been operated under a decentralized regional structure and each region has had substantial autonomy in its own business strategies and decisions our recent reorganization has resulted in a more centralized corporate governance structure in which our board of directors exerts centralized management control we face significant challenges integrating the operations of the different regions we may also be unable to retain and attract key employees and we may not realize the cost savings and operational efficiencies that we currently expect this transition will be subject to risks expenses and difficulties that we cannot predict and may not be capable of handling in an efficient and timely manner 

any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may make strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies if so we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any such businesses products or technologies furthermore the integration of any acquisition may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we have no present understandings commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 

our regional classes of common stock our class b common stock and our class c common stock into which our regional classes of common stock may be converted are subject to significant restrictions on transfer and ownership 

the regional classes of our common stock that were issued upon the closing of the reorganization and our class b common stock and class c common stock into which our regional classes of common stock will be converted prior to our proposed initial public offering are and will be subject to significant ownership and transfer restrictions for example subject to limited exceptions shares of our class b common stock may not be transferred until the later of three years from the date of an initial public offering or the period of time necessary to resolve the covered litigation all other regional classes of our common stock and our class c common stock may not be transferred subject to limited exceptions until the third anniversary of the date of an initial public offering during such periods except for limited exceptions holders of our regional classes of common stock and our class b common stock and class c common stock will not be able to transfer such stock to any person or entity other than affiliates of the holder or in the case of class b and class c common stock to holders of common stock of the same class of common stock 

ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock is concentrated in a few of our largest members 

our four largest stockholders own approximately 25 of our outstanding common stock this concentration of voting power could result in these stockholders having the ability to block stockholder action that other holders of our common stock may deem favorable 

  

the us internal revenue service may treat a portion of our common stock received by a member of visa international or visa usa as taxable income 

based on the opinion of our special tax counsel we believe that subject to the assumptions qualifications and limitations contained in such opinion we the members of visa international and the members of visa usa will not recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes in connection with the reorganization and the trueup except that as to a portion of any visa inc stock received in connection with the trueup a stockholder of visa inc may recognize imputed interest income if a stockholder is not a united states person for us federal income tax purposes we may be required to withhold us federal income tax at a rate of 30 of the imputed interest or if applicable at a lower treaty rate 

notwithstanding the foregoing the opinion of our special tax counsel does not apply to the extent that the fair market value of our common stock received by a member of visa international or by a member of visa usa pursuant to the reorganization and the trueup whether received on the date of closing of the reorganization or thereafter is different from the fair market value of such member’s equity interest in visa international or visa usa as the case may be immediately before the commencement of the reorganization our special tax counsel is unable to opine as to such difference because in transactions similar to the reorganization and the trueup treatment as an exchange described in section 351 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended generally applies only to the extent that a taxpayer transfers property to a corporation in exchange for stock having the same fair market value the irs might therefore take the position that the difference whether received on the date of closing of the reorganization or thereafter in the case of an excess of value received over value surrendered should not be treated for us federal income tax purposes as having been received in exchange for property as a result a member of visa international or a member of visa usa could be required to recognize income but only to the extent of the excess or shortfall of value received over value surrendered 

the shares of class b common stock that are retained by members of visa usa will be subject to dilution as a result of the establishment of the escrow account and any followon offerings of our class a common stock the proceeds of which will be used to fund additional amounts into the escrow account necessary to resolve the covered litigation 

the shares of class b common stock that are retained by visa usa members and that are not redeemed out of the proceeds of the proposed initial public offering will be subject to dilution to the extent of the initial amount of the escrow account this dilution of the shares of class b common stock will be accomplished through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock these shares will not be able to be converted into shares of class a common stock or subject to limited exceptions transferred until the later of the third anniversary of an initial public offering or the final resolution of the covered litigation the shares of class c common stock which will be held by members other than the visa usa members will not be subject to this dilutive adjustment after the completion of our proposed initial public offering and at the request of the litigation committee we expect to conduct followon offerings of our shares of class a common stock which we refer to as loss shares if the litigation committee deems it desirable to increase the escrow account the proceeds from the sale of loss shares would then be deposited in the escrow account and the shares of class b common stock would be subject to additional dilution to the extent of the loss shares through a concurrent adjustment to the conversion rate of the class b common stock because the voting power of the class b and class c common stock and the entitlement of the holders of class b common stock and class c common stock to participate in dividends or distributions upon a liquidation or winding up of visa inc is determined on an as converted basis based upon the number of shares of class a common stock into which the class b or class c common stock would be converted at the time of the vote dividend or distribution as applicable the adjustment to the conversion rate applicable to the class b common stock upon the issuance of loss shares will result in a dilution of the voting power of the class b common stock and the entitlement of holders of class b common stock to participate in dividends and distributions upon a liquidation of visa inc 

  

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable except for limited exceptions no person may own more than 15 of our total outstanding shares on an asconverted basis or more than 15 of any class or series of our common stock unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in addition except for common stock issued to a member in connection with the reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock shares held by a member a competitor an affiliate or member of a competitor may not exceed 5 of any class of common stock in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock after the completion of our proposed initial public offering we intend to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our class a class b and class c common stock any future payment of dividends will be dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant furthermore no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class and series of common stock if as a consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make payments of dividends on our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend retrospective responsibility plan 

visa usa and visa international are parties to certain legal proceedings that we refer to as the covered litigation the retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address potential liability under the covered litigation covered litigation means 

 

  

  

  

  

 upon the closing of our proposed initial public offering we intend to deposit a portion of the net proceeds from such offering as determined by the litigation committee in an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation will be payable we intend to use the funds in the escrow account to satisfy the settlement obligations of visa usa in the american express litigation and as described below to make payments relating to obligations of visa usa visa international and in certain instances visa inc in connection with future settlement of or judgments in covered litigation 

  

our class b and class c common stock will be issued pursuant to the conversion of our outstanding regional classes of common stock prior to our proposed initial public offering these different classes of common stock and the series into which they are divided reflect the different rights and obligations of visa financial institution members and visa europe based on the geographic region in which they are located the class b common stock that is retained by visa usa members and that is not redeemed out of the proceeds of our proposed initial public offering will be subject to dilution to the extent of the initial amount of the escrow account this dilution of the class b common stock will be accomplished through an initial adjustment to the conversion rate applicable to each share of class b common stock the class b common stock will not subject to limited exceptions be convertible into class a common stock or be transferable until the later of the third anniversary of our proposed initial public offering or the final resolution of the covered litigation although our board of directors may make exceptions to this transfer restriction after resolution of all covered litigation the class c common stock will not be subject to this dilutive adjustment 

after the completion of our proposed initial public offering and if the litigation committee so requests in order to increase the escrow account we will conduct followon offerings of our class a common stock which we refer to as loss shares the proceeds from the sale of loss shares would then be deposited in the escrow account and the class b common stock would be subject to additional dilution to the extent of the loss shares through a concurrent adjustment to the conversion rate of the class b common stock unless we or our affiliates have actually incurred a liability in respect of the covered litigation and there are insufficient funds on deposit in the escrow account at such time to fund such liability the litigation committee may not request that we sell loss shares in an underwritten offering more than twice in any 12month period and the proceeds from the requested offering must reasonably be expected to be at least 100000000 we will not offer loss shares in an amount that exceeds the number of shares of our class a common stock into which our issued and outstanding class b common stock is then convertible immediately prior to our proposed initial public offering 

any amounts remaining in the escrow account on the date on which all of the covered litigation has been resolved will be released back to us and the conversion rate of the class b common stock then outstanding will be adjusted in the holders’ favor through a formula based on the released escrow amount and the market price of our class a common stock to be issued in our proposed initial public offering 

the litigation committee has been established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among visa inc visa international visa usa and robert r hackney bruce l hammonds peter e raskind charles w scharf and john g stumpf all of whom are affiliated with or acting for certain visa usa members the litigation committee i will determine the amount of the proceeds of our proposed initial public offering to be deposited in the escrow account ii may request the sale of loss shares as described above subject to our right to delay the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement under certain circumstances and iii may recommend or refer the cash payment portion of a proposed settlement of any covered litigation to the visa usa board of directors 

the board of directors of visa usa will not be permitted to authorize any portion of a settlement of any of the covered litigation that would or might require payments out of the escrow account the sale of loss shares or the payment of cash by principal acquirer administrative cheque issuer administrative group or associate members of visa usa which we refer to collectively as specified settlement members unless such settlement has been approved by or is subject to the approval of specified settlement members we refer to such settlements as specified settlements approval of a specified settlement requires the approval of twothirds of the votes of the specified settlement members 

interchange judgment sharing agreement 

on july 1 2007 we entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with visa usa visa international and certain member financial institutions of visa usa in connection with the interchange litigation 

  

under the interchange judgment sharing agreement in the event that a final judgment in the interchange litigation is enforced against a signatory or there is a global settlement involving all signatories each signatory other than visa usa and visa international will pay its membership proportion as defined in the visa usa certificate of incorporation of the amount of any such final judgment that is not allocated to the conduct of mastercard under the terms of the agreement visa usa will pay the amount of such final judgment that is not allocated to the conduct of mastercard and that is not accounted for by the other signatories although it will obtain reimbursement for such payments out of the escrow account visa international has no obligation under the interchange judgment sharing agreement to share in a judgment enforced against another signatory or in a global settlement the agreement provides that visa usa and visa international will be reimbursed by the bank signatories for the full amount of any final judgment allocated to the conduct of mastercard but the bank signatories have no obligation to the other signatories with respect to the mastercard portion of a final judgment 

if we are named as a defendant in a case in the interchange litigation we have the right to join the judgment sharing agreement on the terms applicable to visa international unless a claim relates to our conduct after the reorganization other than the reorganization or our proposed initial public offering or our conduct that is not the mere continuation of conduct being challenged in the interchange litigation at the closing of the reorganization 

loss sharing agreement 

we have entered into a loss sharing agreement with visa usa visa international and visa usa members representing 61 of the visa usa aggregate membership proportion the loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of visa usa visa international and in certain circumstances visa inc with respect to i the amount of a final judgment paid by visa usa or visa international in the covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories or ii the damages portion of a settlement of a covered litigation that is approved as required under visa usa’s certificate of incorporation by the vote of visa usa’s members the several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against visa usa visa international or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement or the amount of any approved settlement of a covered litigation multiplied by such bank’s thencurrent membership proportion as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation 

visa usa will be responsible for the remainder of any amounts under i and ii above after taking into account the total amounts owed by the visa usa members that are parties to the loss sharing agreement and any funds it recovers pursuant to a judgment sharing agreement such remainder amounts are subject to indemnification by visa usa members that are not parties to the loss sharing agreement as described below 

we contemplate that payments due under any covered litigation that are subject to the loss sharing agreement will be paid out of the escrow account including any additional proceeds from the sale of loss shares if funds in the escrow account are insufficient to satisfy such obligations then each visa usa member that is a party to the loss sharing agreement is required to contribute an amount equal to the unsatisfied obligation multiplied by such party’s then current membership proportion 

in order to avoid a double payment as a result of the dilutive adjustment in the conversion rate of the class b common stock upon the establishment of the escrow account we will reimburse visa usa members from the escrow account for payments made i pursuant to the interchange judgment sharing agreement in respect of covered litigation to a claimant or another party to the loss sharing agreement other than payments allocated in a final judgment or approved settlement to mastercard’s conduct or ii pursuant to the interchange judgment sharing agreement or the loss sharing agreement for certain payments made prior to our proposed initial public offering relating to the items described in the immediately preceding paragraph in the event that the escrow account contains insufficient funds to make such reimbursements all reimbursements will be made pro rata 

  

indemnification by visa usa members 

the members of visa usa have indemnification obligations with respect to the covered litigation pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements although we currently intend to use the escrow amount including any additional proceeds from the sale of loss shares to satisfy obligations under the covered litigation before seeking to enforce these indemnification obligations 

to the extent that the initial escrow amount and any additional sale of loss shares is insufficient to fully satisfy obligations under the covered litigation and reimburse judgment sharing and loss sharing payments by visa usa’s members we will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of visa usa’s members for such excess amount including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to the loss sharing agreement visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements 

covered litigation 

the discover litigation 

on october 4 2004 discover financial services inc filed a complaint against visa usa visa international and mastercard the complaint was filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york and was designated as a related case to the doj litigation and was assigned to the same judge who issued the doj decision described under “— other legal and regulatory proceedings — department of justice antitrust litigation and related litigation ” the complaint alleged that the implementation and enforcement of visa’s bylaw 210e and mastercard’s competitive programs policy or cpp which prohibited their respective members from issuing american express or discover cards as well as visa’s “honor all cards” rule which required merchants that accept visa cards to accept for payment every validly presented visa card and a similar mastercard rule violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act as well as california’s unfair competition act in an alleged market for general purpose card network services and an alleged market for debit card network services the complaint also challenged visa’s no surcharge rule and a similar mastercard rule under the same statutes on december 10 2004 visa usa and visa international moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim in lieu of filing its opposition papers to this motion discover filed an amended complaint on january 7 2005 in the amended complaint discover dropped some of its claims including its challenge against the no surcharge rule and its claims under california’s unfair competition law but continued to allege that the implementation and enforcement of visa usa’s bylaw 210e mastercard’s cpp and the “honor all cards” rule violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act on june 7 2007 discover filed a second amended complaint which eliminated allegations related to the “honor all cards” rule dropped attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against mastercard and visa international to conform to the court’s rulings on motions to dismiss and made technical changes to the names of the plaintiffs 

specifically discover claims that visa usa’s bylaw 210e unreasonably restrained trade by prohibiting financial institutions that were members of visa usa from issuing payment cards on the discover network in the united states discover requests that the district court apply collateral estoppel with respect to the court’s final judgment in the doj litigation and enter an order that bylaw 210e and the cpp have injured competition and caused injury to discover discover seeks treble damages in an amount to be proved at trial along with attorneys’ fees and costs on february 7 2005 visa usa and visa international moved to dismiss discover’s amended complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim on april 14 2005 the district court denied at this stage in the litigation discover’s request to give collateral estoppel effect to the findings in the doj litigation however the district court indicated that discover may refile a motion for collateral estoppel after discovery under the doctrine of collateral estoppel a court has the discretion to preclude one or more issues from being relitigated in a subsequent action if 1 the same issues were actually litigated and determined in the prior action 2 proof of those issues was necessary to reach the prior judgment and 3 the party to be estopped had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues in the prior action accordingly if the district court were to give 

  

effect to collateral estoppel on one or more issues in the future then significant elements of plaintiffs’ claims would be established thereby making it more likely that visa usa and visa international would be found liable and making the possibility of an award of damages more likely in the event all issues are subsequently decided against visa usa and visa international in dispositive motions during the course of the litigation then there is the possibility that the sole issue remaining will be whether a damage award is appropriate and if so what the amount of damages should be 

also on april 14 2005 and in subsequent rulings with respect to the alleged market for general purpose card network services the district court denied visa usa’s motion to dismiss discover’s section 1 conspiracy to restrain trade claims and section 2 monopolization attempted monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize claims that were based upon the conduct described above on october 24 2005 the court granted visa international’s motion to dismiss discover’s attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against it because plaintiffs did not allege that visa international individually had sufficient market share to maintain these claims on november 9 2005 the court denied visa usa and visa international’s motion to dismiss discover’s claims based upon effects in an alleged debit market visa usa and visa international answered the amended complaint on november 30 2005 fact discovery is complete 

at a hearing on april 25 2007 the district court set a trial date of september 9 2008 the court also established deadlines and procedures for motions practice and expert discovery on july 24 2007 discover served its expert’s report purporting to demonstrate that it had incurred substantial damages expert reports were served jointly by visa usa and visa international on october 9 2007 

in accordance with sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” visa usa recorded a litigation provision of 650 million related to the discover matter at september 30 2007

other legal and regulatory proceedings 

in addition to the matters described above we are a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are not possible to ascertain at present accordingly we have not established reserves for any of these proceedings including the matters described above other than for the currency conversion litigation and the gmri inc case see “— retailers’ litigation ” and “— currency conversion litigation ” except for those matters described above under “— retrospective responsibility plan ” and below we do not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party would have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows although we believe that we have strong defenses for the litigations and regulatory proceedings described above under “— retrospective responsibility plan ” and below we could in the future incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

notwithstanding our belief if we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit or on the basis of a claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable charges we may be required to record could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent and result in a

department of justice antitrust case and related litigation 

in october 1998 the us department of justice or doj filed suit against visa usa visa international and mastercard in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that both visa usa’s and mastercard’s governance structures and policies violated us federal antitrust laws first the doj claimed that “dual governance”—the situation where an employee of a member financial institution also serves on the board of directors of visa usa or mastercard while a portion of its card portfolio is issued under the brand of the other association—was anticompetitive and acted to limit innovation within the payment card industry second the doj challenged visa usa’s bylaw 210e which prohibited visa members from issuing american express or discover cards and challenged a similar mastercard rule known as the competitive programs policy or cpp the doj alleged that visa usa’s bylaw 210e and mastercard’s cpp acted to restrain competition 

  

on october 9 2001 the district court issued an opinion upholding the legality and procompetitive nature of dual governance however the court also held that visa usa’s bylaw 210e and mastercard’s cpp constituted unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws 

on november 26 2001 the court issued a final judgment that ordered visa usa to repeal bylaw 210e and enjoined visa usa and visa international from enacting or enforcing any bylaw rule policy or practice that prohibits its issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network the final judgment also provided that from the effective date of the final judgment october 15 2004 until october 15 2006 visa usa and visa international were required to permit any issuer with which they had entered into an agreement prior to the effective date of the final judgment pursuant to which agreement the issuer committed to maintain a certain percentage of its general purpose card volume new card issuance or total number of cards in force in the united states on the visa network to terminate that agreement without penalty provided that the reason for the termination was to permit the issuer to enter into an agreement with american express or discover the final judgment imposed parallel requirements on mastercard 

visa usa and visa international appealed the judge’s ruling with respect to bylaw 210e on september 17 2003 a threejudge panel of the second circuit issued its decision upholding the district court’s decision on october 4 2004 the supreme court denied visa usa and visa international’s petition for certiorari thereby exhausting all avenues for further appeal in this case the final judgment became effective by court order on october 15 2004

on august 18 2005 the court issued an order appointing a special master to hear evidence regarding mastercard’s challenge an evidentiary hearing before the special master occurred in december 2005 in july 2006 the special master submitted his findings of fact and conclusions of law to the court in which he concluded that visa usa did not violate the final judgment in the doj action before october 15 2004—the effective date of the final judgment—but that visa usa did violate the final judgment by continuing to enforce the settlement service fee after october 15 2004 visa usa filed objections to the special master’s report and mastercard asked the court to adopt the special master’s findings and conclusions the court heard oral argument with respect to the proper scope of any remedy on april 23 2007 

  

on june 7 2007 the court issued an opinion and order holding that the settlement service fee violated the final judgment in the doj case at october 15 2004 on june 15 2007 the court issued an amended opinion and order clarifying the remedy in the ruling first the court ordered visa usa to repeal the settlement service fee bylaw second the court gave any visa usa debit issuer subject to the settlement service fee prior to its repeal that entered into an agreement that includes offline debit issuance with visa usa on or after june 20 2003 the right to terminate its agreement provided that the issuer has entered into an agreement to issue mastercard branded debit cards and the issuer repays to visa usa any unearned benefits or financial incentives under its visa usa agreement on june 13 2007 the parties entered into an agreement to toll the statute of limitations on certain potential claims mastercard may have against visa usa in connection with the settlement service fee

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

this management’s discussion and analysis covers fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 and provides a review of the results of operations financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of visa usa inc and its subsidiaries and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings as well as those factors that may affect future earnings the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 

prior to the closing of the global reorganization in october 2007 visa usa along with visa international comprising the operating regions of ap lac and cemea visa canada and visa europe operated as one of five entities related by ownership and membership to visa after the reorganization visa usa visa international and visa canada became subsidiaries of visa inc a delaware stock corporation 

visa usa is a leader in the electronic payments industry in the united states and is responsible for administering visa payment programs in the united states visa usa provides products and services over a secure payments network to support payment programs offered by its member financial institutions to their consumer commercial and merchant customers visa usa’s principal product platforms include consumer credit consumer debit and cash access prepaid and commercial programs visa usa’s primary customers are its member financial institutions participating in the payments network prior to the reorganization visa usa was a regional group member of visa international and operated as a nonstock corporation with approximately 13300 member financial institutions 

visa usa achieved 22 growth in operating revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 this growth reflects a 10 increase in payments volume as defined below on visa usa’s products for the fiscal year with doubledigit payments volume growth in commercial and consumer debit products and an 11 increase in the number of transactions payments volume which is the basis for service fees and transactions which drive data processing fees are key drivers for visa usa’s business payments volume is defined as the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with visa products including pinbased debit volume and excluding cash disbursements obtained with visabranded cards balance transfers and convenience checks which visa usa refers to as cash volume 

operating revenues increased at a higher rate than underlying payments volume growth primarily due to two new acceptance fees which are included in service fees introduced in april 2007 the two new fees include a debit acceptance fee on debit payments volume and a creditcommercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume these fees supersede previously existing issuer programs used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives these changes are designed to simplify the fee structure and improve overall program efficiencies for visa usa and its issuers while continuing to support visa usa’s acceptance growth initiatives while visa usa believes that these fee changes will generate ongoing benefits visa usa does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact in 2007 of the new service fees introduced in the second half of fiscal 2007 growth in operating revenues was also attributable to adjustments from visa usa’s estimates of performance for volume and support incentive agreements as part of its regular quarterly review of these agreements 

visa usa incurred an operating loss in fiscal 2007 as a result of recording a litigation provision of 27 billion of which 19 billion was recorded in connection with the settlement of outstanding litigation with american express visa inc visa usa and visa international entered into an agreement with american express that became effective on november 9 2007 to resolve all current litigation between american express and visa usa and visa international and the related litigation between american express and five codefendant banks under the settlement agreement an initial payment of 113 billion will be made on or before march 31 2008 including 945 million from visa inc and 185 million from the five codefendant banks beginning march 31 2008 visa inc will 

  

pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million per quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion total future payments discounted at 472 over the payment term or 19 billion are reflected in the litigation provision on visa usa’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and longterm accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 visa usa intends to fund its payment obligations under the american express settlement with amounts in the escrow account in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan the remainder of the 27 billion litigation provision includes management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” related to the discover litigation and various other litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters see “ liquidity and capital resources ” and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

the effect of these litigation provisions on visa usa’s earnings was partially offset by the impacts of the introduction of new service fees during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the absence of substantial charges incurred in the prior year related to customer reimbursement for costs associated with visa usa’s holographic magnetic card impairment charges related to visa usa’s mini card license and business expenses related to a 2006 litigation settlement see “ operating revenues—service fees” and “operating expenses—administrative and other” 

in november 2006 visa usa announced plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions over the course of fiscal 2007 this action was intended to help visa usa better align personnel and contract staffing levels with fluctuating project demand as a result of this strategy visa usa reduced its total number of employees by approximately 5 of visa usa’s total workforce at december 31 2006 visa usa incurred severance and related personnel costs of approximately 13 million during fiscal 2007 associated with this program approximately 1 million in additional charges are expected in fiscal 2008 based upon current assumptions for the timing of employee terminations although visa usa believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its plan actual results may differ thereby requiring visa usa to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions at september 30 2007 the related liability in accrued compensation and benefits was 2 million 

in august 2007 visa usa completed the purchase of a parcel of land on the east coast of the united states and commenced construction of a new data center the new data center is intended to support visa usa’s technology objectives related to reliability scalability security and innovation visa usa anticipates that the data center will be completed in 2010 at an estimated total cost of 397 million see “liquidity and capital resources  ”

also included in service fees are acceptance fees which are used to support merchant acceptance and ongoing volume growth initiatives two new acceptance fees were introduced in april 2007 which apply to all consumer debit payments volume and all consumer credit and commercial payments volume these fees supersede previously existing issuer programs prior period revenues associated with previously existing issuer fees have been reclassified from other revenues to this category for comparative purposes in visa usa’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005

pricing varies and may be modified on a customerbycustomer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements in this regard volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers accordingly we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives management regularly reviews volume and support incentives and estimates of performance estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than management’s original expectation or to reflect contract amendments 

international transaction fees 

international transaction fees are assessed to customers on nonus transactions of usbased issuing financial institutions and us transactions of nonusbased issuing financial institutions international transaction fees are generally driven by crossborder payments volume which include the settlement of currency exchange activities in connection with the settlement of multicurrency transactions international transaction fees are influenced by levels of travel and the extent to which visabranded products are utilized for travel purposes these fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed 

other revenues

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

operating revenues 

operating revenues were 36 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively reflecting an increase of 06 billion or 22 the increase in operating revenues reflects increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume exclusive of pinbased debit volume which increased 9 and growth in transactions which increased 11 growth in operating revenues exceeded growth in payments and transactions volumes primarily due to newly introduced service fees while visa usa believes that these changes in fee structure will generate ongoing benefits visa usa does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts in fiscal 2007 of the new service fees 

 

 service fees 

payments volume on visabranded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter exclusive of pinbased debit volume is the basis for service fees payments volume exclusive of pinbased debit volume increased 105 billion or 9 to 13 trillion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to the april 2007 introduction of two new acceptance fees including a debit acceptance fee on all consumer debit payments volume and a creditcommercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume the increase in service fees from these new acceptance fees were offset by the corresponding elimination of previously existing issuer fees used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives the net impact of the new acceptance fees and the elimination of the existing issuer fees resulted in an increase to service fees of 190 million or 12 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

data processing fees 

the increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 data processing fees increased 13 broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from visa usa’s debit processing services related to nonvisa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volumebased discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers of the total data processing fees 122 million or 9 was collectively earned from visa international visa canada and visa europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

  

volume and support incentives 

the decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during management’s regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of 73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 36 million in fiscal 2006 as the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly we currently expect volume and support incentives to increase substantially during fiscal 2008 due to obligations assumed upon retirement of certain issuer programs during 2007 see note 13—restricted assets and liabilities and note 19— commitments and contingencies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts amendments to contracts or new contracts entered into during 2008 

the net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows

the increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by multicurrency payments volume which increased by 10 billion or 15 during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multicurrency payments volume reflecting more crossborder transactions as overall global travel has increased 

  

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased by 127 to 50 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to 22 billion in fiscal 2006 the increase primarily reflects the 27 billion litigation provision which represented 94 of that increase excluding the litigation provision operating expenses increased 191 million or 9 

 

 personnel 

personnel expense increased 4 in fiscal 2007 due to a 26 million charge representing the first installment of a onetime special bonus program of 51 million associated with the establishment of visa inc half of the 51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007 the other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of an initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met the remaining increase of 3 reflects severance expense for certain executives annual salary adjustments which were broadly in line with economic price increases offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007 

network edp and communications 

the increase in network edp and communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following 

 

  

 advertising marketing and promotion 

the increase in advertising marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following 

 

  

 the remaining increase is attributable to additional promotional activity related to visa signature visa small business and consumer debit products these increases were offset by the absence of initial launch expenditures for visa usa’s new brand mark and card design which began in january 2006 and the “life takes visa” advertising campaign which began in february 2006 

  

visa international fees 

although visa usa’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature us economy fees paid to visa international increased due to a onetime fee waiver of 13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007 

professional and consulting fees 

professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following 

 

  

 administrative and other 

administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006 

 

  

  

 in addition after a review of claims submitted visa usa reduced the accrual for reimbursement to customers for production costs related to the discontinued use of visabranded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design by 11 million in fiscal 2007 

litigation provision 

litigation provision increased 26 billion reflecting a 19 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with american express future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted at 472 over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision the litigation provision also reflects management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” related to the discover litigation the american express and discover litigations are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account in accordance with our retrospective responsibility plan the remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters see “— liquidity and capital resources” and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

visa usa is a party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows 

 

  other income expense 

other income was 62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of 8 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in other income primarily reflects an increase in visa usa’s portion of equity earnings from visa international as a result of an increase in net income for visa international and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in visa usa’s investment portfolio from taxexempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities 

the following table sets forth the components of our other income expense for fiscal 2007 and 2006 

 

 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

the increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher visa international net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the retailers’ litigation matter interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal 2008 as a result of the american express litigation  for which accretion will be recorded beginning in october 2008 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

investment income net 

the increase in investment income net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects an increase in interest income due to a shift in the visa usa’s investment strategy from taxexempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixedincome investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year 

  

income taxes 

visa usa’s effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state statutory rates and allowable adjustments to taxable income the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23 represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35 for the prior year represented a tax expense the 23 effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year this benefit was less than would otherwise have been realized primarily as a result of an adjustment in a reserve related to litigation 

the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 

 visa usa’s fiscal 2007 statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of 27 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation this provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the american express litigation and management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 related to the discover litigation and other matters for tax purposes the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of 778 million related to these payments which is net of a reserve to reflect visa usa’s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized 

minority interest 

the decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to visa usa’s plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions see note 16—workforce reduction to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements  

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

operating revenues 

operating revenues were 30 billion and 27 billion in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively reflecting an increase of 03 billion or 11 the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume and transactions both of which increased 17 during fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2006 growth in consumer credit volume continued to favorably impact operating revenues driven largely by visa signature visa usa’s premium credit platform which generates higher fees operating revenues were also impacted by growth in debit volumes and transactions processed reflecting the ongoing impact of certain member conversions to the debit interlink platform 

  

 service fees 

the increase in service fees in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 of 11 was broadly in line with the growth in underlying payments volume exclusive of pinbased debit volume which increased 1510 billion or 15 to 12 trillion in fiscal 2006 reflecting increased spending on all product platforms volumes this increase was offset by a decrease in acceptance fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting lower revenues of 36 million related to a merchant incentive program the program collects fees from customers and the funds are intended to support various merchant programs designed to build payments volume and increase product acceptance beginning in fiscal 2006 the program was modified requiring specific use of related revenues revenues related to the merchant incentive program were therefore deferred and recognized only when expended as designated for specific acceptance programs 

data processing fees 

data processing fees increased 10 primarily due to a 17 increase in the number of transactions processed in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in transactions processed outpaced the increase in data processing fees in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher volumebased discounts resulting from consolidations among financial institution customers despite solid growth in the mix of debit transactions during fiscal 2006 reflecting conversion of various member financial institutions to interlink visa usa’s pinbased debit platform the impact of volumebased discounts across all product lines outpaced the impact of growth of debit transactions of the total data processing fees 122 million and 121 million was earned from visa international visa canada and visa europe in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively 

volume and support incentives 

growth of volume and support incentives in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the execution of new agreements in support of visa usa partnership programs with existing customers and cobranding programs with existing customers and new merchants 

  

the net asset liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows 

 

    international transaction fees 

international transaction fees increased 11 while multicurrency payments volume increased 9 or 44 billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in international transaction fees was higher than the growth in multicurrency payments volume due to the differential between foreign and domestic interchange rates 

other revenues 

the increase in other revenues in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected 

 

  

 operating expenses 

total operating expenses were unchanged at 22 billion for both fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively visa usa reduced its total operating expenses as a percentage of total operating revenues to 75 in fiscal 2006 compared to 83 in fiscal 2005 due to more effective expense management and the absence of certain charges associated with visa usa’s litigation provision expense recorded in fiscal 2005 the charge to litigation provision expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the multicurrency matter that was subsequently settled in fiscal 2006 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

 

   

personnel 

the increase in personnel expense in fiscal 2006 reflected annual salary adjustments which were broadly in line with inflation and a 4 increase in the number of employees in support of various corporate initiatives at visa usa 

network edp and communications 

the decrease in network edp and communications expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected a decrease in software expense of 9 million due to visa usa lowering its threshold for capitalizing software from a unit cost greater than 25000 or an aggregate purchase cost greater than 250000 to a unit cost or aggregate purchase cost greater than 10000 

advertising marketing and promotion 

the increase in advertising marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected higher expenditures for visa usa’s new brand mark and card design launch which began in january 2006 and its “life takes visa” advertising campaign launched in february 2006 

visa international fees 

the decrease in visa international fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected reductions in visa usa’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes as global emerging markets experienced higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature us economy 

professional and consulting fees 

professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to professional contracting fees incurred to provide analysis and support for various programs and projects including product development and innovation call center operations and global processing and system development additional expenses for accounting and auditing services were incurred in conjunction with visa usa’s review of its internal controls over financial reporting and additional legal fees were incurred to support ongoing litigation matters 

administrative and other 

administrative and other expense increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting the following nonrecurring expenses 

 

  

  

   

litigation provision 

the decrease in the litigation provision in fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year was driven by the following 

 

  

  

 total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows 

 

 other income expense 

other expense was 8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to other income of 3 million in fiscal 2005 the decrease in other income primarily reflected the absence of a nonrecurring gainonsale of a joint venture interest in vital processing services llc a financial transaction processor for acquirers and merchants which occurred in fiscal 2005 and lower equity in earnings related to visa usa’s ownership in visa international 

 

 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected lower visa international net income and a decrease in visa usa’s proportionate equity interest in visa international earnings from the prior year reflecting the fact that visa usa comprised a lower percentage of total payments volumebased fees paid to visa international the decrease also reflected the absence of equity in earnings from vital processing services llc following the sale of visa usa’s 50 equity interest in the joint venture during fiscal 2005 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of accretion expense on litigation for certain merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff’s class in the retailers’ litigation matter these litigation matters were settled in the first six months of fiscal 2005 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

investment income net 

the decrease in investment income net in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of a 42 million gain on the sale of visa usa’s 50 equity interest in vital processing services llc in fiscal 2005 the decrease was offset by higher earnings on fixedincome investment securities due to higher average investment balances and higher market interest rates for current year periods compared to the prior year 

income taxes 

visa usa’s effective tax rate decreased to 35 in fiscal 2006 from 40 in fiscal 2005 the lower effective tax rate is primarily attributable to additional tax benefits granted by the state related to visa usa’s tax filing methodology in fiscal 2006 the decrease also reflects the absence of a onetime remeasurement of deferred tax assets related to the adoption of a new state tax filing methodology which occurred in 2005 

the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 

 minority interest 

in september 2005 inovant inc sold a 10 interest in inovant to visa europe and a 6 interest to visa international and its cemea region at a price equivalent to the founder’s cost thereby reducing visa usa’s ownership of inovant from 85 to 69 this increase in third party ownership had a full year impact in fiscal 2006 resulting in increased minority interest expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

visa usa maintains comprehensive cash flow forecasts to project visa usa’s shortterm and longterm liquidity needs and maintains controls and governance over spending and investment decisions visa usa’s corporate investment policy was approved by its board of directors and visa usa’s asset and liability committee oversees visa usa’s treasury activity 

visa usa requires capital resources and liquidity to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 the objectives of visa usa’s investment policy are to maintain integrity of principal to provide adequate liquidity to cover settlement contingency scenarios and operating expenditures including payments of principal and interest on its outstanding debt inclusive of settled litigation and to optimize investment income earned within acceptable risk criteria 

settlement of certain debit transactions due from customers participating in the debit processing service and due to payment networks represents visa usa’s most consistent liquidity requirement these settlement receivables are generally collected on the business day following the day in which the transactions were processed and settlement payables are typically satisfied two days following the processing day visa usa maintains a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net debit settlement during fiscal 2007 visa usa funded average daily net settlement payable balances of 62 million with the highest daily balance being 188 million during fiscal 2006 visa usa funded average daily net settlement payable balances of 62 million with the highest daily balance being 221 million visa international is visa usa’s settlement agent for credit and all other debit transactions 

sources of liquidity 

visa usa’s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and a fixedincome investment portfolio funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investment securities or longterm availableforsale investment securities based on visa usa’s estimates of when those funds will be needed at september 30 2007 september 30 2006 and september 30 2005 visa usa’s total liquid assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investment securities and longterm investment securities were 18 billion 14 billion and 11 billion respectively as reflected in the following table 

 

 on november 1 2007 visa inc visa usa and visa international entered into an agreement with american express to resolve all current litigation between american express and visa usa and visa international and the related litigation between american express and five codefendant banks under the settlement agreement an initial payment of 113 billion will be made on or before march 31 2008 including 945 million from visa inc and 185 million from the five codefendant banks beginning march 31 2008 visa inc will pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million per quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion total future payments discounted at 472 over the payment term or 

  

19 billion are reflected in the litigation provision on visa usa’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and longterm accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 visa inc expects to fund future payments under the american express settlement under its retrospective responsibility plan the plan includes an escrow arrangement in which visa inc will deposit a portion of the expected proceeds from an initial public offering as determined by the visa inc litigation committee a committee established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among visa inc visa international visa usa and the members of the committee all of whom are affiliated with or acting for certain visa usa members into an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in covered litigation will be payable the plan also includes a loss sharing agreement in which visa usa members that are parties to the agreement are responsible for covered litigation in proportion to the member’s ownership percentage as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation this plan includes multistep mechanisms to fund financial obligations of visa usa and visa international related to certain litigation including the american express litigation covered by this settlement agreement see “ business—retrospective responsibility plan ” 

visa usa has an uncommitted credit facility with visa international whereby visa usa or visa international may provide each other shortterm financing with a maximum term of five business days neither visa usa nor visa international has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company there were no outstanding balances at september 30 2007 or september 30 2006 under this arrangement 

in july 2006 visa usa’s board of directors approved a plan to build a new data center on the east coast of the united states at an estimated cost of 397 million which visa usa plans to fund with its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows visa usa completed the land purchase and began construction in fiscal 2007 construction is expected to continue through fiscal 2010 upon completion visa usa will migrate its current east coast data center to this new facility visa usa assesses the estimated cost to build the new data center on a regular basis and the corresponding liquidity required during each stage of the building process in march 2007 visa usa executed two performance bond agreements with the county in which the east coast data center will be constructed to provide assurance that land development and construction will be completed as planned the bonds have a total value of 2 million and become due in the event that land development and construction are not completed as planned at september 30 2007 visa usa had remaining committed obligations of 186 million related to the new data center 

visa usa had negative working capital at september 30 2007 primarily due to the financial statement impact of the american express litigation see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements visa usa believes its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows will be sufficient to fund its business operations working capital requirements capital expenditures future strategic developments and other commitments during fiscal 2008 visa usa anticipates that future increases in its operating cash flows from new acceptance fees initiated in april 2007 will be offset by obligations assumed in connection with the retirement of two restricted liability programs see note 19—commitments and contingencies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements visa usa’s ability to maintain these levels of liquidity could be adversely affected by several factors described under “ risk factors ” including the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which visa usa is a party as part of visa inc visa usa will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of its operating performance and other relevant circumstances 

visa usa has certain offbalance sheet commitments and contingencies that may have significant future cash requirements see “ offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations ” and note 12—pension postretirement and other benefits  note 14—debt  note 19—commitments and contingencies and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

cash flow data 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 71 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year the increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with visa usa’s visa check card program in the prior year see note 13—restricted assets and liabilities to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the increase also reflects higher noncash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 47 million during fiscal 2006 primarily due to payments on litigation matters largely accrued for in fiscal 2005 but settled and paid for in fiscal 2006 in addition lower levels of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities these decreases were offset by increases in the liability position of volume and support incentives and higher net income adjusted for noncash items 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above in addition investment securities purchasing activity net of sales and maturities was higher during fiscal 2007 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily reflects fewer funds available for the purchase of investment securities as a result of onetime litigation settlements including the multicurrency matter 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on visa usa’s series a senior secured notes due december 2007 and series b senior secured notes due december 2012 see note 14 – debt to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements cash requirements remained stable as the outstanding debt decreased during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under visa usa’s bylaws in effect prior to the reorganization visa usa indemnified issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts travelers cheques or other instruments processed in accordance with its operating regulations visa international is visa usa’s settlement agent visa usa partially indemnifies visa international from losses due to the failure of a member the term and the amount of the indemnity is not limited visa usa is responsible for losses up to 10 million plus 003 of visa usa’s payments volume excluding interlink for the year preceding the loss or approximately 40 million in fiscal 2007 currently settlement is guaranteed by members through the indemnification provisions in the bylaws of visa usa and visa 

  

international and through separate member agreements with the individual members upon the closing of an initial public offering members will no longer indemnify visa for settlement obligations other than their own settlement obligations and those of certain other participants in the system sponsored by the member 

in conjunction with visa usa’s purchase of inovant inc from visa international on january 1 2003 visa usa agreed to indemnify visa international in the event of future tax liability in connection with an adverse determination by a taxing authority resulting from the sale of stock of inovant inc the indemnification is effective for 10 years and extends through 30 years or the statute of limitation in the event of a tax extension for the year of the stock repurchase the maximum probabilityweighted liability is considered immaterial and no liability has been accrued for this obligation 

visa usa has no special purpose entities or offbalance sheet debt other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business and reflected in the contractual obligations table below 

contractual obligations 

visa usa’s contractual commitments will have an impact on its future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both onand offbalance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations at the end of fiscal 2007 visa usa believes that it will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and its existing cash balances 

 

          

see note 14—debt  note 19—commitments and contingencies and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

visa usa also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and other incentive plans see note 12—pension postretirement and other benefits to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

related parties 

prior to the closing of the reorganization during october 2007 visa usa conducted business as a nonstock nonassessable membership corporation the principal members of visa usa were approximately 1600 financial institutions that participated directly in visa usa’s payment programs in addition there were approximately 11700 associate and participant members that participated in visa usa’s payment programs through one or more principal members 

at september 30 2007 visa usa’s board of directors was comprised of exofficio directors individuals who were also officers of various member financial institutions that are also visa usa’s customers and independent directors visa usa generated total operating revenues of approximately 903 million 808 million and 884 million from financial institutions with officers that also served on its board of directors in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 a significant portion of visa usa’s operating revenues were generated from one customer with an officer that also served on the board of directors operating revenues from this customer were 454 million or 13 408 million or 14 and 345 million or 13 of visa usa’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally operating revenues generated from a customer which did not have an officer on the board were 384 million or 11 in fiscal 2007 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of visa usa’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 see note 18—related parties to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the loss of these customers could adversely impact visa usa’s operating revenues and operating income 

critical accounting estimates 

visa usa’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 2—significant accounting policies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of visa usa’s consolidated financial statements visa usa has established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of visa usa’s current accounting policies involving significant management judgment 

  

management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate visa usa’s reported financial results as they require management’s most subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

   

   

   

 seasonality 

visa usa does not experience a pronounced seasonality in its business no individual quarter of fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005 has historically accounted for more than 30 of annual revenue 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for the benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 visa usa expects the adoption of fin 48 on october 1 2007 will result in an increase to accumulated net income of approximately 63 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “ fair value measurements ” sfas 157 which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 visa usa is in the process of determining the effect if any of adopting sfas 157 on its consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “ employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r ” sfas 158 which amends fasb issued statement no 87 “ employers’ accounting for pensions ” sfas 87 and fasb issued statement no 106 “ employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions ” sfas 106 to require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet under sfas 158 

  

gains and losses prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under sfas 87 and sfas 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax effects until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost in addition sfas 158 requires that the measurement date the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets are measured be the company’s fiscal year end visa usa adopted the recognition provision of sfas 158 at september 30 2007 

visa usa adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 at october 1 2006 using the 15month approach under this approach visa usa recorded an additional 3 months of net periodic benefit cost covering the period between the previous measurement date of june 30 2006 and september 30 2006 the benefit expense of 87 million net of tax was recorded as a reduction to beginning accumulated net loss income at october 1 2006 

the effects to visa usa of applying the recognition and measurementdate provision of sfas 158 on individual line items in visa usa’s consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 are as follows 

 

 in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to sfas 115 ” sfas 159 sfas 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis under a fair value option sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after november 15 2007 visa usa is in the process of determining the effect if any of adopting sfas 159 on its consolidated financial statements 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices visa usa is exposed to two significant market risks that could affect its business including changes in interest rates and equity prices visa usa does not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

a significant portion of visa usa’s investment portfolio assets is held in fixedincome securities these assets are reflected as cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm availableforsale investments visa usa does not consider its cash and cash equivalents or its auction rate securities to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities or repricing characteristics of three months or less the fair value balances of visa usa’s shortterm and longterm availableforsale investments at september 30 2007 and september 30 2006 include 

 

 visa usa manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing primarily in rateadjustable or shortterm securities and a modest amount of fixed rate government agency securities to support longer term obligations however visa usa’s efforts do not provide complete assurance that it will be protected from interest rate fluctuations a sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of visa usa’s investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the fair value of the investment portfolio by approximately 7 million or 2 million respectively at september 30 2007 and approximately 12 million and 6 million respectively at september 30 2006 

equity price risk 

visa usa owns equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with visa usa’s longterm incentive and deferred compensation plans equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans for these plans employees bear the risk of market fluctuations gains and losses experienced on these equity investments are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense respectively the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense respectively by 5 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006

we believe that the reorganization provides us with several significant strategic benefits it allows us to increase our operational efficiency and enhances our ability to deliver more innovative products and services to 

  

financial institutions merchants and cardholders on a global basis the reorganization allows us to centralize and streamline our strategy and decision making we also believe that the reorganization and our proposed initial public offering will enable us to facilitate a common global approach where appropriate to the legal regulatory and competitive issues arising in today’s marketplace at the same time we believe that the reorganization preserves and reinforces the advantages that have made visa the largest retail electronic payments network in the world 

industry overview 

the global payments industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which is undergoing a major shift from paperbased payments such as cash and checks to cardbased and other electronic payments for more than 30 years visa has played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers businesses governments and merchants we believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience security enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms we also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency control and security and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience 

the global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer including 

 

  

  

   

we believe that the shift to electronic payment forms is a worldwide phenomenon however in many developing countries it is at an early stage and will be accelerated by rising incomes globalization of commerce and increased travel recent innovations such as contactless cards and mobile payments are also increasing the attractiveness of electronic payments we believe these trends create a substantial growth opportunity for the global payments industry according to the nilson report global card purchase transactions grew at a cagr of 14 over the period from 2000 to 2006 the nilson report forecasts global card purchase transactions to increase at a cagr of 11 from 2006 to 2012 with particularly strong growth in asiapacific latin america and the middle eastafrica 

 

source the nilson report issue 866 october 2006 and issue 885 august 2007 

the most common cardbased forms of payment are generalpurpose cards which are payment cards that permit widespread usage general purpose cards are typically categorized as 

 

  

  

 the primary global general purpose card brands include visa mastercard american express discover jcb and diners club while these brands—including visa—were historically associated primarily with credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets visa and others have over time broadened their offerings to include debit atm prepaid and commercial cards 

in addition to general purpose cards a number of retailers and other entities issue limitedpurpose credit charge and prepaid cards that can be used for payment only at the issuing entity these cards are generally referred to as private label cards private label cards are sometimes issued by a financial institution under a contractual agreement with the retailer 

  

openloop versus closedloop payments networks 

general purpose and limitedpurpose payments networks primarily operate under two different business models openloop payments networks such as visa and mastercard are multiparty and operate through a system that connects two financial institutions—one that issues the card to the cardholder known as the issuing financial institution or issuer and one that has the banking relationship with the merchant known as the acquiring financial institution or acquirer—and manages information and the flow of value between them in a typical closedloop payments network the payment services are provided directly to merchants and cardholders by the owner of the network without involving thirdparty financial institution intermediaries closedloop networks can range in size from networks such as american express and discover which issue cards directly to consumers and serve merchants directly to an individual merchant that issues limitedpurpose privatelabel credit cards to its customers for use only in that merchant’s stores in recent years the major closedloop networks have begun to develop relationships with financial institution issuers and acquirers thereby emulating certain aspects of the openloop networks 

operators of openloop networks such as visa generally do not issue cards set fees or determine interest rates that cardholders are charged for use of their cards issuers have the responsibility for determining these and many other card features in addition such networks generally do not solicit merchants directly or establish the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance including the merchant discount rate both of these functions are generally the responsibility of acquirers the following table outlines the major functions of each of the three major participants in the payments network 

 

   

  largest operators of openloop and closedloop retail electronic payments networks

 our primary operations 

there are three core aspects of our business operations transaction processing services product platforms and payments network management 

transaction processing services 

core processing services 

our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of transactions between visa issuers which are the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders and acquirers which are the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants in addition we offer a range of valueadded processing services to support our customers’ visa programs and to promote the growth and security of the visa payments network 

  

authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholder’s account the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies settlement is the process of calculating determining reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared 

visa transactions can be authorized cleared and settled either as dualmessage transactions or as singlemessage transactions the choice of processing method may vary depending upon the issuer the type of card or the region in which the transaction takes place 

 

  

 authorization 

a typical visa transaction begins when the cardholder presents his or her visa card to a merchant as payment for goods or services the transaction information is then transmitted electronically to the issuer for authorization in certain cases we may authorize the transaction on behalf of the issuer through a service known as standin processing based on parameters established by the issuer the following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction authorized through our network in a typical visa transaction the authorization process by visa occurs in approximately one second 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

clearing and settlement 

clearing occurs at the time of the authorization for singlemessage transactions or in a single daily batch message containing all transactions reported by the acquirer for dualmessage transactions settlement occurs on each business day and is conducted on a net basis for all transactions submitted during the previous settlement cycle the following diagram illustrates the clearing and settlement process between the issuer and acquirer for a typical transaction processed through our system 

clearing 

 

  

  

 settlement 

 

  

 the issuer and acquirer involved in a typical visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor for example the acquirer credits the merchant’s account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer in addition the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment in the case of a credit or deferred debit card or collects payment directly from the cardholder’s deposit account in the case of a debit card 

we process virtually all transactions within the united states as well as all crossborder transactions involving products carrying our brands outside of the united states and certain other countries we do not process the majority of the domestic transactions ie transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in the same country on products carrying our brands such transactions are generally processed by governmentcontrolled payments networks our financial institution customers independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our financial institution customers 

we perform clearing and settlement through our visanet system for transactions involving an issuer that is located in visa europe’s region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world or vice versa in addition we currently provide clearing and settlement services for visa transactions occurring entirely within visa europe’s region and will continue to provide such services until completion of deployment of visa europe’s own processing system visa europe authorizes transactions for its members through its own processing system 

  

other valueadded processing services 

the size of our network and our processing capabilities allow us to offer a range of other valueadded services in certain countries these services include risk management debit issuer processing loyalty services dispute management and valueadded information services 

risk management services  our centralized and integrated network architecture allows us to monitor on a realtime basis all transactions that we process for authorization as a result we provide customers in certain countries with a number of valueadded riskmanagement services which complement our core authorization services our risk management services provide preventive monitoring investigative and predictive tools which are intended to mitigate and help eliminate fraud at the cardholder and merchant level for example visa advanced authorization which we introduced in 2005 enables us to monitor and evaluate visanet authorization requests in realtime and deliver enhanced transaction risk scores to issuers as part of the authorization message it is the first system of its kind to deliver risk indicators in realtime by assessing transaction data on both an account level and a transaction level 

debit issuer processing services visa debit processing services provides comprehensive processing services for participating united states issuers of visa debit prepaid and atm payment products in addition to core issuer authorization processing visa debit processing services offers card management services exception processing pin and atm network gateways call center services fraud detection services and atm terminal driving visa debit processing services processes more visa transactions than any other issuer processor in the world 

loyalty services  we offer loyalty services that allow our customers to enhance the attractiveness of their visa payment programs and to strengthen their relationships with cardholders and merchants these services are designed to allow our customers to differentiate their visa program offerings to support increased card usage and to increase the importance of visa payments to merchants 

visa extras is a service that participating issuers may offer to their cardholders to increase card usage enhance the value of their visa programs and create stronger cardholder relationships visa extras is a pointsbased program that rewards cardholders for using their enrolled visa cards to make qualifying purchases cardholders can redeem points for rewards in the visa extras rewards catalog for everyday items such as movie tickets retail gift certificates merchandise travel certificates dining and other rewards 

the visa incentive network enables merchants and financial institution customers to deliver tailored merchant offers to targeted groups of cardholders visa incentive network offers benefits traditionally associated with a closedloop system visa incentive network was launched in april 2005 and allows us to deliver merchant promotions to affluent and highspending visa cardholders on behalf of participating issuers based on merchantspecific cardholder spending and location criteria for each promotion we can analyze the spending patterns of visa credit card holders in the united states about which information is provided to us by participating card issuers we then deliver the promotion to the appropriate cardholders on behalf of these issuers in order to protect cardholder privacy the merchant does not gain access to cardholder information or underlying transaction data the visa incentive network database contains more than 80 million accounts visa incentive network is enabled through account level processing which allows transactions to be processed and afforded customized treatment at the account level—ie by identifying each transaction by the entire 16digit account number—rather than by the sixdigit bank identification number or bin as is the more typical industry practice we are able to implement account level processing as a result of our reengineered visa integrated payment platform as described below 

dispute management services  we manage visa resolve online an automated webbased service that allows our customers’ backoffice analysts and customer service representatives to manage and resolve visa transaction disputes more efficiently than with previous paperbased processes transaction disputes between issuers and acquirers sometimes arise from suspected fraud merchant nonfulfillment of transaction requirements 

  

or other events visa resolve online which is mandatory for all visa customers provides realtime access to visa transaction data electronic transfer of substantiating documents and automated management of communications between issuers and acquirers 

valueadded information services  we provide our customers with a range of additional informationbased business analytics and applications as well as the transaction data and associated infrastructure required to support them through these services we support and enhance our customers’ business intelligence capabilities loyalty applications operational and management performance metrics transaction research and commercial card reporting 

processing infrastructure 

we own and operate visanet our secure centralized global processing platform which consists of three synchronized processing centers in addition visa europe operates one processing center in the united kingdom which is part of our synchronized system in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement in addition we are building a new data center on the east coast of the united states these centers are linked by a global telecommunications network which is engineered for redundancy intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and valueadded services 

in september 2006 we completed a fiveyear reengineering program in which we among other things consolidated the authorization functions for our credit debit prepaid and atm transactions into one technology platform called visa integrated payment or vip vip is a modular processing platform which is flexible and secure and combines global reach with the processing power to support our future growth and product innovation 

the following is a summary of critical attributes of our processing infrastructure 

centralized architecture unlike the processing platforms of some of our primary competitors visanet is built on a centralized architecture rather than a distributed architecture as a result we are able to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in realtime and can provide valueadded information such as risk scoring or loyalty applications to the issuer while the transaction data is being routed through our system 

redundancy our global telecommunications network and processing centers are designed for redundancy and failover our newest processing center houses multiple authorization engines each supported by redundant power and telecommunications circuits this new architecture complements our multiple processing center architecture provides improved failover technology and helps to ensure that our visanet system is always available and has enough processing power to meet the growing demand for electronic payments 

modular architecture in the vip reengineering project that we completed in september 2006 we replaced a complex web of legacy code with a streamlined layered modular architecture we believe that this new architecture significantly reduces the time complexity and cost involved in adding functions or modifying the system to support emerging forms of payments such as contactless and mobile payments we also believe that this streamlined architecture was instrumental in our ability to implement account level processing on our systems in less than 12 months 

processing scale  during fiscal 2007 we processed more than 78 billion authorization clearing and settlement requests based on tests that we conducted with ibm in july 2005 we estimate that visanet is capable of processing more than 12000 transaction messages per second we believe that the scale of our processing network provides us with a significant cost advantage over our competitors 

  

product platforms 

we offer a broad range of product platforms to enable our customers to build differentiated competitive payment programs for their consumer business government and merchant clients our principal payment platforms enable credit charge deferred debit debit and prepaid payments as well as cash access for consumers businesses and government entities our payment platforms are offered under our visa visa electron interlink and plus brands 

consumer credit 

our consumer credit product platforms allow our issuers to offer deferred payment and financing products that can be customized to meet the needs of all consumer segments our baseline consumer credit platform is marketed to our issuers as visa traditional in the united states and visa classic in the rest of the world we require issuers offering credit products based on this platform to meet minimum requirements for product functionality and to offer certain services such as a reporting service for lost or stolen cards 

in addition we offer premium credit platforms which enable our issuers to tailor programs to consumers requiring higher credit lines or enhanced benefits such as loyalty programs our premium consumer credit platforms are marketed to issuers and in some cases to cardholders as visa gold visa platinum visa signature and visa infinite issuers offering these credit products are required to provide certain functionality and enhanced cardholder services that may vary by product and region for example we require that issuers provide a minimum level of cardholder rewards value and that they not impose a preset spending limit on visa signature cards 

we provide a number of additional services that many issuers choose to offer in conjunction with their visa credit programs even where we do not require the inclusion of such services certain of these services such as emergency card replacement travel assistance services and rental car insurance are provided by third parties under contract with us 

consumer deposit access 

our deposit access product platforms enable our issuers to offer consumer payment and cash access products that draw upon consumer deposit accounts such as checking demand deposit asset or other prefunded accounts for the 12 months ended june 30 2007 consumer debit and cash access products accounted for the majority of visa transactions worldwide 

consumer debit 

visa debit  our primary consumer debit platform uses the visa brand mark through our rules and product platform requirements we further segment our visa debit product platform into visa classic visa gold visa platinum and visa infinite which allows our issuers to customize their visa debit programs and offer a range of benefits to their debit cardholders 

interlink debit  we provide the interlink debit product platform in the united states and certain countries in the ap region interlink is a singlemessage pointofsale debit network it generally requires a cardholder to enter a personal identification number or pin for authentication interlink allows our issuers to provide a full range of debit card offerings to their deposit account customers interlink acceptance marks may be included on visa debit cards or issued as standalone debit cards 

visa electron debit  visa electron is a payment product platform that permits issuers to require all transactions initiated from the card to be authorized electronically it is primarily used by issuers offering payment programs to higher risk customer segments or in countries where electronic authorization is less 

  

prevalent such as certain markets in the ap lac and cemea regions visa electron is primarily issued as a consumer debit product but visa electron can also be issued as a credit or prepaid product for consumers or businesses 

pos check service  the visa pos check service enables merchants to convert the account information on a consumer’s check into an electronic visa transaction message at the point of sale if the check is drawn on a demand deposit account held at a participating visa customer this service which is currently offered only in the united states reduces the cost and time involved in merchant and financial institution processing of checks by taking advantage of visa’s efficient electronic payments processing 

cash access 

our customers can provide global cash access to their cardholders by issuing products accepted at visa and plus branded atms most visa and visa electron branded cards offer customers cash access at atms as well as at branches of our participating financial institution customers the plus brand may also be included on issuers’ nonvisa branded cards to offer international cash access as a complement to domestic cash access services we believe that more than one million visa and plus branded atms are available in more than 170 countries payment cards may contain multiple cash access brand marks in addition to visa and plus and transactions involving visa and plus branded cards will generally be processed through our systems only if there is no regional or domestic atm brand that is capable of processing the transaction 

prepaid 

our prepaid product platform enables issuers to offer products that access a designated pool of funds allowing cardholders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks our prepaid platform includes gift travel youth payroll money transfer voucher replacement corporate incentive insurance reimbursement and government benefits cards our prepaid platforms are also used to pay highway tolls and to top up prepaid mobile phones in some regions prepaid products can be issued as either reloadable or disposable reloadable cards enable consumers or third parties such as employers to add additional funds to the pool consumers may reload cards through various channels including merchants and participating financial institution customers disposable cards cannot be reloaded in this manner our prepaid cards can be distributed through a number of channels including financial institution branches internet sites merchants and employers 

commercial 

our commercial product platforms enable multinational large medium and small companies and government organizations to streamline payment processes manage information and their supply chain and reduce administrative costs our commercial platforms include visa business credit visa business check card visa business debit visa signature business visa business electron visa corporate visa purchasing visa fleet visa distribution visa commercial one card and visa commerce 

large and medium companies and government organizations  the visa corporate product platform offers payment options for travel and entertainment charges including cash advances and provides detailed transaction data which allows companies to track policy compliance and supplier management visa purchasing provides corporate clients with a payment product to easily acquire the goods and services needed to conduct their business by streamlining time and paperintensive purchase order and invoice processing and by providing flexible transaction authorization and verification statements for each cardholder a subproduct of visa purchasing visa fleet provides specialized authorization controls that fleet operators need to monitor and manage spending for companyprovided vehicles visa distribution provides an accounts receivable service for suppliers with dispersed operations the visa commercial one card allows organizations to combine procurement travel and entertainment and fleet functionality into a single payment solution visa commerce is a businesstobusiness electronic platform providing accounts payable and accounts receivable payment services to facilitate large transactions between contracted buyers and sellers 

  

small businesses  the visa business credit and debit platforms provide small businesses with cash flow tools purchasing savings rewards and management reporting visa business electron is an electronic authorization platform used in many countries outside north america and has authorization controls that are similar to those of the consumer visa electron products described above 

core to all visa commercial payment platforms are information management reconciliation and reporting which integrate payment data into company financial systems visa information management is a webbased tool that provides access to a suite of reporting and information tools in multiple languages to companies using any of the visa commercial platforms 

product platform innovation 

we invest in the development and enhancement of payment product platforms with the goal of increasing the migration of consumer and business spending to electronic payments we believe that innovation results in more secure and versatile payment program options for customers merchants and consumers we focus on new payment channels card technologies payment account access devices and authentication methods and have recently made significant investments in the development of contactless payment cards and devices mobile payments chip cards magnetic stripe and unembossed card enhancements and money transfer 

contactless payment cards and devices  we support customer issuance and merchant acceptance of emvcompliant contactless payment cards and devices including contactlessenabled cards minicards and microtags a contactless device contains a computer chip that securely stores account information and transmits it to merchant terminals via secure radiofrequency technology that operates over short distances contactless devices can increase speed and convenience at the point of sale by allowing a consumer to complete a transaction without the need to swipe a card manually or insert it into a pointofsale device we believe that contactless technology is particularly appealing to merchants in segments with high pointofsale throughput and a large proportion of smallvalue transactions 

mobile payments  we support payment origination and acceptance by mobile devices such as mobile telephones and wireless data devices in 2007 we introduced the visa mobile platform a global initiative that provides a comprehensive suite of technology tools and applications designed to promote product development and commercialization of mobile payment services the visa mobile platform is designed to provide consumers with a consistent experience for all types of payments regardless of phone type or geography and is designed to work within the existing infrastructure established by mobile carriers and financial institutions in addition to supporting the development of mobile payment solutions such as contactless payments mobile internet payments and persontoperson payment the platform also supports the development of paymentrelated services such as account management services to enable consumers to monitor account activity through a mobile device and mobile coupons that can be redeemed at the point of sale 

chip cards  in certain regions and countries we support customer issuance of visa and visa electron chip cards which are compliant with the emv integrated circuit card specifications for payment systems in addition to a traditional magnetic stripe chip cards carry encrypted account data on an embedded computer chip that is read by a pointofsale terminal chip cards can offer increased data security over traditional magneticstripeonly cards and can reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud 

magnetic stripe and unembossed card enhancements beginning in october 2003 we introduced a series of rules and standards that allow our customers in certain regions to issue magneticstripe visa cards with enhanced authorization requirements and risk controls that increase their ability to offer visa cards to highrisk consumer segments these standards include codes on the magnetic stripe that instruct pointofsale terminals to request realtime transaction authorizations from the card issuer providing an increased level of control over transaction authorization as compared to magneticstripe cards that lack such codes these standards also permit issuers in certain countries to issue magnetic stripe visa cards with the cardholder name and account number 

  

printed on the card rather than embossed with raised lettering these unembossed cards reduce the risk of fraudulent card use at merchants that do not have electronic point of sale terminals that are capable of seeking transaction authorizations from the card issuer 

money transfer  visa money transfer is a remittance platform that our customers use to allow their cardholders to send funds to other visa cardholders with accounts at participating financial institutions the funds are credited directly to the individual’s visa credit debit or prepaid account our customers can deploy our standard visa money transfer service which includes sophisticated antimoney laundering fraud and risk controls or they can develop their own customized services our customers also offer domestic and crossborder money transfer services using visa prepaid cards in lac cemea and ap regions 

payments network management 

we devote significant resources to ensure that visa is the payments network of choice for customers merchants and cardholders we seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities increasing acceptance of visabranded cards around the world and ensuring that the system operates in a reliable and secure manner for all of our network participants 

brand management and promotion 

we engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand our integrated approach to brand management and promotion combines advertising sponsorships promotions and public relations to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand promote product usage increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention for merchants we work to ensure that the visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment as well as a way to increase their business profitably for our customers our marketing is designed to support their card issuance activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands for cardholders we work to ensure that visa is a symbol of security convenience and acceptance by emphasizing these core attributes of our brand we aim to reinforce the recognition that visa is “the world’s best way to pay” 

advertising plays a critical role in building brand awareness and equity as well as communicating the benefits of our brand and visabranded payment products through our advertising campaigns we strive to provide a consistent recognizable and compelling message that supports our brand positioning during 2006 we launched our “life takes visa” brand campaign in the united states reinforcing our brand promise to deliver innovative products and services that empower our cardholders to experience life and business their way and on their terms in other regions we promote these same brand messages through tailored regional and countryspecific advertising campaigns such as our “all it takes” campaign in ap and our “porque la vida es ahora” campaign in lac 

we establish global marketing relationships to promote the visa brand and to allow customers to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events through these marketing relationships our customers may develop marketing programs that include the visa brand and mention our sponsorship status in addition we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities around other national and local events or with associations and companies to provide customized marketing platforms to customers in certain countries and regions 

our customer and business partner marketing consulting services provide customized advice and support to improve our customers’ cardholder acquisition cardholder retention and product usage efforts we conduct strategic reviews of our customers’ marketing activities and portfolio management practices help them develop acquisition and retention programs develop marketing for new products conduct market segmentation analysis and perform other consultative services in addition to customized consulting projects we offer training to provide our customers with an understanding of best practices for managing their payments business 

  

we also provide marketing support to our customers through our support of visa cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the brand marks of an issuer and a marketing partner usually a merchant while affinity cards generally bear the marks or logos of charitable professional educational or civic organizations 

our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments these programs which we develop in conjunction with merchants generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

merchants play a vital role in our payments network and we work continuously to build our merchant acceptance and enhance our relationships with merchants that accept visabranded cards at june 30 2007 our customers reported that our cards were accepted at more than 28 million merchant outlets around the world 

we aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fastgrowing segments such as bill payment our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations delivering valueadded information services such as the visa incentive network and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment in the united states for example the visa small ticket payment service provides a special interchange rate category and no signature required programs eliminate the requirement for a cardholder signature for certain smallvalue transactions in a number of everyday spend categories including quickservice restaurants movie theatres and public transit under this program the merchant will be protected against no signature chargebacks we believe these initiatives have resulted in a faster checkout process a reduction in merchants’ operating expenses increased merchant acceptance and greater transaction volume in these categories 

we enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our cards 

we continue to respond to the needs of merchants in order to enhance the efficiency of the visa payments network for the benefit of all network participants for example in 2006 we enabled merchants in the united states to obtain copies of key provisions of our us operating regulations thereby increasing access to the rules and procedures that govern merchant participation in our system we also published our us interchange rate schedule and made our us interchange rate qualification guide available to merchants in an effort to educate merchants about the structure of our customer interchange rates and the criteria that determine the specific rate for which a given transaction qualifies 

customer standards 

our financial institution customers participate in the visa payments network through one of two ways financial institution customers that were members of either visa usa or visa international prior to the closing of our reorganization have remained members of those two entities which continue to operate as nonstock subsidiaries of visa inc those financial institutions have nonequity membership interests in the applicable subsidiary which represent the commercial and other rights and obligations with regard to participation in the visa payments system our financial institution customers that were members of visa canada prior to the closing of our reorganization have entered into a series of agreements which govern their commercial rights and obligations with respect to the visa payments system 

  

our customers are generally required to be financial institutions or other deposittaking institutions organized under local banking laws or whollyowned by such institutions certain of our customers participate in the full range of functions such as soliciting cardholders and issuing cards soliciting and signing merchants and acquiring merchant transactions these financial institutions may also sponsor other financial institutions for more limited participation in our network 

rulemaking and enforcement 

in general our customers are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems our customers are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with and in certain cases nonequity membership interests in our subsidiaries these rules and standards govern their use of our branded programs and their participation in our transaction processing system variations on such rules and standards may exist throughout the world in order to meet the needs of specific geographies we require our customers to comply with these rules which relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks the standards design and features of payment cards and programs merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants use of agents disputes between members risk management guaranteed settlement customer financial failures and allocation of losses among customers 

we establish dispute management procedures between customers relating to specific transactions for example after a transaction is presented to an issuer the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons including fraud if the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction the issuer may return or charge back the transaction to the acquirer we enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes 

credit risk management 

we indemnify our customers for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of a customer to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we indemnify customers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system no material loss related to settlement risk has been incurred in recent years 

to manage our exposure in the event our customers fail to fund their settlement obligations we have a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures customers with significant settlement exposure are evaluated regularly to assess risk in certain instances we may require a customer to post collateral or provide other guarantees if a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss we may also apply other risk control measures such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions limiting the use of certain types of agents prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain high risk merchants or suspending or terminating a customer’s rights to participate in our payments network the exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model key inputs to the model include the probability of customers becoming insolvent statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience and estimated settlement exposures at period end 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder or account data including systems operated by merchants financial institutions and other thirdparty data processors fraud is also more likely to occur in association with transactions where the card is not present at the point of sale such as electronic commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants that engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt is generally unavailable 

  

our fraud detection and prevention offerings include verified by visa a global internet authentication product which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code visa advanced authorization which adds additional fraud detection capability by adding realtime risk scores to authorization messages and chip and pin programs that have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud at physical point of sale locations we have also implemented rules that require the use of more secure pin encryption standards for atms and pointofsale pin entry devices installed after 2002 and 2003 and we have recently mandated that all pins transmitted through visanet to the issuer be encrypted using the triple des or data encryption standard by july 1 2010 

in a 2006 cooperative industry effort we cofounded the payment card industry pci data security standards council an independent council that established security standards to protect cardholder data and to prevent fraud in late 2006 we introduced a pci compliance program with both incentives and fines targeted at our largest acquirers in order to improve compliance with the pci standards by our largest usbased merchants which we refer to as level i and level ii merchants the initiative’s goal is to eradicate the storage of prohibited account data such as magnetic stripe also known as track data cvv2 the threedigit security code on the back of the card and pin data and to improve pci compliance among this group of merchants at september 30 2007 99 of level i and level ii merchants had confirmed that they were not storing prohibited account data and approximately twothirds of the level i merchants and almost 45 of the level ii merchants had certified their compliance with the pci standards 

in 2006 we began upgrading all connections to visanet with encryption capabilities to protect data that is transferred to and from visanet and began performing data content analysis to ensure proper data safekeeping and purging of obsolete data in 2006 we also began developing a webbased tool that will replace our legacy riskidentification system to better assist customers in their identification and monitoring of highrisk relationships 

interchange 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange fees are typically paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system we set default interchange rates in the united states and other regions in certain jurisdictions interchange rates are subject to government regulation although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange fees interchange fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards we believe that interchange fees are an important driver of system volume 

we believe the default interchange rates that we use promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by eliminating the need for each of our customers to negotiate transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and ultimately consumers and merchants we believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers merchants our customers and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment and creating incentives for innovation enhanced data quality and security 

interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of jurisdictions including the united states european union australia brazil colombia germany honduras hungary mexico new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom in certain countries such as 

  

australia and mexico interchange rates have been adjusted in advance of or in response to government regulation we are currently devoting substantial management and financial resources to explain the importance of and defend interchange fees and other legal and regulatory challenges we face relating to interchange fees see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—global interchange proceedings ” and item 1a—“ risk factors—interchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business ” 

merchant discount rates  acquirers generally charge merchants a fee for each transaction called a “merchant discount” this fee would typically cover costs they incur for participation in fourparty payments networks including those relating to interchange and compensate them for various other services they provide to merchants merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant customers and are established in competition with other acquirers other payment card systems and other forms of payment we do not establish or regulate merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 

we own a number of valuable trademarks and designs which are essential to our business including visa interlink plus visa electron the “winged v” design the “dove” design and the “bands design—blue white  gold” design we also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands products programs and services through agreements with our customers we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network 

in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing security systems and other matters 

competition 

we compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment including paperbased forms principally cash and checks cardbased payments including credit charge debit atm prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and other electronic payments including wire transfers electronic benefits transfers ach payments and electronic data interchange 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and intense competition worldwide the leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are visa mastercard american express and diners club other general purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions such as jcb in ap and discover in the united states in certain countries our competitors have leading positions such as jcb in japan and china unionpay in china which is the sole domestic payment processor and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china due to local regulation we also compete against privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or other merchant 

in the debit card market segment visa and mastercard are the primary global brands in addition our interlink and visa electron brands compete with maestro owned by mastercard and various regional and countryspecific debit network brands such as star owned by first data corporation pulse owned by discover nyce owned by metavante corporation and others in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia in addition to our plus brand the primary cash access card brands are cirrus owned by 

  

mastercard and many of the online debit network brands referenced above in many countries local debit brands are the primary brands and our brands are used primarily to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume 

some of our major competitors including american express and discover operate closedloop systems closedloop systems can benefit from direct access to consumer and merchant information and they tend to have greater control over cardholder service than do operators of openloop payments networks like visa which depend on their financial institution customers to provide products and services directly to the cardholder in recent years the major closedloop systems american express and discover have begun working directly with issuing and acquiring financial institutions thus emulating certain aspects of the openloop system including setting transfer pricing 

in addition we compete against companies that are developing and implementing alternative payments networks among other things these competitors provide internet currencies which can be used to buy and sell goods online virtual checking programs which permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for both online and pointofsale transactions and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do in mobile commerce we also face competition from established network operators that may be in a position to enable mobile devices to process electronic payments or transfer money and to use their existing billing systems to process these payments and transfers between their customers and third parties without our involvement 

our visa debit processing service is the largest provider of issuer processing services for united states issuers of visa debit prepaid and atm products and thus also competes with third party processors such as first data corporation and tsys 

we believe that the primary factors affecting our competitive position in the payments industry include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry for example as a result of the june 2003 settlement of a us merchant lawsuit against visa usa and mastercard merchants may choose not to accept usissued visa debit cards in the united states while still accepting visabranded credit cards and vice versa in addition following the final judgment in our doj litigation members of visa usa may issue certain payment cards that compete with visabranded cards such as american express or discover while remaining visa members since this final judgment several members of visa usa including but not limited to bank of america citibank hsbcmetris usaa barclaycard us ge consumer finance inc first bank  trust central national bank  trust and brenham national bank have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards outside of the united states our customers have historically been permitted to issue american express cards as well as the cards of other competing general purpose card networks 

  

the banking industry has undergone consolidation and we expect this trend to continue a major financial institution customer may be acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business because continued consolidation in the banking industry results in fewer financial institutions of increased size the bargaining power of the remaining financial institutions increases 

government regulation 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to government regulation of the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used our customers are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence our business is affected by such regulations in recent years our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny in particular interchange fees associated with openloop payments systems such as ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions in which our cards are used 

as the volume of cardbased payments has increased in recent years interchange fees including our default interchange rates have become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a similar approach to interchange fees and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions interchange fees have been the topic of recent committee hearings in the us house of representatives and the us senate as well as conferences held by a number of us federal reserve banks in addition the us house of representatives has passed a bill that would commission a study by the federal trade commission of the role of interchange fees in alleged price gouging at gas stations individual state legislatures in the united states are also reviewing interchange fees and legislators in a number of states have proposed bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction in addition the merchants payments coalition a coalition of trade associations representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards is mounting a challenge to interchange fees in the united states by seeking legislative and regulatory intervention 

interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of jurisdictions including the united states european union australia brazil colombia germany honduras hungary mexico new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom in certain countries such as australia and mexico interchange rates have been adjusted in anticipation of or in response to government regulation 

most jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate have implemented amended or have pending antimoney laundering regulations in 2002 we and our customers became subject to the provisions of the usa patriot act which requires the creation and implementation of comprehensive antimoney laundering programs in general this requires that we make certain efforts to prevent our payments system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities including for example the designation of a compliance officer training of employees adoption of internal policies and procedures to mitigate money laundering risks and periodic audits 

we are subject to regulations imposed by ofac ofac restricts financial dealings with cuba iran myanmar and sudan as well as financial dealings with certain restricted third parties such as identified money laundering fronts for terrorists or narcotics traffickers while we prohibit financial institutions that are domiciled in those countries or are restricted parties from being visa members many visa international members are nonus financial institutions and thus are not subject to ofac restrictions accordingly our payments network may be used with respect to transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to ofacadministered sanctions 

  

in recent years a number of regulations relating to the price of credit and directed at our financial institution customers have been implemented in some jurisdictions in which our cards are used in the united states regulators and the us congress have increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing and underwriting standards relating to credit for example a number of regulations have been issued to implement the us fair and accurate credit transactions act and other regulations are expected to be issued in 2007 one such regulation pertaining to riskbased pricing could have a significant impact on the application process for credit cards and result in increased costs of issuance andor a decrease in the flexibility of card issuers to set the price of credit another such regulation is a significant proposal to amend regulation z which implements the truthinlending act and will change the substance and format of consumer disclosures made by financial institutions in addition the us senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and other committees and subcommittees may continue to consider the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit fees are determined imposed and disclosed any regulation in this regard could impact our customers’ ability to issue cards profitably in certain segments and impact our payments volume and revenues 

we and our customers are subject to regulations related to privacy data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business for example in the united states our customers and we are respectively subject to the banking regulators’ information safeguard rules and the federal trade commission’s rules under the grammleachbliley act respectively these rules require that our customers and we develop implement and maintain written comprehensive information security programs containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue 

in recent years there has been a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the united states a number of bills have been introduced in congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address these issues congress is considering data securitydata breach legislation which if implemented could affect our customers and us in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies for example our customers in china are not permitted to issue cards carrying our brands for domestic use in china governments in certain other countries have considered similar restrictions from time to time 

many jurisdictions in which our customers and we operate are considering or are expected to consider legislation with regard to internet transactions and in particular with regard to choice of law the legality of certain ecommerce transactions the collection of applicable taxes and copyright and trademark infringement if implemented these initiatives could require our customers and us to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions or to take other actions for example draft regulations were proposed on october 1 2007 pursuant to recently enacted us legislation regarding internet gambling which will require our customers and us to code and block certain types of internet gambling transactions comments on these draft regulations were due december 12 2007 and final regulations will be forthcoming at an undetermined date various us regulatory agencies are also considering additional regulation covering capital requirements privacy disclosure rules security and marketing which could impact our customers and us directly increases in fraud or other illegal activity involving our cards could also lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance 

certain of our operations in the united states are periodically reviewed by the federal financial institution examination council to ensure our compliance with applicable data integrity and security requirements as well as other requirements applicable to us as a result of our role as a service provider to financial institutions in 

  

recent years the federal banking regulators in the united states have adopted a series of regulatory measures intended to require more conservative accounting greater risk management and higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders government regulators may determine that we are a systemically important payments system and impose settlement risk management requirements on us including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for customer participation and merchant access to our payments system in addition outside of the united states a number of jurisdictions have implemented legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payments systems for example regulators in australia mexico colombia india singapore and malaysia have been given statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in those countries 

see item 1a— “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in costly new compliance burdens being imposed on us and our customers and lead to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues ” “ —interchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business ” and “ —existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and revenues ” 

employees 

at september 30 2007 we employed 5479 persons worldwide we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 

customers 

at september 30 2007 we had approximately 16600 financial institution customers operating revenues recognized as a result of fees paid net of incentives from our largest customer jpmorgan chase and its affiliates were 408 million in fiscal 2006 and 454 million in fiscal 2007 representing 10 and 9 of our pro forma operating revenues in each such period no other customer represented more than 10 of our pro forma operating revenues 

 

 legal and regulatory risks 

interchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business 

interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an openloop payments network such as ours on purchase transactions interchange fees are typically paid to issuers which are the financial institutions that issue visa cards to cardholders by acquirers which are the financial institutions that offer visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system we set default interchange rates in the united states and other regions in certain jurisdictions interchange rates are subject to government regulation although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange fees interchange fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards we believe that interchange fees are an important driver of system volume 

as the volume of cardbased payments has increased in recent years interchange fees including our default interchange rates have become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a similar approach to interchange fees and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions 

  

interchange fees have been the topic of recent committee hearings in the us house of representatives and the us senate as well as conferences held by a number of us federal reserve banks in addition the us house of representatives has passed a bill that would commission a study by the federal trade commission of the role of interchange fees in alleged price gouging at gas stations individual state legislatures in the united states are also reviewing interchange fees and legislators in a number of states have proposed bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction in addition the merchants payments coalition a coalition of trade associations representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards is mounting a challenge to interchange fees in the united states by seeking legislative and regulatory intervention 

interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities andor central banks in a number of other jurisdictions including the european union australia brazil colombia germany honduras hungary mexico new zealand norway poland portugal romania singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom for example 

 

  

  

  

 regulatory actions such as these even if not directed at us or if affecting a geographic region in which we do not operate may nonetheless increase regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees if we cannot successfully defend our ability to set default interchange rates to maximize system volume our payments system may become unattractive to issuers andor acquirers this result could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our openloop multiparty payments system lower overall transaction volumes andor make closedloop payments systems or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also begin to charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability acquirers could elect to charge higher merchant discount rates to merchants regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchants not to accept cards for payment or to steer visa cardholders to alternate payment systems in addition issuers or acquirers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking incentives from us or a reduction in the fees that we charge any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

a finding of liability in the interchange litigation may result in substantial damages 

since 2005 approximately 50 class action and individual complaints have been filed on behalf of merchants against visa usa visa international mastercard and other defendants including certain visa usa member financial institutions which we refer to as the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegations the 

  

plaintiffs allege that visa usa’s and visa international’s setting of default interchange rates violated federal and state antitrust laws the lawsuits have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the us district court for the eastern district of new york the class action complaints have been consolidated into a single amended class action complaint and the individual complaints are also being consolidated in the same multidistrict litigation a similar case filed in 2004 is on appeal by plaintiffs after having been dismissed with prejudice and has not been transferred to the multidistrict litigation 

the plaintiffs in the interchange litigation seek damages for alleged overcharges in merchant discount fees as well as injunctive and other relief the plaintiffs have not yet quantified the damages they seek although several of the complaints allege that the plaintiffs expect that damages will range in the tens of billions of dollars because these lawsuits were brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and visa usa andor visa international may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established which could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment the interchange litigation is part of the covered litigation which our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address however the retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements of or judgments in the interchange litigation failure to successfully defend or settle the interchange litigation would result in liability that to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent in addition even if our direct financial exposure were covered by our retrospective responsibility plan settlements or judgments involving the multidistrict litigation could include restrictions on our ability to conduct business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth see item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation—the interchange litigation ” 

a finding of liability in the discover litigation may result in substantial damages 

in 1998 the us department of justice filed suit against visa usa visa international and mastercard international in the us district court for the southern district of new york the suit alleged among other things that visa usa restrained competition by prohibiting its member financial institutions from issuing certain payment cards that compete with visabranded cards such as american express or discover which we refer to as competing payment cards the district court held that the prohibition constituted an unlawful restraint of trade under the us federal antitrust laws and this decision was affirmed by the second circuit court of appeals in 2004 the us supreme court denied our petition for certiorari thereby exhausting all avenues for further appeal in this case as a result of this judgment the visa usa bylaw that provided for the prohibition became unenforceable in october 2004 and was subsequently repealed 

discover filed suit against visa usa visa international and mastercard international alleging that prohibiting member financial institutions from issuing competing payment cards caused it injury under the us federal antitrust laws discover has requested that the district court give collateral estoppel effect to the court’s findings in the judgment of the 1998 department of justice litigation although the district court denied that request when made at the outset of the litigation the district court indicated it would entertain a motion by discover for collateral estoppel at a later time if the court were to give collateral estoppel effect to one or more issues significant elements of discover’s claims would be established making it more likely that visa usa and visa international could be found liable and that discover would be awarded damages even if the court declines to give collateral estoppel effect to any of these issues discover may nevertheless be successful in establishing these issues in subsequent proceedings on july 24 2007 discover served an expert report purporting to demonstrate that it had incurred substantial damages because this lawsuit was brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and visa usa and visa international may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established which could significantly magnify the effect of any adverse judgment 

  

american express filed a suit similar to the discover litigation against visa usa visa international and certain visa usa member financial institutions the american express lawsuit is part of the covered litigation which our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address we visa usa and visa international entered into a settlement agreement with american express that became effective on november 9 2007 the settlement agreement in the american express litigation will be funded through our retrospective responsibility plan 

the discover lawsuit is also part of the covered litigation the retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impacts of settlements of or judgments in the discover lawsuit failure to successfully defend against or settle these lawsuits would result in liability that to the extent not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent see item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation ” 

our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements and judgments in the covered litigation and will not insulate us from other pending or future litigation 

our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address monetary liabilities from settlements of or final judgments in the litigation described under item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation ” the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanisms to fund settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation including an escrow account funded with a portion of the net proceeds of our proposed initial public offering and potential followon offerings of our common stock a loss sharing agreement a judgment sharing agreement and the indemnification obligation of visa usa members pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements these mechanisms are unique and complex if we are prevented from using one or more of these mechanisms under our retrospective responsibility plan we could have difficulty funding the payment of a settlement or final judgment against us in a covered litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

the retrospective responsibility plan does not address litigation other than the covered litigation that we currently face including state court litigation relating to interchange and will not cover litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our proposed initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation in addition our retrospective responsibility plan is designed to cover only the potential monetary liability from settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation settlements and judgments in covered litigation may require us to modify the way we do business in the future which could adversely affect our revenues increase our expenses andor limit our prospects for growth therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan adequately safeguards us from the monetary impact of settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation it may not be sufficient to insulate us from all potential adverse consequences of settlements of and judgments in the covered litigation 

the retrospective responsibility plan depends in part on the timely completion of our proposed initial public offering and if we are unable to close our proposed initial public offering in a timely manner we may have insufficient funds to pay settlements of or judgments in such litigation which could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

visa usa and visa international are currently involved in the litigation described under item 3 “ —legal and regulatory proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan ” plaintiffs in these litigation matters have alleged substantial damages upon the closing of our proposed initial public offering we intend to deposit a portion of the net proceeds from such offering as determined by the litigation committee in an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation will be payable we intend to use the funds in 

  

the escrow account to satisfy the settlement obligations of visa usa in the american express litigation and as described below to make payments relating to obligations of visa usa visa international and in certain instances visa inc in connection with future settlement of or judgments in covered litigation the settlement agreement for the american express litigation requires that we make an initial payment of 945 million on or before march 31 2008 and that beginning march 31 2008 we pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million each quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion it may be difficult for us to fund settlement of any of the covered litigation prior to the completion of our proposed initial public offering because we plan to use the escrow account as our primary source of funds for the payment of any potential losses arising from the covered litigation 

further visa usa visa international and visa inc have entered into a loss sharing agreement and a judgment sharing agreement in the interchange litigation which became effective on july 1 2007 with certain of their members which provide that these members will be responsible for their proportionate share of the liabilities associated with the covered litigation however the loss sharing agreement provides that if we do not timely pursue and consummate an initial public offering including having completed an initial public offering before may 28 2008 the date that is 240 days after completion of the reorganization the members’ obligations under the loss sharing agreement may be suspended until we have completed an initial public offering at which point such obligations will be reinstated in full as if they had never been suspended the 240day period may be extended under certain circumstances in addition this agreement provides that the signing banks are responsible only for a proportionate amount of the liability in respect of the covered litigation equal to their membership proportion as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation because not all of visa usa’s members have signed the loss sharing agreement until the funding of the escrow account pursuant to the retrospective responsibility plan we would also need to rely upon those members’ indemnification obligations contained in visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and as agreed in their membership agreements to recover the remaining portion of any liability from visa usa’s members 

in addition if there were a final judgment against us in connection with the covered litigation or if we were to incur a judgment sharing obligation in a covered litigation before our proposed initial public offering we would have to rely upon the loss sharing agreement which only indemnifies us for a portion of the liability with respect to the covered litigation that is equal to the aggregate membership proportion of the visa usa members that sign the loss sharing agreement as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and we would have to seek indemnification from visa usa’s remaining members pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and as agreed in their membership agreements to the extent we are unable to secure indemnification from our members any portion of such a judgment not covered by our judgment sharing agreements would have to be paid by us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

if the settlements of visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion cases are not ultimately approved and we are unsuccessful in any of the various lawsuits relating to visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

visa usa and visa international are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that their currency conversion practices are or were deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in particular a trial judge in california found that the former currency conversion practices of visa usa and visa international were deceptive under california state law and ordered visa usa and visa international to require their members to disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to credit card holders the decision was reversed on appeal on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing to pursue his claims after the trial court’s decision several putative class actions were filed in california state courts challenging visa usa’s and visa international’s currency conversion practices for credit and debit cards a number of putative class actions relating to visa usa’s and visa international’s former currency conversion practices were also 

  

filed in federal court the federal actions have been coordinated or consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york the consolidated complaint alleges that the former currency conversion practices of visa usa and visa international violated federal antitrust laws 

on july 20 2006 and september 14 2006 visa usa and visa international entered into agreements settling or otherwise disposing of the federal and state actions and related matters pursuant to the settlement agreements visa usa paid approximately 100 million as part of the defendants’ settlement fund for the federal actions and will pay approximately 20 million to fund settlement of the california cases the federal court has granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreements but the settlement is subject to final approval by the court and resolution of all appeals if final approval of the settlement agreements is not granted all of the agreements resolving the federal and state actions will terminate if that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against some or all of these lawsuits we may have to pay restitution andor damages and may be required to modify our currency conversion practices the potential amount of damages andor restitution could be substantial in addition although visa usa and visa international have substantially changed the practices that were at issue in these litigations if the courts require further changes to our currency conversion and crossborder transaction practices it could materially and adversely affect our business see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—currency conversion litigation ” 

if visa usa or visa international is found liable in certain other lawsuits that have been brought against them or if we are found liable in other litigation to which we may become subject in the future we may be forced to pay substantial damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

in recent years numerous civil actions and investigations have been filed or initiated against visa usa and visa international alleging or seeking information as to violations of various competition antitrust consumer protection and other laws these actions and investigations have been filed or initiated by a variety of different parties including the us department of justice state attorneys general merchants consumers competing cardissuing companies and other plaintiffs examples of such claims which are described more fully under item 3—“ legal proceedings — other legal and regulatory proceedings ” include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 private plaintiffs often seek class action certification in cases against us particularly in cases involving merchants and consumers due to the size and scope of our business and the large number of parties that are involved in our payment system although our retrospective responsibility plan is intended to address potential monetary liabilities arising from the specific litigation described under item 3—“ legal proceedings—retrospective responsibility plan—covered litigation ” the plan does not cover other litigation that we currently face and will not cover litigation including state court litigation that we may face in the future except for cases that include claims for damages relating to the period prior to our proposed initial public offering that are transferred for pretrial proceedings or otherwise included in the interchange litigation we cannot predict whether or to what extent we will be subject to litigation liability that is not covered by our retrospective responsibility plan if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any of the proceedings described above or in any future proceedings we may be forced to pay substantial damages andor change our business practices or our pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies suggesting that we may be infringing a preexisting patent or that we need to license use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us holders of patents may pursue claims against us in the future if they believe their patents are being infringed by our product or service offerings based on our experience with such claims to date we do not believe that any such claims would prevent us from continuing to operate our payments system or market any of our significant core products and services in substantially the same or equivalent manner as we have to date 

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years as a result of litigation and litigation settlements for example as a result of the june 2003 settlement of a us merchant lawsuit against visa usa merchants are able to reject visa consumer debit cards in the united states while still accepting other visabranded cards and vice versa in addition following the final judgment entered in the litigation the us department of justice or doj brought against visa usa and visa international in 1998 as of october 2004 members of visa usa may issue certain competing payment cards since this final judgment several members of visa usa have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—department of justice antitrust case and related litigation ” 

in addition pursuant to a court order certain visa usa debit issuers may be able to terminate some parts of their agreements with us visa usa’s bylaws provided that a settlement service fee was to be paid by certain visa usa members that shifted a substantial portion of their offline debit card volume to another debit brand unless that shift was to the american express or discover brands in june 2007 a federal court ruled that the settlement service fee violated the final judgment entered in the case the doj brought against visa usa visa international and mastercard in 1998 see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—department of justice antitrust case and related litigation ” as a remedy the court ordered visa usa to repeal the settlement service fee bylaw further any visa usa debit issuer subject to the settlement 

  

service fee prior to its repeal that entered into an agreement with visa usa that includes offline debit issuance on or after june 20 2003 is now permitted to terminate that agreement provided that the issuer has entered into an agreement to issue mastercardbranded debit cards and has repaid to visa usa any unearned benefits or financial incentives under its visa usa agreement the settlement service fee bylaw was rescinded as of the effective date of the order but visa usa has appealed other aspects of the court’s decision including the contract termination portion of the court’s remedy see item 3—“ legal proceedings—other legal and regulatory proceedings—department of justice antitrust case and related litigation ” 

the developments discussed above and any future limitations on our business resulting from settlements of or judgments in pending or potential litigation could limit the fees we charge and reduce our payments volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

if we are partially or wholly unable to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets related to our litigation expenses incurred in connection with the covered litigation our financial results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 

the fiscal 2007 statement of operations of visa usa reflects a litigation provision of 27 billion associated with the settlement of the american express litigation and management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 related to the discover litigation and other matters for tax purposes the deduction related to these matters is deferred until the payments are made and thus visa usa established a deferred tax asset of 778 million related to these payments which is net of a reserve to reflect our best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized although we believe that the estimates and judgments we made in establishing our deferred tax asset and related reserves are reasonable some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in costly new compliance burdens being imposed on us and our customers and lead to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues 

we and our customers are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years examples of such regulation include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 increased regulatory focus in connection with the matters discussed above may increase our costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause a reduction in payments volume which could materially adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued our payments volume and revenues 

we and our customers are subject to regulations related to privacy and data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we could be adversely affected by these regulations for example in the united states we and our customers are subject to the banking regulators’ information safeguard rules and the federal trade commission’s rules under the grammleachbliley act the rules require that we and our customers develop implement and maintain written comprehensive information security programs containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue 

in recent years there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach in the united states a number of bills have been introduced in congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address these issues congress will likely consider data securitydata breach legislation in 2008 that if implemented could affect our customers and us in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

regulation of privacy data use and security may materially increase our costs and our customers’ costs and may decrease the number of our cards that our customers issue which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure or the failure of our customers to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions and damage to our global reputation and our brand 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular 

  

geographies for example our members in china are not permitted to issue our cards for domestic use in china governments in certain other countries have considered similar restrictions from time to time our efforts to effect change in countries where our access to the domestic payments segment is limited may not be successful which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

if government regulators determine that we are a systemically important payments system we may have to change our settlement procedures or other operations which could make it more costly to operate our business and reduce our operational flexibility 

a number of international initiatives are underway to maintain financial stability by strengthening financial infrastructure the committee on payment and settlement systems of the central banks of the group of ten countries has developed a set of core principles for “systemically important payment systems” government regulators in the united states or elsewhere may determine that we are a “systemically important payments system” and impose settlement risk management requirements on us including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for member participation and merchant access to our payments system any of these developments could make it more costly to operate our business 

our framework agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligations that could expose us to significant liabilities 

under our framework agreement with visa europe we are required to indemnify visa europe for losses resulting from any claims in the united states or anywhere else outside of visa europe’s region arising from our or their activities that relate to our payments business or the payments business of visa europe this obligation applies whether or not we or any of our related parties or agents participated in the actions that gave rise to such claims such an obligation could expose us to significant liabilities for activities over which we have little or no control these liabilities would not be covered by our retrospective responsibility plan 

business risks 

we face intense competitive pressure on customer pricing which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we generate revenues from fees we charge our customers that are based on payments volume transaction messages processed and various other services we provide in order to increase payments volume enter new market segments and expand our card base we offer incentives to customers such as upfront cash payments fee discounts credits performancebased growth incentives marketing support payments and other support such as marketing consulting and market research studies over the past several years we have increased our use of incentives such as upfront cash payments and fee discounts in many countries including the united states in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentives such pricing pressure may make the provision of certain products and services less profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenues and profitability to the extent that we continue to increase incentives to our customers we will need to further increase payments volume or the amount of services we provide in order to benefit incrementally from such arrangements and to increase revenues and profit and we may not be successful in doing so in addition we enter into longterm contracts with certain customers and continued pressure on fees could prevent us from entering into such agreements in the future on terms that we consider favorable or may require us to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships increased pricing pressure also enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives and we may not succeed in these efforts 

our operating results may suffer because of intense competition in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is intensely competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house 

  

payments in addition our payment programs compete against the cardbased payments systems of our competitors such as mastercard american express discover and privatelabel cards issued by merchants 

some of our competitors may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have or may develop better security solutions or more favorable pricing arrangements our competitors may also introduce more innovative programs and services than ours 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate closedloop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without involving intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of closedloop payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of openloop multiparty payments systems such as ours in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition these competitors have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of openloop multiparty payments systems such as ours 

we also expect that there may be changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 

  

  

  

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

our operating revenues would decline significantly if we lost one or more of our largest customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

a significant portion of our operating revenues are concentrated among our largest customers our pro forma operating revenues from our five largest customers represented approximately 12 billion or 23 and 938 million or 24 of our total pro forma operating revenues for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively in 

  

addition our pro forma operating revenues from our largest customer jpmorgan chase accounted for 454 million or 9 and 408 million or 10 of our pro forma operating revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively most of our larger customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances including in some cases on relatively short notice may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services loss of business from any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

consolidation of the banking industry could result in our losing business and may create pressure on the fees we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone substantial consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in one of our largest customers being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in a substantial loss of business in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 

continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our customers and potential customers and could increase the bargaining power of our remaining customers and potential customers this consolidation could lead financial institutions to seek greater pricing discounts or other incentives with us in addition consolidation could prompt our existing customers to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreements with us to obtain more favorable terms pressure on the fees we charge our customers caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

merchants are pursuing litigation and supporting regulatory proceedings relating to the costs associated with payment card acceptance and are negotiating incentive arrangements including pricing discounts all of which may increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our customers to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment cards we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants that are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry for instance some large merchants are bringing lawsuits against us with regard to or advocating regulation of interchange fees which may represent a significant cost that merchants pay to accept payment cards the emphasis merchants are placing on the costs associated with payment card acceptance may lead to additional regulation and litigation which would not be covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and which could impair our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we along with our customers negotiate pricing discounts and other incentive arrangements with certain large merchants to increase acceptance of our payment cards if merchants continue to consolidate we and our customers may have to increase the incentives provided to certain larger merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain financial institutions have longstanding exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do material amounts of business with them in order to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow faster than the financial institutions that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

  

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers and other third parties to deliver services and manage our payments system as a result our success and reputation are significantly dependent on the success of our customers and the quality of the services they provide if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if third parties on which we depend fail to deliver services on our behalf our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on relationships with our customers and their relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not generally solicit merchants to accept our cards and we do not establish the discount rates that merchants are charged for card acceptance which are responsibilities of acquirers as a result the success of our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our customers and the strength of our relationships with them 

outside of the united states and certain other countries most domestic as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using our payment cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our processing systems because we do not provide domestic transaction processing services in these countries do not generally have direct relationships with merchants and never have direct relationships with cardholders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage the processing of transactions involving our cards our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many countries may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the services supporting our brand 

in addition we depend on third parties to provide various services on our behalf and to the extent that any third party vendors fail to deliver services our business and reputation could be impaired 

our brands and reputation are key assets of our business and may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholders and corporate clients to visabranded products is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our company and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” which may materially and adversely impact our business adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny 

global economic political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending and crossborder travel which may materially and adversely impact our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending for example a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states and the asiapacific region where approximately 66 and 14 respectively of our pro forma revenues were generated for fiscal 2007 and 71 and 12 respectively of our pro forma revenues were generated for fiscal 2006 or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands a significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the united states results from crossborder business and leisure travel which may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions including the threat of terrorism and outbreak of diseases such as sars and avian flu in particular revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency in addition as we are principally 

  

domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of visa members we are exposed to risk of loss or insolvency if any member fails to fund its settlement obligations 

we indemnify visa members for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of a member to fund its daily settlement obligations in certain instances we indemnify members even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system the indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of the indemnification are unlimited 

while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by any of the largest visa members concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest members or several of the smaller visa members or systemic operational failures that last for more than a single day may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the amount of such payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition settlement at risk or exposure is estimated using the average daily volumes during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle and the total balance for outstanding travelers cheques our estimated settlement exposure after consideration of collateral that we require certain financial institutions to post amounted to approximately 288 billion at october 1 2007 

some visa members are composed of groups of financial institutions some of these members have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement losses arising from the failure of their constituent financial institutions in exchange for managing their constituent financial institutions in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from a constituent financial institution exceeds the limits established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently our revenues or operating results and the perception of our brands could be materially and adversely affected 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions or degradation as a result of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism or accident our visibility in the global payments industry may attract terrorists and hackers to conduct physical or computerbased attacks leading to an interruption in service increased costs or the compromise of data security additionally we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenues or profitability 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in the payments industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which could reduce our revenues and income 

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards ecommerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of 

  

technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card products and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes or by intellectual property rights of third parties our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenues 

we and our customers merchants and other third parties store cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards in addition our customers may use thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our cards reputational damage and lead to claims against us for example in january 2007 tjx companies inc a large retailer with stores in the united states canada and the united kingdom disclosed a significant security breach in connection with card and account information which exposed tens of millions of payment cards issued under our brands and our competitors’ brands to fraudulent use if we are sued in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one of our customers merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our payments volume revenues and future growth prospects finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our costs 

an increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards if fraud levels involving our cards were to rise it could lead to reputational damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or to greater regulation which could increase our compliance costs 

visa europe’s payments system operations are becoming increasingly independent from ours and if we are unable to maintain seamless interaction of our respective systems our business and the global perception of the visa brand could be impaired 

visa europe currently has a regionally controlled processing platform in june 2006 visa europe began operating an authorization system that is separate from ours and visa europe plans to begin operating a transaction clearing and settlement system that is separate from ours because we and visa europe have independent processing platforms interoperability must be maintained visa europe’s authorization system has experienced interruptions in service and it could experience further interruptions in the future to the extent that system disruptions occur it may affect our cardholders who are traveling in visa europe’s region and impair our reputation the increasingly independent payments system operations of visa europe could present certain challenges to our business because differences between the two processing systems may make it more difficult to maintain the interoperability of our respective systems in addition under the framework agreement we are restricted from requiring visa europe to implement certain changes that we may deem important unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs any of the foregoing could result in a loss of payments volume or of customers or could materially increase our costs 

  

adverse currency fluctuations could decrease revenues and increase expenses 

we conduct business globally in many foreign currencies but report our financial results in us dollars we are therefore exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because depreciation of nonus currencies against the us dollar reduces the us dollar value of the nonus dollar denominated revenues that we recognize and appreciation of nonus currencies against the us dollar increases the us dollar value of expenses that we incur that are denominated in those foreign currencies we enter into foreign currency hedging contracts to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the value of a limited number of foreign currencies and for a limited period of time typically up to one year 

some of our financial incentives to customers are recorded using estimates of our customers’ performance material changes in our customers’ performance compared to our estimates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

in certain instances we offer our customers financial incentives which are typically tied to their payments volume or transaction messages processed often under particular programs these financial incentives are typically recorded as a reduction of revenues we typically make estimates of our customers’ performance under these programs sometimes over several years in order to derive our estimates of the financial incentives that we will pay them the reduction of revenues that we record each quarter under volume and support agreements is based on these estimates material changes in our customers’ performance compared to estimates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for example if a customer performs better than expected we may be required to reduce future period revenues to account for the fact that we did not reduce revenues enough in prior periods on the other hand if a customer performs worse than expected we may conclude that we reduced revenues by too much in previous periods 

we have significant contingent liabilities for settlement payment of all issued and outstanding travelers cheques 

at september 30 2007 we had over 1 billion in contingent liabilities for settlement payment of all issued and outstanding travelers cheques approximately 35 of these travelers cheques were issued outside of the united states by a single issuer while these obligations are supported in part by a bank guarantee if the issuer were to fail to pay we would be obligated to fund partial settlement of presented travelers cheques 

risks related to our structure and organization 

the recent change to our governance structure could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships with our customers 

prior to our recent reorganization a number of visa’s key members had officers who also served on the boards of directors of visa usa visa international visa canada or the regional boards of directors of the unincorporated regions of visa ap visa lac and visa cemea as a result of our reorganization the regional boards of directors of the unincorporated regions have been eliminated and the boards of directors of visa usa and visa canada are now comprised of management and are largely administrative in nature in addition although our regions are represented on our board by six of our 17 directors the holders of our class b and class c common stock are not otherwise entitled to vote in the election of directors as a result the role of membernominated and memberelected directors in our corporate governance has been reduced as a result of the reorganization these changes could have a detrimental effect on our business relationships with members associated with a particular region in addition if a member that had an officer who also served on one of the regional boards of directors does not have an officer who currently serves on our board of directors our business relationship with that member could suffer a significant loss of revenues or payments volume attributable to such members could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our relationship with visa europe is governed by our framework agreement which gives visa europe very broad rights to operate the visa business in visa europe’s region we have limited ability to control their operations and limited recourse in the event of a breach by visa europe 

historically visa europe had been subject to the same global operating rules as visa usa visa international and visa canada these global operating rules regulate among other things interoperability of payment processing brand maintenance and investment standards for products and services risk management disputes between members and acceptance standards for merchants after the reorganization visa europe unlike visa usa visa international and visa canada did not become our subsidiary as a result visa europe is no longer subject to the same global operating rules as our subsidiaries and customers 

our relationship with visa europe is now governed by a framework agreement and a subset of operating rules that we have agreed to with visa europe and that we have limited ability to change in the future although the agreement seeks to ensure that visa europe operates in a manner that is acceptable to us the contractual arrangement is untested and may not be effective in achieving this result visa europe is responsible for designing its own plans to ensure that it is in compliance with the global rules interoperability integrity of the system and trademark usage while we have the right to request changes to these plans we have no right to audit their compliance with these requirements or examine their books and records in connection with the framework agreement or the put option the agreement provides visa europe with very broad latitude to operate the visa business and use our brands and technology within visa europe’s region and provides us limited controls over the operation of the visa business in their region visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount promoting and building the visa brand in its region and the strength of the visa global brand is contingent in part on the efforts of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe visa europe may develop among other things new brands payment processing characteristics products services risk management standards processes for resolving disputes among its members or merchant acceptance profiles that are inconsistent with the operating rules that we apply in the rest of the world 

if we want to change a global rule or require visa europe to implement certain changes that would not have a positive return for visa europe and its members then visa europe is not required to implement such rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation costs and expenses that visa europe and its members will incur as a consequence of the implementation to the extent necessary to return visa europe and its members to a neutral financial condition we cannot terminate the framework agreement even in the event of visa europe’s material uncured breach and we can only exercise our call right to purchase visa europe under extremely limited circumstances our remedies under this agreement if visa europe fails to meet its obligations are limited our inability to terminate and other features of the licenses granted under the agreement may also raise issues concerning the characterization of the licenses for purposes of determining our tax treatment with respect to entering into the licenses and receiving payments thereunder any inconsistency in the payment processing services and products that we are able to provide could negatively affect cardholders from visa europe using cards in our regions or our cardholders using cards in visa europe’s region 

we have granted to visa europe the right to require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of visa europe’s capital stock if visa europe exercises this option we will incur a substantial financial obligation in addition we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis which will impact our net income 

we have granted visa europe a put option which if exercised will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members visa europe may exercise the put option at any time following the date that is the earlier of i 365 days after the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock and ii may 30 2009 the purchase price of the visa europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that subject to certain adjustments applies the 12month forward pricetoearnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to visa europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12month period upon exercise of the put option we will be obligated subject only to regulatory approvals and other limited conditions to pay the purchase price within 

  

285 days in cash or at our option with a combination of cash and shares of our publicly tradable common stock the portion of the purchase price we will be able to pay in stock will initially be limited to the percentage of our class c series i common stock that at the settlement date remains subject to the transfer restrictions we must pay the purchase price in cash however if the settlement of the put option occurs more than three years after the completion of our proposed initial public offering 

we will incur a substantial financial obligation if visa europe exercises the put option the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other things the 12 month projected sustainable net operating income of visa europe the allocation of cost synergies the trading price of our class a common stock and our 12month forward pricetoearnings multiple in each case as determined at the time the put option is exercised we are not currently able to estimate the amount of this obligation due to the nature and number of factors involved and the range of important assumptions that would be required however depending upon visa europe’s level of sustainable profitability andor our 12month forward pricetoearnings multiple at the time of any exercise of the option the amount of this obligation could be several billion dollars or more we may need to obtain thirdparty financing either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to meet our obligation this financing may not be available to us in a sufficient amount within the required 285day period or on terms that we deem to be reasonable the payment of part of the exercise price in stock would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders moreover the acquisition of visa europe following an exercise of the put option would require us to integrate the operations of visa europe into our business which could divert the time and attention of senior management 

we recorded the put option at its fair value in our consolidated balance sheet on october 1 2007 as part of the reorganization in the future we will be required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis these adjustments will be recorded through our consolidated statements of operations which will therefore impact our reported net income and earnings per share such quarterly adjustments and their resulting impact on our reported statements of operations could be significant the existence of these charges could adversely affect our ability to raise capital andor the price at which we can raise capital 

see item 13—“ certain relationships and related transactions and director independence—relationship with visa europe—the putcall option agreement ” 

the terms of our reorganization created financial incentives that reward net revenue growth in the four quarters ended december 31 2007 

one of the terms of our reorganization plan was a “true up” mechanism designed to reallocate the shares initially distributed to the members of visa usa and visa international and the former members of visa canada among themselves based on each participating region’s relative under or overachievement of its net revenue targets during a measurement period consisting of the fourquarter period ending with and including the latest quarter for which financial statements are included in the registration statement in connection with our proposed initial public offering on the date it is declared effective by the sec we expect that the measurement period will consist of the four quarters ended december 31 2007 this mechanism creates financial incentives that reward net revenue growth in the measurement period because comparable incentives did not exist in prior periods and will not exist in future periods it is possible that the rate of revenue growth in the measurement period will not be representative of rates that may be expected in future periods 

our management team is new and does not have a history of working together 

we designated joseph w saunders as our chief executive officer and chairman of our board in may 2007 and have since assembled a new management team including john hans c morris our president and byron h pollitt our chief financial officer our success will largely depend on the ability of the new management team to work together to integrate the operations and business of visa usa visa international and visa canada and to continue to execute our business strategy because our management team does not have 

  

a significant history of working together and includes individuals recruited from outside our company they may not be able to work together effectively which could disrupt our operations and harm our business 

our recent reorganization will require us to make significant changes to our culture and business operations if we fail to make this transition successfully our business could be materially and adversely affected 

our recent reorganization will require broad and significant changes to our culture and operations historically the primary goal of visa usa visa international and visa canada has not been to maximize profit for these entities but rather to deliver benefits to their members and enhance member opportunity and revenue as a result of the reorganization we now must operate our business in a way that maximizes longterm stockholder value many of our employees have limited experience operating in a profitmaximizing business environment 

in addition the visa enterprise historically has been operated under a decentralized regional structure and each region has had substantial autonomy in its own business strategies and decisions our recent reorganization has resulted in a more centralized corporate governance structure in which our board of directors exerts centralized management control we face significant challenges integrating the operations of the different regions we may also be unable to retain and attract key employees and we may not realize the cost savings and operational efficiencies that we currently expect this transition will be subject to risks expenses and difficulties that we cannot predict and may not be capable of handling in an efficient and timely manner 

any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may make strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies if so we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any such businesses products or technologies furthermore the integration of any acquisition may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenues to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we have no present understandings commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 

our regional classes of common stock our class b common stock and our class c common stock into which our regional classes of common stock may be converted are subject to significant restrictions on transfer and ownership 

the regional classes of our common stock that were issued upon the closing of the reorganization and our class b common stock and class c common stock into which our regional classes of common stock will be converted prior to our proposed initial public offering are and will be subject to significant ownership and transfer restrictions for example subject to limited exceptions shares of our class b common stock may not be transferred until the later of three years from the date of an initial public offering or the period of time necessary to resolve the covered litigation all other regional classes of our common stock and our class c common stock may not be transferred subject to limited exceptions until the third anniversary of the date of an initial public offering during such periods except for limited exceptions holders of our regional classes of common stock and our class b common stock and class c common stock will not be able to transfer such stock to any person or entity other than affiliates of the holder or in the case of class b and class c common stock to holders of common stock of the same class of common stock 

ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock is concentrated in a few of our largest members 

our four largest stockholders own approximately 25 of our outstanding common stock this concentration of voting power could result in these stockholders having the ability to block stockholder action that other holders of our common stock may deem favorable 

  

the us internal revenue service may treat a portion of our common stock received by a member of visa international or visa usa as taxable income 

based on the opinion of our special tax counsel we believe that subject to the assumptions qualifications and limitations contained in such opinion we the members of visa international and the members of visa usa will not recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes in connection with the reorganization and the trueup except that as to a portion of any visa inc stock received in connection with the trueup a stockholder of visa inc may recognize imputed interest income if a stockholder is not a united states person for us federal income tax purposes we may be required to withhold us federal income tax at a rate of 30 of the imputed interest or if applicable at a lower treaty rate 

notwithstanding the foregoing the opinion of our special tax counsel does not apply to the extent that the fair market value of our common stock received by a member of visa international or by a member of visa usa pursuant to the reorganization and the trueup whether received on the date of closing of the reorganization or thereafter is different from the fair market value of such member’s equity interest in visa international or visa usa as the case may be immediately before the commencement of the reorganization our special tax counsel is unable to opine as to such difference because in transactions similar to the reorganization and the trueup treatment as an exchange described in section 351 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended generally applies only to the extent that a taxpayer transfers property to a corporation in exchange for stock having the same fair market value the irs might therefore take the position that the difference whether received on the date of closing of the reorganization or thereafter in the case of an excess of value received over value surrendered should not be treated for us federal income tax purposes as having been received in exchange for property as a result a member of visa international or a member of visa usa could be required to recognize income but only to the extent of the excess or shortfall of value received over value surrendered 

the shares of class b common stock that are retained by members of visa usa will be subject to dilution as a result of the establishment of the escrow account and any followon offerings of our class a common stock the proceeds of which will be used to fund additional amounts into the escrow account necessary to resolve the covered litigation 

the shares of class b common stock that are retained by visa usa members and that are not redeemed out of the proceeds of the proposed initial public offering will be subject to dilution to the extent of the initial amount of the escrow account this dilution of the shares of class b common stock will be accomplished through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock these shares will not be able to be converted into shares of class a common stock or subject to limited exceptions transferred until the later of the third anniversary of an initial public offering or the final resolution of the covered litigation the shares of class c common stock which will be held by members other than the visa usa members will not be subject to this dilutive adjustment after the completion of our proposed initial public offering and at the request of the litigation committee we expect to conduct followon offerings of our shares of class a common stock which we refer to as loss shares if the litigation committee deems it desirable to increase the escrow account the proceeds from the sale of loss shares would then be deposited in the escrow account and the shares of class b common stock would be subject to additional dilution to the extent of the loss shares through a concurrent adjustment to the conversion rate of the class b common stock because the voting power of the class b and class c common stock and the entitlement of the holders of class b common stock and class c common stock to participate in dividends or distributions upon a liquidation or winding up of visa inc is determined on an as converted basis based upon the number of shares of class a common stock into which the class b or class c common stock would be converted at the time of the vote dividend or distribution as applicable the adjustment to the conversion rate applicable to the class b common stock upon the issuance of loss shares will result in a dilution of the voting power of the class b common stock and the entitlement of holders of class b common stock to participate in dividends and distributions upon a liquidation of visa inc 

  

antitakeover provisions in our governing documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable except for limited exceptions no person may own more than 15 of our total outstanding shares on an asconverted basis or more than 15 of any class or series of our common stock unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in addition except for common stock issued to a member in connection with the reorganization or shares issuable on conversion of such common stock shares held by a member a competitor an affiliate or member of a competitor may not exceed 5 of any class of common stock in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock after the completion of our proposed initial public offering we intend to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our class a class b and class c common stock any future payment of dividends will be dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results capital requirements covenants in our debt instruments and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant furthermore no dividend may be declared or paid on any class or series of common stock unless an equivalent dividend is contemporaneously declared and paid on each other class and series of common stock if as a consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make payments of dividends on our common stock

 at september 30 2007 we owned and leased approximately 21 million square feet of office and processing center space in 30 countries around the world of which approximately 14 million square feet are owned and the remaining 700000 square feet are leased our corporate headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area and consists of four buildings that we own totaling 940000 square feet we also own a 167000 square foot office building in miami which serves as our lac regional headquarters 

in addition we operate three processing centers a processing center and an office facility in colorado totaling 268000 square feet which we own a processing center and office facility in virginia totaling 137500 square feet which we lease and an 11000 square foot leased facility in japan in july 2006 we approved a plan to replace our leased processing center in the eastern united states by building a new 140000 square foot processing center and a new 113000 square foot office building 

we believe that these facilities are suitable and adequate to support our business needs 

 

 retrospective responsibility plan 

visa usa and visa international are parties to certain legal proceedings that we refer to as the covered litigation the retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address potential liability under the covered litigation covered litigation means 

 

  

  

  

  

 upon the closing of our proposed initial public offering we intend to deposit a portion of the net proceeds from such offering as determined by the litigation committee in an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in the covered litigation will be payable we intend to use the funds in the escrow account to satisfy the settlement obligations of visa usa in the american express litigation and as described below to make payments relating to obligations of visa usa visa international and in certain instances visa inc in connection with future settlement of or judgments in covered litigation 

  

our class b and class c common stock will be issued pursuant to the conversion of our outstanding regional classes of common stock prior to our proposed initial public offering these different classes of common stock and the series into which they are divided reflect the different rights and obligations of visa financial institution members and visa europe based on the geographic region in which they are located the class b common stock that is retained by visa usa members and that is not redeemed out of the proceeds of our proposed initial public offering will be subject to dilution to the extent of the initial amount of the escrow account this dilution of the class b common stock will be accomplished through an initial adjustment to the conversion rate applicable to each share of class b common stock the class b common stock will not subject to limited exceptions be convertible into class a common stock or be transferable until the later of the third anniversary of our proposed initial public offering or the final resolution of the covered litigation although our board of directors may make exceptions to this transfer restriction after resolution of all covered litigation the class c common stock will not be subject to this dilutive adjustment 

after the completion of our proposed initial public offering and if the litigation committee so requests in order to increase the escrow account we will conduct followon offerings of our class a common stock which we refer to as loss shares the proceeds from the sale of loss shares would then be deposited in the escrow account and the class b common stock would be subject to additional dilution to the extent of the loss shares through a concurrent adjustment to the conversion rate of the class b common stock unless we or our affiliates have actually incurred a liability in respect of the covered litigation and there are insufficient funds on deposit in the escrow account at such time to fund such liability the litigation committee may not request that we sell loss shares in an underwritten offering more than twice in any 12month period and the proceeds from the requested offering must reasonably be expected to be at least 100000000 we will not offer loss shares in an amount that exceeds the number of shares of our class a common stock into which our issued and outstanding class b common stock is then convertible immediately prior to our proposed initial public offering 

any amounts remaining in the escrow account on the date on which all of the covered litigation has been resolved will be released back to us and the conversion rate of the class b common stock then outstanding will be adjusted in the holders’ favor through a formula based on the released escrow amount and the market price of our class a common stock to be issued in our proposed initial public offering 

the litigation committee has been established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among visa inc visa international visa usa and robert r hackney bruce l hammonds peter e raskind charles w scharf and john g stumpf all of whom are affiliated with or acting for certain visa usa members the litigation committee i will determine the amount of the proceeds of our proposed initial public offering to be deposited in the escrow account ii may request the sale of loss shares as described above subject to our right to delay the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement under certain circumstances and iii may recommend or refer the cash payment portion of a proposed settlement of any covered litigation to the visa usa board of directors 

the board of directors of visa usa will not be permitted to authorize any portion of a settlement of any of the covered litigation that would or might require payments out of the escrow account the sale of loss shares or the payment of cash by principal acquirer administrative cheque issuer administrative group or associate members of visa usa which we refer to collectively as specified settlement members unless such settlement has been approved by or is subject to the approval of specified settlement members we refer to such settlements as specified settlements approval of a specified settlement requires the approval of twothirds of the votes of the specified settlement members 

interchange judgment sharing agreement 

on july 1 2007 we entered into an interchange judgment sharing agreement with visa usa visa international and certain member financial institutions of visa usa in connection with the interchange litigation 

  

under the interchange judgment sharing agreement in the event that a final judgment in the interchange litigation is enforced against a signatory or there is a global settlement involving all signatories each signatory other than visa usa and visa international will pay its membership proportion as defined in the visa usa certificate of incorporation of the amount of any such final judgment that is not allocated to the conduct of mastercard under the terms of the agreement visa usa will pay the amount of such final judgment that is not allocated to the conduct of mastercard and that is not accounted for by the other signatories although it will obtain reimbursement for such payments out of the escrow account visa international has no obligation under the interchange judgment sharing agreement to share in a judgment enforced against another signatory or in a global settlement the agreement provides that visa usa and visa international will be reimbursed by the bank signatories for the full amount of any final judgment allocated to the conduct of mastercard but the bank signatories have no obligation to the other signatories with respect to the mastercard portion of a final judgment 

if we are named as a defendant in a case in the interchange litigation we have the right to join the judgment sharing agreement on the terms applicable to visa international unless a claim relates to our conduct after the reorganization other than the reorganization or our proposed initial public offering or our conduct that is not the mere continuation of conduct being challenged in the interchange litigation at the closing of the reorganization 

loss sharing agreement 

we have entered into a loss sharing agreement with visa usa visa international and visa usa members representing 61 of the visa usa aggregate membership proportion the loss sharing agreement provides for the indemnification of visa usa visa international and in certain circumstances visa inc with respect to i the amount of a final judgment paid by visa usa or visa international in the covered litigation after the operation of the interchange judgment sharing agreement plus any amounts reimbursable to the interchange judgment sharing agreement signatories or ii the damages portion of a settlement of a covered litigation that is approved as required under visa usa’s certificate of incorporation by the vote of visa usa’s members the several obligation of each bank that is a party to the loss sharing agreement will equal the amount of any final judgment enforceable against visa usa visa international or any other signatory to the interchange judgment sharing agreement or the amount of any approved settlement of a covered litigation multiplied by such bank’s thencurrent membership proportion as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation 

visa usa will be responsible for the remainder of any amounts under i and ii above after taking into account the total amounts owed by the visa usa members that are parties to the loss sharing agreement and any funds it recovers pursuant to a judgment sharing agreement such remainder amounts are subject to indemnification by visa usa members that are not parties to the loss sharing agreement as described below 

we contemplate that payments due under any covered litigation that are subject to the loss sharing agreement will be paid out of the escrow account including any additional proceeds from the sale of loss shares if funds in the escrow account are insufficient to satisfy such obligations then each visa usa member that is a party to the loss sharing agreement is required to contribute an amount equal to the unsatisfied obligation multiplied by such party’s then current membership proportion 

in order to avoid a double payment as a result of the dilutive adjustment in the conversion rate of the class b common stock upon the establishment of the escrow account we will reimburse visa usa members from the escrow account for payments made i pursuant to the interchange judgment sharing agreement in respect of covered litigation to a claimant or another party to the loss sharing agreement other than payments allocated in a final judgment or approved settlement to mastercard’s conduct or ii pursuant to the interchange judgment sharing agreement or the loss sharing agreement for certain payments made prior to our proposed initial public offering relating to the items described in the immediately preceding paragraph in the event that the escrow account contains insufficient funds to make such reimbursements all reimbursements will be made pro rata 

  

indemnification by visa usa members 

the members of visa usa have indemnification obligations with respect to the covered litigation pursuant to visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements although we currently intend to use the escrow amount including any additional proceeds from the sale of loss shares to satisfy obligations under the covered litigation before seeking to enforce these indemnification obligations 

to the extent that the initial escrow amount and any additional sale of loss shares is insufficient to fully satisfy obligations under the covered litigation and reimburse judgment sharing and loss sharing payments by visa usa’s members we will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the indemnification obligations of visa usa’s members for such excess amount including but not limited to enforcing indemnification obligations pursuant to the loss sharing agreement visa usa’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with their membership agreements 

covered litigation 

the discover litigation 

on october 4 2004 discover financial services inc filed a complaint against visa usa visa international and mastercard the complaint was filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york and was designated as a related case to the doj litigation and was assigned to the same judge who issued the doj decision described under “— other legal and regulatory proceedings — department of justice antitrust litigation and related litigation ” the complaint alleged that the implementation and enforcement of visa’s bylaw 210e and mastercard’s competitive programs policy or cpp which prohibited their respective members from issuing american express or discover cards as well as visa’s “honor all cards” rule which required merchants that accept visa cards to accept for payment every validly presented visa card and a similar mastercard rule violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act as well as california’s unfair competition act in an alleged market for general purpose card network services and an alleged market for debit card network services the complaint also challenged visa’s no surcharge rule and a similar mastercard rule under the same statutes on december 10 2004 visa usa and visa international moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim in lieu of filing its opposition papers to this motion discover filed an amended complaint on january 7 2005 in the amended complaint discover dropped some of its claims including its challenge against the no surcharge rule and its claims under california’s unfair competition law but continued to allege that the implementation and enforcement of visa usa’s bylaw 210e mastercard’s cpp and the “honor all cards” rule violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act on june 7 2007 discover filed a second amended complaint which eliminated allegations related to the “honor all cards” rule dropped attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against mastercard and visa international to conform to the court’s rulings on motions to dismiss and made technical changes to the names of the plaintiffs 

specifically discover claims that visa usa’s bylaw 210e unreasonably restrained trade by prohibiting financial institutions that were members of visa usa from issuing payment cards on the discover network in the united states discover requests that the district court apply collateral estoppel with respect to the court’s final judgment in the doj litigation and enter an order that bylaw 210e and the cpp have injured competition and caused injury to discover discover seeks treble damages in an amount to be proved at trial along with attorneys’ fees and costs on february 7 2005 visa usa and visa international moved to dismiss discover’s amended complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim on april 14 2005 the district court denied at this stage in the litigation discover’s request to give collateral estoppel effect to the findings in the doj litigation however the district court indicated that discover may refile a motion for collateral estoppel after discovery under the doctrine of collateral estoppel a court has the discretion to preclude one or more issues from being relitigated in a subsequent action if 1 the same issues were actually litigated and determined in the prior action 2 proof of those issues was necessary to reach the prior judgment and 3 the party to be estopped had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues in the prior action accordingly if the district court were to give 

  

effect to collateral estoppel on one or more issues in the future then significant elements of plaintiffs’ claims would be established thereby making it more likely that visa usa and visa international would be found liable and making the possibility of an award of damages more likely in the event all issues are subsequently decided against visa usa and visa international in dispositive motions during the course of the litigation then there is the possibility that the sole issue remaining will be whether a damage award is appropriate and if so what the amount of damages should be 

also on april 14 2005 and in subsequent rulings with respect to the alleged market for general purpose card network services the district court denied visa usa’s motion to dismiss discover’s section 1 conspiracy to restrain trade claims and section 2 monopolization attempted monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize claims that were based upon the conduct described above on october 24 2005 the court granted visa international’s motion to dismiss discover’s attempted monopolization and monopolization claims against it because plaintiffs did not allege that visa international individually had sufficient market share to maintain these claims on november 9 2005 the court denied visa usa and visa international’s motion to dismiss discover’s claims based upon effects in an alleged debit market visa usa and visa international answered the amended complaint on november 30 2005 fact discovery is complete 

at a hearing on april 25 2007 the district court set a trial date of september 9 2008 the court also established deadlines and procedures for motions practice and expert discovery on july 24 2007 discover served its expert’s report purporting to demonstrate that it had incurred substantial damages expert reports were served jointly by visa usa and visa international on october 9 2007 

in accordance with sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” visa usa recorded a litigation provision of 650 million related to the discover matter at september 30 2007

other legal and regulatory proceedings 

in addition to the matters described above we are a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unspecified damages therefore the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are not possible to ascertain at present accordingly we have not established reserves for any of these proceedings including the matters described above other than for the currency conversion litigation and the gmri inc case see “— retailers’ litigation ” and “— currency conversion litigation ” except for those matters described above under “— retrospective responsibility plan ” and below we do not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party would have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows although we believe that we have strong defenses for the litigations and regulatory proceedings described above under “— retrospective responsibility plan ” and below we could in the future incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

notwithstanding our belief if we are found liable in a large class action lawsuit or on the basis of a claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable charges we may be required to record could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent and result in a

department of justice antitrust case and related litigation 

in october 1998 the us department of justice or doj filed suit against visa usa visa international and mastercard in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that both visa usa’s and mastercard’s governance structures and policies violated us federal antitrust laws first the doj claimed that “dual governance”—the situation where an employee of a member financial institution also serves on the board of directors of visa usa or mastercard while a portion of its card portfolio is issued under the brand of the other association—was anticompetitive and acted to limit innovation within the payment card industry second the doj challenged visa usa’s bylaw 210e which prohibited visa members from issuing american express or discover cards and challenged a similar mastercard rule known as the competitive programs policy or cpp the doj alleged that visa usa’s bylaw 210e and mastercard’s cpp acted to restrain competition 

  

on october 9 2001 the district court issued an opinion upholding the legality and procompetitive nature of dual governance however the court also held that visa usa’s bylaw 210e and mastercard’s cpp constituted unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws 

on november 26 2001 the court issued a final judgment that ordered visa usa to repeal bylaw 210e and enjoined visa usa and visa international from enacting or enforcing any bylaw rule policy or practice that prohibits its issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network the final judgment also provided that from the effective date of the final judgment october 15 2004 until october 15 2006 visa usa and visa international were required to permit any issuer with which they had entered into an agreement prior to the effective date of the final judgment pursuant to which agreement the issuer committed to maintain a certain percentage of its general purpose card volume new card issuance or total number of cards in force in the united states on the visa network to terminate that agreement without penalty provided that the reason for the termination was to permit the issuer to enter into an agreement with american express or discover the final judgment imposed parallel requirements on mastercard 

visa usa and visa international appealed the judge’s ruling with respect to bylaw 210e on september 17 2003 a threejudge panel of the second circuit issued its decision upholding the district court’s decision on october 4 2004 the supreme court denied visa usa and visa international’s petition for certiorari thereby exhausting all avenues for further appeal in this case the final judgment became effective by court order on october 15 2004

on august 18 2005 the court issued an order appointing a special master to hear evidence regarding mastercard’s challenge an evidentiary hearing before the special master occurred in december 2005 in july 2006 the special master submitted his findings of fact and conclusions of law to the court in which he concluded that visa usa did not violate the final judgment in the doj action before october 15 2004—the effective date of the final judgment—but that visa usa did violate the final judgment by continuing to enforce the settlement service fee after october 15 2004 visa usa filed objections to the special master’s report and mastercard asked the court to adopt the special master’s findings and conclusions the court heard oral argument with respect to the proper scope of any remedy on april 23 2007 

  

on june 7 2007 the court issued an opinion and order holding that the settlement service fee violated the final judgment in the doj case at october 15 2004 on june 15 2007 the court issued an amended opinion and order clarifying the remedy in the ruling first the court ordered visa usa to repeal the settlement service fee bylaw second the court gave any visa usa debit issuer subject to the settlement service fee prior to its repeal that entered into an agreement that includes offline debit issuance with visa usa on or after june 20 2003 the right to terminate its agreement provided that the issuer has entered into an agreement to issue mastercard branded debit cards and the issuer repays to visa usa any unearned benefits or financial incentives under its visa usa agreement on june 13 2007 the parties entered into an agreement to toll the statute of limitations on certain potential claims mastercard may have against visa usa in connection with the settlement service fee

 overview 

this management’s discussion and analysis covers fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 and provides a review of the results of operations financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of visa usa inc and its subsidiaries and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings as well as those factors that may affect future earnings the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 

prior to the closing of the global reorganization in october 2007 visa usa along with visa international comprising the operating regions of ap lac and cemea visa canada and visa europe operated as one of five entities related by ownership and membership to visa after the reorganization visa usa visa international and visa canada became subsidiaries of visa inc a delaware stock corporation 

visa usa is a leader in the electronic payments industry in the united states and is responsible for administering visa payment programs in the united states visa usa provides products and services over a secure payments network to support payment programs offered by its member financial institutions to their consumer commercial and merchant customers visa usa’s principal product platforms include consumer credit consumer debit and cash access prepaid and commercial programs visa usa’s primary customers are its member financial institutions participating in the payments network prior to the reorganization visa usa was a regional group member of visa international and operated as a nonstock corporation with approximately 13300 member financial institutions 

visa usa achieved 22 growth in operating revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 this growth reflects a 10 increase in payments volume as defined below on visa usa’s products for the fiscal year with doubledigit payments volume growth in commercial and consumer debit products and an 11 increase in the number of transactions payments volume which is the basis for service fees and transactions which drive data processing fees are key drivers for visa usa’s business payments volume is defined as the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with visa products including pinbased debit volume and excluding cash disbursements obtained with visabranded cards balance transfers and convenience checks which visa usa refers to as cash volume 

operating revenues increased at a higher rate than underlying payments volume growth primarily due to two new acceptance fees which are included in service fees introduced in april 2007 the two new fees include a debit acceptance fee on debit payments volume and a creditcommercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume these fees supersede previously existing issuer programs used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives these changes are designed to simplify the fee structure and improve overall program efficiencies for visa usa and its issuers while continuing to support visa usa’s acceptance growth initiatives while visa usa believes that these fee changes will generate ongoing benefits visa usa does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact in 2007 of the new service fees introduced in the second half of fiscal 2007 growth in operating revenues was also attributable to adjustments from visa usa’s estimates of performance for volume and support incentive agreements as part of its regular quarterly review of these agreements 

visa usa incurred an operating loss in fiscal 2007 as a result of recording a litigation provision of 27 billion of which 19 billion was recorded in connection with the settlement of outstanding litigation with american express visa inc visa usa and visa international entered into an agreement with american express that became effective on november 9 2007 to resolve all current litigation between american express and visa usa and visa international and the related litigation between american express and five codefendant banks under the settlement agreement an initial payment of 113 billion will be made on or before march 31 2008 including 945 million from visa inc and 185 million from the five codefendant banks beginning march 31 2008 visa inc will 

  

pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million per quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion total future payments discounted at 472 over the payment term or 19 billion are reflected in the litigation provision on visa usa’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and longterm accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 visa usa intends to fund its payment obligations under the american express settlement with amounts in the escrow account in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan the remainder of the 27 billion litigation provision includes management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” related to the discover litigation and various other litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters see “ liquidity and capital resources ” and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

the effect of these litigation provisions on visa usa’s earnings was partially offset by the impacts of the introduction of new service fees during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the absence of substantial charges incurred in the prior year related to customer reimbursement for costs associated with visa usa’s holographic magnetic card impairment charges related to visa usa’s mini card license and business expenses related to a 2006 litigation settlement see “ operating revenues—service fees” and “operating expenses—administrative and other” 

in november 2006 visa usa announced plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions over the course of fiscal 2007 this action was intended to help visa usa better align personnel and contract staffing levels with fluctuating project demand as a result of this strategy visa usa reduced its total number of employees by approximately 5 of visa usa’s total workforce at december 31 2006 visa usa incurred severance and related personnel costs of approximately 13 million during fiscal 2007 associated with this program approximately 1 million in additional charges are expected in fiscal 2008 based upon current assumptions for the timing of employee terminations although visa usa believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its plan actual results may differ thereby requiring visa usa to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions at september 30 2007 the related liability in accrued compensation and benefits was 2 million 

in august 2007 visa usa completed the purchase of a parcel of land on the east coast of the united states and commenced construction of a new data center the new data center is intended to support visa usa’s technology objectives related to reliability scalability security and innovation visa usa anticipates that the data center will be completed in 2010 at an estimated total cost of 397 million see “liquidity and capital resources  ”

pricing varies and may be modified on a customerbycustomer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements in this regard volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers accordingly we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives management regularly reviews volume and support incentives and estimates of performance estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than management’s original expectation or to reflect contract amendments 

international transaction fees 

international transaction fees are assessed to customers on nonus transactions of usbased issuing financial institutions and us transactions of nonusbased issuing financial institutions international transaction fees are generally driven by crossborder payments volume which include the settlement of currency exchange activities in connection with the settlement of multicurrency transactions international transaction fees are influenced by levels of travel and the extent to which visabranded products are utilized for travel purposes these fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed

the increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 data processing fees increased 13 broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from visa usa’s debit processing services related to nonvisa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volumebased discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers of the total data processing fees 122 million or 9 was collectively earned from visa international visa canada and visa europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

  

volume and support incentives 

the decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during management’s regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of 73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 36 million in fiscal 2006 as the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly we currently expect volume and support incentives to increase substantially during fiscal 2008 due to obligations assumed upon retirement of certain issuer programs during 2007 see note 13—restricted assets and liabilities and note 19— commitments and contingencies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts amendments to contracts or new contracts entered into during 2008 

the net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows 

 

    international transaction fees 

the increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by multicurrency payments volume which increased by 10 billion or 15 during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multicurrency payments volume reflecting more crossborder transactions as overall global travel has increased 

  

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased by 127 to 50 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to 22 billion in fiscal 2006 the increase primarily reflects the 27 billion litigation provision which represented 94 of that increase excluding the litigation provision operating expenses increased 191 million or 9 

 

 personnel 

personnel expense increased 4 in fiscal 2007 due to a 26 million charge representing the first installment of a onetime special bonus program of 51 million associated with the establishment of visa inc half of the 51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007 the other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of an initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met the remaining increase of 3 reflects severance expense for certain executives annual salary adjustments which were broadly in line with economic price increases offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007 

network edp and communications 

the increase in network edp and communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following 

 

  

 advertising marketing and promotion 

the increase in advertising marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following 

 

  

 the remaining increase is attributable to additional promotional activity related to visa signature visa small business and consumer debit products these increases were offset by the absence of initial launch expenditures for visa usa’s new brand mark and card design which began in january 2006 and the “life takes visa” advertising campaign which began in february 2006 

  

visa international fees 

although visa usa’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature us economy fees paid to visa international increased due to a onetime fee waiver of 13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007 

professional and consulting fees 

professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following 

 

  

 administrative and other 

administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006 

 

  

  

 in addition after a review of claims submitted visa usa reduced the accrual for reimbursement to customers for production costs related to the discontinued use of visabranded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design by 11 million in fiscal 2007 

litigation provision 

litigation provision increased 26 billion reflecting a 19 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with american express future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted at 472 over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision the litigation provision also reflects management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” related to the discover litigation the american express and discover litigations are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account in accordance with our retrospective responsibility plan the remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters see “— liquidity and capital resources” and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

visa usa is a party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows 

 

  other income expense 

other income was 62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of 8 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in other income primarily reflects an increase in visa usa’s portion of equity earnings from visa international as a result of an increase in net income for visa international and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in visa usa’s investment portfolio from taxexempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities 

the following table sets forth the components of our other income expense for fiscal 2007 and 2006 

 

 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

the increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher visa international net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the retailers’ litigation matter interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal 2008 as a result of the american express litigation  for which accretion will be recorded beginning in october 2008 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

investment income net 

the increase in investment income net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects an increase in interest income due to a shift in the visa usa’s investment strategy from taxexempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixedincome investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year 

  

income taxes 

visa usa’s effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state statutory rates and allowable adjustments to taxable income the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23 represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35 for the prior year represented a tax expense the 23 effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year this benefit was less than would otherwise have been realized primarily as a result of an adjustment in a reserve related to litigation 

the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 

 visa usa’s fiscal 2007 statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of 27 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation this provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the american express litigation and management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of sfas no 5 related to the discover litigation and other matters for tax purposes the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of 778 million related to these payments which is net of a reserve to reflect visa usa’s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized 

minority interest 

the decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to visa usa’s plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions see note 16—workforce reduction to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements  

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

operating revenues 

operating revenues were 30 billion and 27 billion in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively reflecting an increase of 03 billion or 11 the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume and transactions both of which increased 17 during fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2006 growth in consumer credit volume continued to favorably impact operating revenues driven largely by visa signature visa usa’s premium credit platform which generates higher fees operating revenues were also impacted by growth in debit volumes and transactions processed reflecting the ongoing impact of certain member conversions to the debit interlink platform 

  

 service fees 

the increase in service fees in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 of 11 was broadly in line with the growth in underlying payments volume exclusive of pinbased debit volume which increased 1510 billion or 15 to 12 trillion in fiscal 2006 reflecting increased spending on all product platforms volumes this increase was offset by a decrease in acceptance fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting lower revenues of 36 million related to a merchant incentive program the program collects fees from customers and the funds are intended to support various merchant programs designed to build payments volume and increase product acceptance beginning in fiscal 2006 the program was modified requiring specific use of related revenues revenues related to the merchant incentive program were therefore deferred and recognized only when expended as designated for specific acceptance programs 

data processing fees 

data processing fees increased 10 primarily due to a 17 increase in the number of transactions processed in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in transactions processed outpaced the increase in data processing fees in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher volumebased discounts resulting from consolidations among financial institution customers despite solid growth in the mix of debit transactions during fiscal 2006 reflecting conversion of various member financial institutions to interlink visa usa’s pinbased debit platform the impact of volumebased discounts across all product lines outpaced the impact of growth of debit transactions of the total data processing fees 122 million and 121 million was earned from visa international visa canada and visa europe in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively 

volume and support incentives 

growth of volume and support incentives in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the execution of new agreements in support of visa usa partnership programs with existing customers and cobranding programs with existing customers and new merchants 

  

the net asset liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows 

 

    international transaction fees 

international transaction fees increased 11 while multicurrency payments volume increased 9 or 44 billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in international transaction fees was higher than the growth in multicurrency payments volume due to the differential between foreign and domestic interchange rates 

other revenues 

the increase in other revenues in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected 

 

  

 operating expenses 

total operating expenses were unchanged at 22 billion for both fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively visa usa reduced its total operating expenses as a percentage of total operating revenues to 75 in fiscal 2006 compared to 83 in fiscal 2005 due to more effective expense management and the absence of certain charges associated with visa usa’s litigation provision expense recorded in fiscal 2005 the charge to litigation provision expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the multicurrency matter that was subsequently settled in fiscal 2006 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

 

   

personnel 

the increase in personnel expense in fiscal 2006 reflected annual salary adjustments which were broadly in line with inflation and a 4 increase in the number of employees in support of various corporate initiatives at visa usa 

network edp and communications 

the decrease in network edp and communications expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected a decrease in software expense of 9 million due to visa usa lowering its threshold for capitalizing software from a unit cost greater than 25000 or an aggregate purchase cost greater than 250000 to a unit cost or aggregate purchase cost greater than 10000 

advertising marketing and promotion 

the increase in advertising marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected higher expenditures for visa usa’s new brand mark and card design launch which began in january 2006 and its “life takes visa” advertising campaign launched in february 2006 

visa international fees 

the decrease in visa international fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected reductions in visa usa’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes as global emerging markets experienced higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature us economy 

professional and consulting fees 

professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to professional contracting fees incurred to provide analysis and support for various programs and projects including product development and innovation call center operations and global processing and system development additional expenses for accounting and auditing services were incurred in conjunction with visa usa’s review of its internal controls over financial reporting and additional legal fees were incurred to support ongoing litigation matters 

administrative and other 

administrative and other expense increased in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting the following nonrecurring expenses 

 

  

  

   

litigation provision 

the decrease in the litigation provision in fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year was driven by the following 

 

  

  

 total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows 

 

 other income expense 

other expense was 8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to other income of 3 million in fiscal 2005 the decrease in other income primarily reflected the absence of a nonrecurring gainonsale of a joint venture interest in vital processing services llc a financial transaction processor for acquirers and merchants which occurred in fiscal 2005 and lower equity in earnings related to visa usa’s ownership in visa international 

 

 equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected lower visa international net income and a decrease in visa usa’s proportionate equity interest in visa international earnings from the prior year reflecting the fact that visa usa comprised a lower percentage of total payments volumebased fees paid to visa international the decrease also reflected the absence of equity in earnings from vital processing services llc following the sale of visa usa’s 50 equity interest in the joint venture during fiscal 2005 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of accretion expense on litigation for certain merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff’s class in the retailers’ litigation matter these litigation matters were settled in the first six months of fiscal 2005 see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

investment income net 

the decrease in investment income net in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of a 42 million gain on the sale of visa usa’s 50 equity interest in vital processing services llc in fiscal 2005 the decrease was offset by higher earnings on fixedincome investment securities due to higher average investment balances and higher market interest rates for current year periods compared to the prior year 

income taxes 

visa usa’s effective tax rate decreased to 35 in fiscal 2006 from 40 in fiscal 2005 the lower effective tax rate is primarily attributable to additional tax benefits granted by the state related to visa usa’s tax filing methodology in fiscal 2006 the decrease also reflects the absence of a onetime remeasurement of deferred tax assets related to the adoption of a new state tax filing methodology which occurred in 2005 

the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 

 minority interest 

in september 2005 inovant inc sold a 10 interest in inovant to visa europe and a 6 interest to visa international and its cemea region at a price equivalent to the founder’s cost thereby reducing visa usa’s ownership of inovant from 85 to 69 this increase in third party ownership had a full year impact in fiscal 2006 resulting in increased minority interest expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

visa usa maintains comprehensive cash flow forecasts to project visa usa’s shortterm and longterm liquidity needs and maintains controls and governance over spending and investment decisions visa usa’s corporate investment policy was approved by its board of directors and visa usa’s asset and liability committee oversees visa usa’s treasury activity 

visa usa requires capital resources and liquidity to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 the objectives of visa usa’s investment policy are to maintain integrity of principal to provide adequate liquidity to cover settlement contingency scenarios and operating expenditures including payments of principal and interest on its outstanding debt inclusive of settled litigation and to optimize investment income earned within acceptable risk criteria 

settlement of certain debit transactions due from customers participating in the debit processing service and due to payment networks represents visa usa’s most consistent liquidity requirement these settlement receivables are generally collected on the business day following the day in which the transactions were processed and settlement payables are typically satisfied two days following the processing day visa usa maintains a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net debit settlement during fiscal 2007 visa usa funded average daily net settlement payable balances of 62 million with the highest daily balance being 188 million during fiscal 2006 visa usa funded average daily net settlement payable balances of 62 million with the highest daily balance being 221 million visa international is visa usa’s settlement agent for credit and all other debit transactions 

sources of liquidity 

visa usa’s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash provided by operating activities and a fixedincome investment portfolio funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investment securities or longterm availableforsale investment securities based on visa usa’s estimates of when those funds will be needed at september 30 2007 september 30 2006 and september 30 2005 visa usa’s total liquid assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investment securities and longterm investment securities were 18 billion 14 billion and 11 billion respectively as reflected in the following table 

 

 on november 1 2007 visa inc visa usa and visa international entered into an agreement with american express to resolve all current litigation between american express and visa usa and visa international and the related litigation between american express and five codefendant banks under the settlement agreement an initial payment of 113 billion will be made on or before march 31 2008 including 945 million from visa inc and 185 million from the five codefendant banks beginning march 31 2008 visa inc will pay american express an additional amount of up to 70 million per quarter for 16 quarters for a maximum total of 112 billion total future payments discounted at 472 over the payment term or 

  

19 billion are reflected in the litigation provision on visa usa’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and longterm accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 visa inc expects to fund future payments under the american express settlement under its retrospective responsibility plan the plan includes an escrow arrangement in which visa inc will deposit a portion of the expected proceeds from an initial public offering as determined by the visa inc litigation committee a committee established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among visa inc visa international visa usa and the members of the committee all of whom are affiliated with or acting for certain visa usa members into an escrow account from which settlements of or judgments in covered litigation will be payable the plan also includes a loss sharing agreement in which visa usa members that are parties to the agreement are responsible for covered litigation in proportion to the member’s ownership percentage as calculated in accordance with visa usa’s certificate of incorporation this plan includes multistep mechanisms to fund financial obligations of visa usa and visa international related to certain litigation including the american express litigation covered by this settlement agreement see “ business—retrospective responsibility plan ” 

visa usa has an uncommitted credit facility with visa international whereby visa usa or visa international may provide each other shortterm financing with a maximum term of five business days neither visa usa nor visa international has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company there were no outstanding balances at september 30 2007 or september 30 2006 under this arrangement 

in july 2006 visa usa’s board of directors approved a plan to build a new data center on the east coast of the united states at an estimated cost of 397 million which visa usa plans to fund with its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows visa usa completed the land purchase and began construction in fiscal 2007 construction is expected to continue through fiscal 2010 upon completion visa usa will migrate its current east coast data center to this new facility visa usa assesses the estimated cost to build the new data center on a regular basis and the corresponding liquidity required during each stage of the building process in march 2007 visa usa executed two performance bond agreements with the county in which the east coast data center will be constructed to provide assurance that land development and construction will be completed as planned the bonds have a total value of 2 million and become due in the event that land development and construction are not completed as planned at september 30 2007 visa usa had remaining committed obligations of 186 million related to the new data center 

visa usa had negative working capital at september 30 2007 primarily due to the financial statement impact of the american express litigation see note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements visa usa believes its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows will be sufficient to fund its business operations working capital requirements capital expenditures future strategic developments and other commitments during fiscal 2008 visa usa anticipates that future increases in its operating cash flows from new acceptance fees initiated in april 2007 will be offset by obligations assumed in connection with the retirement of two restricted liability programs see note 19—commitments and contingencies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements visa usa’s ability to maintain these levels of liquidity could be adversely affected by several factors described under “ risk factors ” including the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which visa usa is a party as part of visa inc visa usa will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of its operating performance and other relevant circumstances 

visa usa has certain offbalance sheet commitments and contingencies that may have significant future cash requirements see “ offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations ” and note 12—pension postretirement and other benefits  note 14—debt  note 19—commitments and contingencies and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

  

cash flow data 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 71 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year the increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with visa usa’s visa check card program in the prior year see note 13—restricted assets and liabilities to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the increase also reflects higher noncash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 47 million during fiscal 2006 primarily due to payments on litigation matters largely accrued for in fiscal 2005 but settled and paid for in fiscal 2006 in addition lower levels of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities these decreases were offset by increases in the liability position of volume and support incentives and higher net income adjusted for noncash items 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above in addition investment securities purchasing activity net of sales and maturities was higher during fiscal 2007 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily reflects fewer funds available for the purchase of investment securities as a result of onetime litigation settlements including the multicurrency matter 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on visa usa’s series a senior secured notes due december 2007 and series b senior secured notes due december 2012 see note 14 – debt to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements cash requirements remained stable as the outstanding debt decreased during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

under visa usa’s bylaws in effect prior to the reorganization visa usa indemnified issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts travelers cheques or other instruments processed in accordance with its operating regulations visa international is visa usa’s settlement agent visa usa partially indemnifies visa international from losses due to the failure of a member the term and the amount of the indemnity is not limited visa usa is responsible for losses up to 10 million plus 003 of visa usa’s payments volume excluding interlink for the year preceding the loss or approximately 40 million in fiscal 2007 currently settlement is guaranteed by members through the indemnification provisions in the bylaws of visa usa and visa 

  

international and through separate member agreements with the individual members upon the closing of an initial public offering members will no longer indemnify visa for settlement obligations other than their own settlement obligations and those of certain other participants in the system sponsored by the member 

in conjunction with visa usa’s purchase of inovant inc from visa international on january 1 2003 visa usa agreed to indemnify visa international in the event of future tax liability in connection with an adverse determination by a taxing authority resulting from the sale of stock of inovant inc the indemnification is effective for 10 years and extends through 30 years or the statute of limitation in the event of a tax extension for the year of the stock repurchase the maximum probabilityweighted liability is considered immaterial and no liability has been accrued for this obligation 

visa usa has no special purpose entities or offbalance sheet debt other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business and reflected in the contractual obligations table below 

contractual obligations 

visa usa’s contractual commitments will have an impact on its future liquidity the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both onand offbalance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations at the end of fiscal 2007 visa usa believes that it will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and its existing cash balances 

 

          

see note 14—debt  note 19—commitments and contingencies and note 20—legal matters to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

visa usa also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and other incentive plans see note 12—pension postretirement and other benefits to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements 

related parties 

prior to the closing of the reorganization during october 2007 visa usa conducted business as a nonstock nonassessable membership corporation the principal members of visa usa were approximately 1600 financial institutions that participated directly in visa usa’s payment programs in addition there were approximately 11700 associate and participant members that participated in visa usa’s payment programs through one or more principal members 

at september 30 2007 visa usa’s board of directors was comprised of exofficio directors individuals who were also officers of various member financial institutions that are also visa usa’s customers and independent directors visa usa generated total operating revenues of approximately 903 million 808 million and 884 million from financial institutions with officers that also served on its board of directors in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 a significant portion of visa usa’s operating revenues were generated from one customer with an officer that also served on the board of directors operating revenues from this customer were 454 million or 13 408 million or 14 and 345 million or 13 of visa usa’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally operating revenues generated from a customer which did not have an officer on the board were 384 million or 11 in fiscal 2007 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of visa usa’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 see note 18—related parties to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements the loss of these customers could adversely impact visa usa’s operating revenues and operating income 

critical accounting estimates 

visa usa’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 2—significant accounting policies to the visa usa fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of visa usa’s consolidated financial statements visa usa has established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of visa usa’s current accounting policies involving significant management judgment 

  

management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate visa usa’s reported financial results as they require management’s most subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

   

   

   

 seasonality 

visa usa does not experience a pronounced seasonality in its business no individual quarter of fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005 has historically accounted for more than 30 of annual revenue 

impact of recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for the benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 visa usa expects the adoption of fin 48 on october 1 2007 will result in an increase to accumulated net income of approximately 63 million 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “ fair value measurements ” sfas 157 which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 visa usa is in the process of determining the effect if any of adopting sfas 157 on its consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “ employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r ” sfas 158 which amends fasb issued statement no 87 “ employers’ accounting for pensions ” sfas 87 and fasb issued statement no 106 “ employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions ” sfas 106 to require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet under sfas 158 

  

gains and losses prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under sfas 87 and sfas 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax effects until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost in addition sfas 158 requires that the measurement date the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets are measured be the company’s fiscal year end visa usa adopted the recognition provision of sfas 158 at september 30 2007 

visa usa adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 at october 1 2006 using the 15month approach under this approach visa usa recorded an additional 3 months of net periodic benefit cost covering the period between the previous measurement date of june 30 2006 and september 30 2006 the benefit expense of 87 million net of tax was recorded as a reduction to beginning accumulated net loss income at october 1 2006 

the effects to visa usa of applying the recognition and measurementdate provision of sfas 158 on individual line items in visa usa’s consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 are as follows 

 

 in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to sfas 115 ” sfas 159 sfas 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis under a fair value option sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after november 15 2007 visa usa is in the process of determining the effect if any of adopting sfas 159 on its consolidated financial statements 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices visa usa is exposed to two significant market risks that could affect its business including changes in interest rates and equity prices visa usa does not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

a significant portion of visa usa’s investment portfolio assets is held in fixedincome securities these assets are reflected as cash equivalents shortterm availableforsale investments and longterm availableforsale investments visa usa does not consider its cash and cash equivalents or its auction rate securities to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities or repricing characteristics of three months or less the fair value balances of visa usa’s shortterm and longterm availableforsale investments at september 30 2007 and september 30 2006 include 

 

 visa usa manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing primarily in rateadjustable or shortterm securities and a modest amount of fixed rate government agency securities to support longer term obligations however visa usa’s efforts do not provide complete assurance that it will be protected from interest rate fluctuations a sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of visa usa’s investment portfolio 

a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the fair value of the investment portfolio by approximately 7 million or 2 million respectively at september 30 2007 and approximately 12 million and 6 million respectively at september 30 2006 

equity price risk 

visa usa owns equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with visa usa’s longterm incentive and deferred compensation plans equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans for these plans employees bear the risk of market fluctuations gains and losses experienced on these equity investments are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense respectively the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense respectively by 5 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in item 7—“ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ”

at september 30 2007 the company has a note receivable from the parent for 1 which is presented as a reduction of stockholder’s equity until it is paid by the parent 

 

 on june 15 2007 the boards of directors of visa usa visa international visa canada and visa europe approved the gra an agreement that contemplates a series of transactions through which visa usa visa international visa canada and inovant will become direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company the gra contemplates that visa europe will not become a subsidiary of visa inc visa europe will enter into a series of contractual relationships that will govern its relationship and will become a stockholder of visa inc to effectuate the reorganization discussed above the company anticipates authorizing and issuing several classes of stock to the financial institution members of visa usa to eligible financial institution members of visa international affiliated with the visa asia pacific “visa ap” visa latin america caribbean “visa lac” and visa central and eastern europe middle east and africa regions “visa cemea” to the shareholders of visa canada and to financial institution members of visa europe as follows in whole numbers 

 

   

 in order to reflect relative actual performance the initial allocation of the company’s regional classes and series of common stock is subject to subsequent conversion and reallocation which is referred to as the trueup based on each participating region’s relative under or overachievement of its net revenue targets during a measurement period consisting of the fourquarter period ending with and including the latest quarter for which financial statements are included in a registration statement in connection with an initial public offering of the company’s class a common stock on the date it is declared effective by the sec as a result of the trueup each of the regional classes and series of common stock will be converted into class c common stock or in the case of the class usa common stock class b common stock prior to an initial public offering of the company’s class a common stock the shares held by visa europe are not subject to trueup 

the stock set forth above is also subject to various redemption and conversion provisions all of which are contingent upon an initial public offering of the company among other things 

putcall option agreement on visa europe shares 

as part of the gra the company agreed to enter into a putcall option agreement with visa europe under this agreement the company will grant visa europe a put option under which the company is obligated to purchase from the members of visa europe all of the share capital of visa europe at any time following the first anniversary of a successful completion of an initial public offering or 605 days after the closing date of the reorganization which is may 28 2009 upon exercise of the put option the company will be required to repurchase the shares of visa europe no later than 285 days after such exercise 

further under the call option the company will be entitled to purchase all of the share capital of visa europe from its members at any time following certain triggering dates a triggering event will occur if a there is a 25 or greater decline in the number of merchants and a 45 or greater decline in the number of automated teller machines in visa europe’s region that accept visa branded products b such rate of decline in each case is at least twice as much as both i the average rate of decline in the number of merchants and atms in the visa europe region that accept general payment cards and ii the average rate of decline in acceptance if any in the number of merchants and atms outside of visa europe’s region that accept visa branded cards and c visa europe has failed to deliver and implement a remediation plan within six months of the occurrence of such events 

the price per share at which both the call and put option are exercisable is calculated using a formula principally based on visa europe’s projected financial performance identified synergies expected to be realized upon combination of the entities and the company’s pricetoearnings ratio 

  

on the date of the reorganization the fair value of the put option is required to be recorded as a longterm liability in the company’s financial statements thereafter this liability will be carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the statement of operations similar to the treatment required by sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” and reclassified as a shortterm liability when it becomes exercisable within one year 

 

  

 in october 2007 the company completed the series of transactions under the gra as detailed in note 4 global restructuring agreement  in which visa usa visa international visa canada and inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of visa inc visa europe did not become a subsidiary of visa inc but rather remained owned and governed by its european member financial institutions and entered into a set of contractual arrangements with the company in connection with the reorganization 

the reorganization was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “ business combinations ” with visa usa deemed to be the accounting acquirer of visa canada and the remaining ownership interest in visa international and inovant not previously held the “acquired interests” the net assets underlying the acquired interests were recorded at fair value at the reorganization date with the excess purchase price over this value attributed to goodwill 

in the reorganization the company issued different classes and series of common stock reflecting the different rights and obligations of visa financial institution members and visa europe based on the geographic region in which they are located in addition to the common stock the company provided other consideration to visa europe in exchange for its ownership interest in visa international and inovant 

the company believes that the reorganization will allow it to more effectively respond to industry dynamics and enhance the company’s ability to compete 

at the time of the reorganization the allocation of the company’s common stock to each of visa ap visa cemea visa lac and visa canada collectively the “acquired regions” and visa usa collectively the “participating regions” was based on each entity’s relative contribution to the company’s projected net income estimated for fiscal 2008 after giving effect to negotiated adjustments the allocation of company common stock and other consideration conveyed to visa europe in exchange for its membership interest in visa international and its ownership interest in inovant was determined based on the fair value of each element exchanged in the reorganization 

purchase consideration 

total purchase consideration of approximately 173 billion was exchanged for the acquired interests the consideration was comprised of the following 

 

 visa inc common stock issued in exchange for the acquired regions 

the value of the purchase consideration conveyed to each of the member groups of the acquired regions was determined by valuing the underlying businesses contributed by each after giving effect to negotiated 

  

adjustments the value of the purchase consideration consisting of all outstanding shares of class canada class ap class lac and class cemea common stock was measured at june 15 2007 the “measurement date” the date at which all parties entered into the reorganization agreement and was determined to have a fair value of approximately 126 billion the company utilized two valuation methodologies to calculate the value of the contributed businesses an analysis of comparable companies and a discounted cash flow analysis under the comparable company analysis the company evaluated publicly traded companies with similar industry business model and financial profiles the most comparable company identified and therefore the most significant input into this analysis was mastercard under the discounted cash flow analysis the company applied discount rates and terminal values to the projected cash flows of the acquired regions 

visa inc common stock issued to visa europe 

visa europe remained a separate entity owned and governed by its european member banks under the terms of the reorganization visa europe exchanged its membership interest in visa international and ownership in inovant for a putcall option agreement and a framework agreement as described below and the following consideration 

 

  

 visa europe putcall option agreement 

as discussed in note 4 global restructuring agreement visa inc entered into a putcall option agreement with visa europe at the date of reorganization the fair value of the put option was approximately 346 million which was recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet the company determined that the call option has nominal value at the reorganization date as the conditions under which the call is exercisable are deemed remote 

liability under framework agreement 

the relationship between the company and visa europe subsequent to the reorganization is governed by a framework agreement which provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services 

under the trademark and technology license agreement visa inc visa usa visa international and inovant as licensors granted visa europe exclusive irrevocable and perpetual licenses to use the visa trademarks and technology intellectual property owned by the licensors and certain affiliates within the visa europe region for use in the field of financial services payments related information technology and information processing services and participation in the visa system 

the company determined that the base license fee as adjusted in future periods based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the european union approximated fair value the company made this determination through an analysis of the fee rates implied by the economics of the licenses however due to the first and second fee reduction components described below for financial accounting purposes the trademark and technology licenses represented a contract that was below fair value 

  

from october 1 2007 through november 8 2007 the fee for the licenses was payable at a rate of 6 million per quarter thereafter from november 9 2007 the date the company filed a registration statement with the united states securities and exchange commission in connection with an initial public offering of the company’s class a common stock the base license fee will be payable quarterly at an annual rate of 143 million and beginning november 9 2010 this base license fee will increase annually based on the growth of the gross domestic product of the european union 

the base license fee will be reduced by two components during the period ending october 5 2008 first during the period from november 9 2007 until october 5 2008 the annual rate of the base license fee will be reduced by an amount equal to 1146 billion multiplied by the threemonth libor rate plus 100 to 200 basis points the “libor rate” second during the period from the closing date of an initial public offering until october 5 2008 the annual rate of the base license fee will be further reduced by an amount equal to the product of the following variables i visa inc’s initial public offering price per share net of any underwriting discounts and commissions “net initial public offering price” ii the number of shares of visa inc held by visa europe other than class c series ii common stock that would have been redeemed immediately but for provisions that delay the redemption of shares held by visa europe until one year following the date of the reorganization and iii the libor rate 

the company calculated its liability to provide these licenses at below fair value to be approximately 132 million based on the company’s initial filing on november 9 2007 an assumed offering closing date on march 31 2008 and the applicable threemonth libor rate at september 30 2007 of 523 the first fee reduction component will reduce the fee payable by 81 million the second fee reduction component will further reduce the fee payable in the period march 31 2008 through october 5 2008 by approximately 51 million the assumptions used represent management’s best estimate of the future impact of these terms of the framework agreement 

fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed underlying the acquired interests based on their fair values on the date of the reorganization the excess of purchase consideration over the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation is subject to the finalization of restructuring costs and the evaluation of certain contingent liabilities 

the following table summarizes the allocation of total purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and goodwill 

 

   

the purchased intangibles and goodwill are not deductible for tax purposes substantially all of the identifiable intangible assets have an indefinite life and accordingly are not subject to amortization 

contingent consideration 

as discussed in note 4 global restructuring agreement the initial allocation of visa inc common stock is subject to a trueup mechanism in order to reflect the actual relative contribution of the participating regions to the company’s financial performance under the terms of reorganization under the guidelines of sfas no 141 to the extent the ownership interest of the visa usa member group in the company is reduced as a result of the trueup with a corresponding increase in the collective ownership interest of the other stockholders additional purchase consideration will be recorded resulting in an increase in goodwill to the extent that the ownership interest of the visa usa member group is increased as a result of the trueup with a corresponding decrease in the collective ownership interest of the other stockholders the increase will be treated as a stock dividend to visa usa members 

other contingencies 

the company has not identified any material unrecorded preacquisition contingencies where the related asset liability or impairment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated prior to the end of the oneyear purchase price allocation period if information becomes available that would indicate it is probable that such events had occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated such items will be included in the final purchase price allocation and may adjust goodwill 

pro forma results of operations 

the following visa inc pro forma results of operations for fiscal 2007 and 2006 have been prepared to give effect to the reorganization described above assuming it occurred on october 1 of each fiscal year presented 

the pro forma statements of operations are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been obtained had these events actually occurred at the beginning of the periods presented nor do they intend to be a projection of future results of operations the pro forma results of operations have been prepared from the historical audited consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and 2006 of visa usa visa international and visa canada

visa usa inc and subsidiaries 

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

actuarial assumptions 

assumptions used in the accounting for the pension and postretirement plans on a weightedaverage basis were as follows 

 

 two of the principal components of the net periodic pension calculation are the discount rate on future liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the company uses a “bond duration matching” methodology to calculate the discount rate under this approach the discount rate is determined by projecting the plans’ expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligations and by discounting those expected payments using an average of yield curves constructed based on a large population of highquality corporate bonds the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on the longterm historical risk and returns associated with each asset class within the portfolio the expected return is weighted based on the targeted allocation and results in a return rate of 75 the use of an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets may result in pension income returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on plan assets in any given year 

the expected longterm rate of return is intended to approximate the actual longterm rate of return over time the company generally holds the expected longterm rate of return constant so the pattern of income and expense recognition more closely matches the more stable pattern of services provided by employees over the life of the company’s pension obligation to determine if the expected rate of return is reasonable the company considers such factors as 

 

  

  

  

 any difference between actual and expected plan experience including asset return experience in excess of the larger of 10 of assets or liabilities is recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over the expected average future working lifetime of the current employees which is currently nine years 

  

visa usa inc and subsidiaries 

notes to consolidated financial statements—continued 

  

the assumed annual rate of future increases in per capita cost of health benefits for the postretirement plan was 8 in fiscal 2007 the rate is assumed to decrease to 6 by 2009 and remain at that level thereafter these trend rates reflect management’s expectations of future rates increasing the healthcare cost trend by 1 would increase the postretirement accumulated plan benefit obligation by 13 million and service and interest cost by 02 million decreasing the healthcare cost trend by 1 would decrease the postretirement accumulated plan benefit obligation by 12 million and the service and interest cost by 02 million 

pension plan assets 

the pension plan’s weightedaverage asset allocations at september 30 2007 and 2006 by asset category were as follows 

 

 plan assets are managed with a longterm perspective to ensure that there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit payments to participants over the life of the pension plan plan assets are managed by external investment managers investment manager performance is measured against benchmarks for each asset class on a quarterly basis an independent consultant assists management with investment manager selections and performance evaluations plan assets are broadly diversified to minimize the risk of loss the other category includes cash that is available to meet expected benefit payments and expenses

the fair value of the company’s debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues the estimated fair value of the company’s debt at september 30 2007 and 2006 after deduction of unamortized issuance costs was 417 million and 737 million respectively which differs from the carrying amounts after deduction of unamortized issuance costs of 413 million and 736 million respectively included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets

total net deferred tax asset are included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets as follows 

 

 the increase in the company’s deferred tax assets during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to the tax benefits recorded associated with the american express settlement and the recording of a liability under the guidelines of sfas no 5 related to the discover litigation and other matters for tax purposes the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus the company established a deferred tax asset of 778 million related to these payments which was net of a reserve to reflect the management’s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized see note 20 — legal matters 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences

in fiscal 2006 the company performed a historical analysis of its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of this analysis adjustments were made to deferred tax assets and liabilities the net effect of the adjustments is approximately a 33 million increase to deferred tax assets which is primarily attributable to fixed asset adjustments related to years prior to fiscal 2002

 item 11 executive compensation tableend compensation discussion and analysis 

compensation philosophy and objectives 

our global total rewards programs have been designed to support a globally consistent philosophy while accommodating regulatory cultural or practical differences in geographies we expect this approach will enable us to attract retain and motivate our employees and emphasize performancebased differentiation of compensation based on corporate and stockholder values in order to be competitively positioned to attract and retain key executives we target total compensation for executive officers including salary annual incentive target and longterm incentive value at the 50th percentile of compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers of the companies comprising our compensation peer group with actual positioning determined by individual group or company performance allowing for 75th percentile of our compensation peer group’s total compensation to reward key executive officers who demonstrate exceptional experience skills competencies and performance in addition we expect to increase the performancebased portion of an executive officer’s target pay by increasing the percentage of target pay attributable to annual and longterm incentives and decreasing the percentage of target pay attributable to base salary 

our compensation committee believes that the most effective executive compensation program is one that is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual longterm and strategic goals and that aligns executive officers’ interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance that meets or exceeds established goals with the ultimate objective of increasing stockholder value our compensation committee will evaluate both performance and compensation to ensure that we maintain our ability to attract and retain superior employees in key positions relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of our peer companies and that compensation paid to our key employees remains competitive to that end our compensation committee believes compensation provided to our executive officers should include both cash compensation and equitybased compensation 

  

role of chief executive officer in compensation decisions 

our chief executive officer will annually review the performance of each executive officer other than the chief executive officer whose performance will be reviewed by the compensation committee the conclusions reached and recommendations based on these reviews including such items as salary adjustments and annual award amounts will be presented to the compensation committee the compensation committee can exercise discretion in modifying any compensation recommendations or awards to executive officers and will approve all compensation decisions for our executive officers 

setting executive compensation 

our compensation committee will structure executive compensation to include an annual cash incentive component and a longterm equity incentive component to motivate our executive officers to achieve their business goals and reward them for achieving such goals 

we have retained towers perrin a global human resources consulting firm to conduct an annual review of our total compensation program with respect to executive compensation we will conduct an annual benchmark review of the aggregate level of our executive compensation as well as the combination of elements used to compensate our executive officers this review will be based on public information and third party surveys of executive compensation paid by publicly traded peer companies of similar size and focus including financial services processing technology and business services companies which we refer to collectively as the compensation peer group 

several criteria were used to identify the compensation peer group 1 industry—we expect that we will compete for talent with financial services processing high technology and business services companies 2 geography—to ensure that the companies identified as peers have broad international presence because we are a company with global operations and 3 financial scope—management talent should be similar to that in companies that have similar financial characteristics eg revenues market capitalization and total assets the companies currently comprising the compensation peer group are 

 

 the compensation peer group is divided into two groups for purposes of compensation benchmarking for “equivalent sized” companies revenues generally less than 30 billion we select benchmark positions that most accurately reflect the responsibilities of our executive officers for large companies revenues generally greater than 30 billion we select benchmark positions at the business unit level where available and positions with reporting levels that are generally one reporting level below comparable positions at visa and the “equivalent sized” companies in the compensation peer group 

in addition our compensation committee will take into account publicly available data relating to the compensation practices and policies of other companies within and outside our industry 

  

the compensation peer group provides a relevant benchmark of compensation levels from external sources and allows us to assess the compensation practices of our primary competitors for employees in addition the compensation peer group indicates the practices of leading organizations of comparable scope and focus and provides a benchmark for establishing corporate performance expectations for incentive programs 

a significant percentage of total compensation will be allocated to incentivebased compensation as a result of the compensation philosophy mentioned above although our compensation committee has not adopted any formal guidelines for allocating total compensation between either cash or noncash annual or longterm incentive compensation we intend to implement and maintain compensation plans that tie a substantial portion of our executives’ overall compensation to the achievement of our company goals 

we also use signon bonuses from time to time when recruiting executive officers we may agree to pay a signon bonus to make our employment offers competitive given that candidates who are currently employed at other companies frequently forfeit potential compensation by accepting employment with us 

generally prior to the completion of the reorganization we had not established standard compensation arrangements for our executive officers existing compensation arrangements vary among our named executive officers due in part to the differences among the individual agreements between those named executive officers who were historically employed by visa usa versus inovant in the case of messrs saunders pollitt and morris who have recently been recruited into the organization their compensation arrangements reflect our efforts to provide competitive compensation packages to attract a highlyqualified chief executive officer and executive officers into the organization with the requisite skills and experience to lead the organization during a time of transition further following our proposed initial public offering we intend to adopt internallyconsistent compensation programs and policies for our named executive officers our compensation committee is considering new employment agreements for each of our named executive officers 

executive compensation components 

the principal components of compensation of our executive officers are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our total compensation package is primarily weighted toward the following three components base salary annual incentive compensation and longterm incentive compensation in setting each executive’s target total compensation we benchmark his or her total compensation package as well as each component of the compensation package against our compensation peer group we do not use a formulaic approach in determining the appropriate compensation mix rather we determine each executive’s actual base salary annual incentive target and longterm incentive target by considering both the external market data and internal equity amongst our executives based on their experience and performance and the nature and scope of their roles in our organization our goal in setting the components of compensation is to provide a competitive total compensation package that balances market competitiveness to attract and retain talented employees with internal equity and provides a sufficient portion of total compensation tied to individual and corporate performance 

fiscal 2007 was a transition year for visa in addition to leading and managing our payments network business our senior executives were tasked with various responsibilities relating to our reorganization because 

  

of the transitional nature of fiscal 2007 actual annual incentive awards for messrs partridge sheedy and floum were based on their individual performance as against qualitative metrics and their actual longterm awards were based on visa usa’s achievement of corporate goals both awards were approved by the compensation committee of visa usa mr saunders’s actual annual and longterm incentive awards were determined based on the achievement of his performance measures outlined in his executive chairman letter see “—employment arrangements” 

in fiscal 2008 we anticipate that annual incentive awards will be based on the executive’s individual performance and our attainment of certain quantitative and qualitative corporate goals which we currently expect to set in february 2008 beginning in fiscal 2008 longterm incentive awards will be made in the form of equity grants with the amount of the awards based on results from the annual benchmark review a review of the appropriate mix of compensation elements the experience and performance of each executive and any employment agreement see “— employment arrangements ” actual 2008 compensation will be recommended by mr saunders our chief executive officer and approved by our compensation committee except for mr saunders whose compensation is determined and approved by our compensation committee 

in 2007 we awarded a special bonus to our named executive officers along with other eligible employees upon completion of our reorganization this was a discretionary bonus award which was in addition to each executive’s ongoing total compensation and did not impact the determination of each compensation component see “— special bonus program ” 

base salary 

the purpose of base salary is to reward demonstrated experience skills and competencies relative to the market value of the job our compensation committee approves base salaries of all of our executive officers base salaries are targeted at the median of the compensation peer group for comparable skills and experience but we allow for flexibility in salaries above or below the median based on area of expertise performance or proficiency 

during its review of base salaries for executive officers the compensation committee will consider 

 

  

  

 salary levels are typically considered annually as part of our performance review process as well as upon a promotion or other change in job responsibilities 

annual incentive programs 

our annual cash bonus programs consist of i the visa usa annual incentive plan pursuant to which bonuses were awarded in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 but which was terminated at the end of fiscal 2007 and ii the visa inc annual incentive plan which governs cash awards in fiscal 2008 and in the future 

visa usa annual incentive plan  prior to the completion of the reorganization visa usa and its majorityowned subsidiary inovant maintained annual incentive plans that provided for annual cash bonuses based on the achievement of preestablished performance targets and goals in addition to individual performance the use of preestablished performance targets and goals assisted in aligning an executive officer’s compensation with the entity’s operating and financial results however visa usa recognized that important aspects of executive officers’ contributions to visa’s success were not properly evaluated based solely on achievement of performance targets and goals especially in light of the challenges and uncertainties presented by the 

  

reorganization transactions accordingly in fiscal 2007 visa usa took into consideration an individual performance component which allowed the board of directors or committee the discretion to further adjust awards 

the maximum aggregate level of awards for all eligible employees under the visa usa annual incentive plan which we refer to as the incentive plan pool was determined based on the actual combined performance of visa usa and inovant as compared to preestablished performance goals both the performance metrics and actual results were determined on the basis of combining the metrics and results of the two entities the performance metrics weighting target performance level and actual performance results for fiscal 2007 are displayed in the following table 

 

  achievement of corporate and individual performance targets impacted the amount of the bonuses payable to visa usa executives under the 2007 visa usa incentive plan although the human resources and compensation committee of the visa usa board of directors retained discretion in determining any adjustments to these awards based on each executive officer’s individual contribution to corporate results 

the funding level of the incentive plan pool was determined by corporate results compared with the corporate targets as stated above messrs sheedy’s floum’s and partridge’s bonus payouts were based on the achievement of these corporate goals and evaluation by the human resources and compensation committee of individual performance against individual goals the human resources and compensation committee of the visa usa board of directors used discretion in determining bonus payouts relative to plan guidelines 

mr partridge’s individual performance goals for fiscal 2007 were qualitative not quantitative in nature and were not weighted they consisted of i managing inovant including with regard to system performance efficiency and customer satisfaction during the fiscal year ii managing the organizational transition management team during our reorganization including all organizational aspects of the reorganization iii leading the business negotiations regarding the framework agreement with visa europe and iv serving as chief executive officer of visa usa for a portion of the year the committee determined that mr partridge exceeded his individual performance goals and awarded him the maximum annual award of 200 of his target bonus additionally the committee used its discretion to award mr partridge an additional annual incentive plan award equal to 448000 as described in the footnotes following “— summary compensation table ” 

mr sheedy’s individual performance goals for fiscal 2007 were qualitative not quantitative in nature and were not weighted they consisted of i managing interchange strategy and merchant acceptance in the us region and ii managing the finance function during our reorganization including all finance aspects of the reorganization the committee determined that mr sheedy exceeded his individual performance goals and awarded him the maximum annual award of 200 of his target bonus 

mr floum’s individual performance goals for fiscal 2007 were qualitative not quantitative in nature and were not weighted they consisted of i managing the legal and government relations functions for the organization and ii leading certain aspects of the reorganization on behalf of visa usa including the creation of the retrospective responsibility plan relating to the covered litigation and the successful negotiation of 

  

the merger agreements the committee determined that mr floum had exceeded his individual performance goals and awarded him 175 of his target bonus the reason that messrs partridge and sheedy received awards equal to 200 of their target bonuses and mr floum received an award equal to 175 of his target bonus was principally due to their relatively more comprehensive roles in our reorganization 

visa inc annual incentive plan the visa inc incentive plan which we refer to as our annual incentive program has been designed to reward annual performance and achievement of strategic goals align employee interests with those of our stockholders and provide marketcompetitive compensation to employees on an individual employee basis the annual incentive program will be funded based on global corporate performance metrics for the fiscal year the compensation committee is currently in the process of determining the corporate performance measures the compensation committee will establish target incentives at the median of our compensation peer group consistent with local market practice and allow individual awards to be allocated based on a combination of corporate group and individual performance measures which will vary by level and scope of position performance is measured and award amounts are determined after the completion of each fiscal year at the most senior levels in the organization the measures used to determine awards will be heavily weighted toward corporate performance with a small portion dependent on either group or individual performance goals 

for our chief executive officer 80 of the annual award will depend on the visa inc corporate performance measures which will be defined by our compensation committee the remaining 20 will be determined by the compensation committee based on individual performance measures the compensation committee determined that the split of 80 corporate measures and 20 individual performance measures for the chief executive officer appropriately reflects his responsibility for the overall management of visa and correspondingly aligns his goals most closely with visa’s corporate goals for mr saunders the individual performance measures are being developed by the compensation committee more information about mr saunders’s employment arrangements can be found under “— executive compensation and director compensation tables—summary compensation table ” and “— employment arrangements ” 

for the other executive officers 70 of the annual award will be determined based on the corporate performance measures the remaining 30 will be determined by the chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee based on either group or individual performance measures the compensation committee determined that the split of 70 corporate and 30 individualgroup performance for our other executive officers appropriately reflects that each of these officers shares the primary goals and objectives of the overall corporation but also recognizes the importance of the goals that relate solely to their area of responsibility 

under the plan target incentive opportunities are expressed as a percentage of base salary based on position market pay levels and our overall compensation philosophy which emphasizes performance the 2008 target annual incentive awards for our named executive officers as defined under “ —summary compensation table ” expressed as a percentage of base salary are as follows 

 

 actual awards can range from 0 to 200 of these target awards based on actual performance results 

  

longterm incentive compensation 

prior to the reorganization cashbased longterm incentive plan or ltip awards were generally provided through plans maintained by visa usa and its majorityowned subsidiary inovant although no new cash ltip awards will be made under these longterm cash incentive plans the plans will remain in effect for the past awards that have not yet vested beginning in fiscal 2008 we intend to provide longterm incentive compensation for our employees pursuant to the visa inc 2007 equity incentive compensation plan 

visa usa longterm incentive plan  this plan is a cashbased plan in which awards vest at the end of a threeyear plan cycle at the beginning of the plan cycle each participant is granted a target award which at the end of the first year is adjusted by the human resources and compensation committee up or down from 0 to 220 based on the combined corporate performance of visa usa and inovant 

for target awards granted at the beginning of fiscal 2007 under this longterm cash incentive plan the corporate performance metrics weighting target performance level and actual performance results are the same as for the visa usa annual incentive plan described above these performance results for fiscal 2007 resulted in a 184 adjustment to target awards for messrs sheedy floum and partridge 

the target award adjusted by this performancedetermined ratio will be subject to vesting this nonvested award will be automatically deferred for the remaining two years in the plan cycle and credited to an individual account that is further credited with gains or losses from certain fidelity fund investments that the participant may select at the end of the plan cycle if the executive is still an employee the award becomes vested and payable to the participant 

visa inc 2007 equity incentive compensation plan  the visa inc 2007 equity incentive compensation plan which we refer to as the equity incentive plan was adopted to award longterm compensation following the reorganization the equity incentive plan is designed to align management interests with those of stockholders provide opportunities for wealth creation and ownership and encourage a longterm focus which we believe promotes retention 

the equity incentive plan is intended to promote our longterm success and increase stockholder value by attracting motivating and retaining our nonemployee directors officers employees and consultants and those of our subsidiaries to achieve this purpose the equity incentive plan allows the flexibility to grant or award stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock awards restricted stock units performance unit awards performance share awards cashbased awards and other equitybased awards to eligible persons covering a total of up to 59000000 shares of class a common stock 

the equity incentive plan became effective in october 2007 upon the completion of the reorganization the equity incentive plan will continue in effect until all of the common stock available under the equity incentive plan is delivered and all restrictions on those shares have lapsed unless the plan is terminated earlier by our board of directors no awards may be granted under the plan on or after 10 years from its effective date 

the compensation committee administers the equity incentive plan and determines the nonemployee directors employees and consultants that may be granted awards under the equity incentive plan the size and types of awards the terms and conditions of awards the timing of awards and the form and content of the award agreements 

it is anticipated that the initial grants made under this plan will be made in fiscal 2008 

special bonus program 

although it is not an ongoing element of our compensation plans we instituted a special broadbased bonus program for all eligible employees at the end of fiscal 2007 to reward performance during our reorganization and 

  

to encourage all of those employees to focus on the continuing operations of each business unit while at the same time preparing the organization to become a public company and achieve the anticipated benefits of the reorganization under this program messrs saunders sheedy floum and partridge each received a special cash bonus at the end of fiscal 2007 which is disclosed in the “— bonus ” column of “ —summary compensation table ” under this special bonus program all eligible employees including these executive officers are also expected to receive restricted stock with a value equal to the amount of his previous special cash bonus upon the successful completion of our proposed initial public offering subject to approval by our compensation committee if the compensation committee does not approve such restricted stock awards each such eligible employee will receive an additional cash bonus in an amount equal to his or her previous special cash bonus on the earlier of the anniversary of our proposed initial public offering or march 31 2009 

retirement and other benefits 

our benefits programs are designed to be competitive costeffective and compliant with local regulations we generally target the median of the market with flexibility to position above or below the median where local conditions dictate it is our objective to provide core benefits including medical retirement life insurance paid time off and leaves of absence to all employees and to allow for supplementary noncore benefits based on local market practice and local culture 

we sponsor a taxqualified defined benefit pension plan which we refer to as the retirement plan and a taxqualified defined contribution thrift plan which we refer to as the thrift plan to provide market driven retirement benefits to all eligible employees in the united states we have changed the design of the defined benefit plan to a cashbalance plan effective for 2008 to better align our benefits with our peer companies and the overall market in addition to the taxqualified retirement plan and the thrift plan we maintain a nonqualified excess retirement plan and a nonqualified excess thrift plan to make up for the limitations imposed on these taxqualified plans by the internal revenue code we sponsor an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan which we refer to as the deferred compensation plan which allows executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their annual incentive awards and their longterm cash incentive awards or signon bonuses to help them with tax planning and to provide competitive benefits see “ —visa retirement plan  ” “ —visa thrift plan ” and “ —nonqualified deferred compensation ” 

perquisites and other personal benefits 

we may provide executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to attract and retain qualified executive officers and to facilitate the performance of executive officers’ management responsibilities as part of our reorganization and review of our overall compensation strategy we eliminated several perquisites for our executive officers including car allowances and financial planning beginning in fiscal 2008 see footnote 8 to “— summary compensation table ” for fiscal 2008 we also have instituted a policy that allows the chief executive officer the president the chief operating officer and other key employees or their spouses as approved by the chief executive officer to use a corporate aircraft for limited personal use business priorities will always take precedence over personal usage these employees will be responsible for all income taxes related to their personal usage 

severance 

we believe that it is appropriate to provide severance pay to executives whose employment is involuntarily terminated by us without cause and in some cases voluntarily terminated by the executive for good reason to provide transition income replacement which will allow them to focus on our business priorities in some cases a severance package includes a grossup payment relating to any parachute payment excise taxes imposed on an executive the amount of severance pay is primarily determined based on competitive benchmarking of severance benefits for similarlysituated executives with comparable scope and responsibility in other companies 

  

existing severance arrangements currently vary among executive officers based on the individual agreements with the visa entity with whom they were historically employed it is our current intention that in connection with our proposed initial public offering and subject to the discretion of our board new employment agreements will be entered into with each of the named executive officers with the goal that the new agreements will have longer terms and be more internally consistent these new agreements are generally expected to provide for at least a threeyear employment period commencing immediately prior to the completion of this offering and to have such other terms as are customarily included in employment agreements including severance provisions 

see “— employment arrangements ” and “— potential payments upon termination or changeincontrol ” 

tax implications 

deductibility of executive compensation 

section 162m of the internal revenue code limits the ability of visa to deduct for tax purposes compensation over 1000000 to our principal executive officer or any one of our three highest paid executive officers other than our principal executive officer or principal financial officer who are employed by us on the last day of our taxable year unless in general the compensation is paid pursuant to a plan that is performance related nondiscretionary and has been approved by visa’s stockholders no such limitation on deductibility was applicable to fiscal 2007 compensation from awards made before our first annual meeting in 2012 under plans that existed before the closing of our proposed initial public offering will be exempt from the deduction limitations otherwise imposed by section 162m if the plan is not materially modified during this period the compensation committee will review and consider the deductibility of executive compensation under section 162m and may authorize certain payments that will be in excess of the 1000000 limitation the compensation committee believes that it needs to balance the benefits of designing awards that are taxdeductible with the need to design awards that attract retain and reward executives responsible for the success of the company

compensation committee interlocks and insider participation 

prior to the completion of the reorganization joseph w saunders our chairman and chief executive officer served as our sole director and participated in deliberations concerning executive compensation currently none of the members of the compensation committee whose names appear under “ —report of the compensation committee ” which was constituted after the completion of the reorganization is or has ever been one of our officers or employees none of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee 

  

executive compensation and director compensation tables 

summary compensation table 

the following table sets forth the total compensation earned for services rendered during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 by the named executive officers of visa inc 1 the current principal executive officer and principal financial officer 2 the principal financial officer prior to the completion of the reorganization and 3 the three other most highly compensated executive officers during fiscal 2007 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 this compensation was paid by visa usa visa international or inovant as applicable 

 

         

   

  grants of planbased awards 

 

        

the proportion of total compensation in fiscal 2007 consisting of salary and bonus is displayed in the following table however it is important to note that because fiscal 2007 represents a year in which three new named executive officers were hired and a number of changes in our compensation plans occurred as part of the reorganization the proportions may not be representative of our expected future compensation policies 

 

 pension benefits 

the table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to our named executive officers including the number of years of service credited to each executive under the visa retirement plan and the visa excess retirement plan determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the consolidated financial statements of the applicable visa entity 

 

  visa retirement plan 

under the visa retirement plan our usbased employees generally earn the right to receive certain benefits upon retirement at the normal retirement age of 65 upon early retirement on or after age 55 with 10 years of service or age 50 with 10 years of service if hired prior to october 1 2002 or upon an earlier termination of employment if vested retirement benefits are calculated as the product of 125 times the years of service multiplied by the monthly final average earnings for the last 60 consecutive months before retirement or the product of 4625 times the years of service divided by 25 years multiplied by the monthly final average earnings for the 36 highest consecutive months in the last 60 months before retirement if hired prior to october 1 2002 eligible earnings include salary overtime shift differentials special and merit awards and shortterm incentive awards the formula below provides an illustration of how the retirement benefits are calculated 

  

for employees hired prior to october 1 2002 

 

 for employees hired after september 30 2002 

 

 if the employee retires early between the age of 55 and 64 or the age of 50 and 61 if hired prior to october 1 2002 and has completed at least 10 years of service the amount of benefits is reduced for each complete year an employee begins receiving early retirement benefits before the age of 65 or the age of 62 if hired prior to october 1 2002 if the employee retires prior to becoming eligible for early or normal retirement the amount of benefits is actuarially reduced and is generally not as large as if the employee had continued employment until his or her early or normal retirement date 

the visa retirement plan will begin transitioning to cash balance benefits effective january 1 2008 under the cash balance benefit accrual formula 6 of an employee’s eligible monthly pay will be credited each month to the employee’s notional cash balance account along with interest each month on the account balance at an annualized rate equal to the 30 year us treasury bond average annual interest rate for november of the previous calendar year 

the change to a cash balance benefit formula will take effect immediately for employees hired or rehired after december 31 2007 however for employees hired before january 1 2008 and not rehired thereafter the current visa retirement plan benefit formula will be grandfathered for a threeyear period and grandfathered employees will continue to accrue benefits under their current visa retirement plan benefit formula described above their accrued benefits at december 31 2010 the last day of the grandfathered period or the date they terminate employment if earlier will be preserved after that date employees will not accrue any additional benefits under the current visa retirement plan benefit formulas and all future benefit accruals will be under the cash balance benefit formula 

currently accrued benefits under the visa retirement plan become 100 vested and nonforfeitable after three years of service 

visa excess retirement plan 

to the extent that an employee’s annual retirement income benefit under the plan exceeds the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code such excess benefit is paid from visa’s nonqualified unfunded noncontributory visa excess retirement plan the vesting provisions of and formula used to calculate the benefit payable pursuant to the visa excess retirement plan are generally the same as those of the visa retirement plan described above in which benefits are calculated without regard to the internal revenue code taxqualified plan limits and then offset for benefits paid under the qualified plan 

  

nonqualified deferred compensation 

pursuant to the visa deferred compensation plan eligible usbased employees including our executive officers may defer all or a portion of their annual or longterm cash incentive award or signon bonus in addition we have an excess thrift plan which is a nonqualified noncontributory retirement savings plan for employees who exceed the internal revenue code limits under the thrift plan in which we continue to provide the matching contribution 

 

     the table below shows the funds available under the visa deferred compensation plan and the excess thrift plan and their annual rate of return for fiscal 2007 as reported by the administrator of the plan 

 

       

visa deferred compensation plan 

under the terms of the visa deferred compensation plan participants are able to defer up to 100 of their incentives or signing bonuses if they submit a qualified deferral election benefits under the visa deferred compensation plan will be paid based on one of three distribution dates or events previously elected by the participant a immediately upon or up to five years following retirement b immediately upon or the january following termination or c optionally in january in a specific year while actively employed however upon a showing of financial hardship and receipt of approval from the plan administrators an executive officer may be allowed to access funds in his deferred compensation account earlier than his existing distribution elections benefits can be received either as a lump sum payment or in annual installments except in the case of preretirement termination in which case the participant must receive the benefit in a lump sum participants are always fully vested in their deferrals under the visa deferred compensation plan upon termination of the visa deferred compensation plan within 12 months of our “change of control” participants’ benefits under the visa deferred compensation plan will be paid immediately in a lump sum the reorganization was not considered a change of control under the visa deferred compensation plan 

visa thrift plan and visa excess thrift plan 

the visa thrift plan is a taxqualified 401k retirement savings plan pursuant to which all us employees of visa are able to contribute the lesser of up to 50 or 13 for highly compensated employees of their covered pay base salary plus onehalf of any sales commissions up to the limit prescribed by the internal revenue service to the visa thrift plan on a pretax basis employees also have the option of contribution on an aftertax basis from 1 up to 50 or 13 for highly compensated employees of salary or a combination of pretax and after tax contributions that do not exceed 50 or 13 for highly compensated employees of salary and internal revenue code limits the maximum pretax amount an employee may contribute to the visa thrift plan annually is restricted by the internal revenue code if an employee reaches this limit during the calendar year an employee may continue to make contributions to the visa thrift plan on an aftertax basis 

we will match 200 of the first 3 of pay that is contributed to the visa thrift plan or 300 of the first 3 of pay if the employee has at least 10 years of service with visa all employee contributions to the visa thrift plan are fully vested upon contribution and the matching contributions vest incrementally over three years 20 after one year 40 after two years and 100 after three years 

because the internal revenue code limits the maximum amount a company and an employee can contribute to an employee’s thrift plan account each year we continue to provide the matching contribution after the applicable internal revenue code limits are reached to the visa excess thrift plan which is a nonqualified noncontributory retirement savings plan employees are eligible to participate in the visa excess thrift plan if their covered pay is greater than the internal revenue code pay cap or if the total of their contributions and visa usa or inovant’s matching contributions to the visa thrift plan exceed the internal revenue code benefit limit the features of the visa excess thrift plan are generally the same as under the visa thrift plan except benefits cannot be rolled over to an ira or another employer’s qualified plan 

employment arrangements 

set forth below is a description of the employment arrangements that currently exist between us and each of our named executive officers these historic arrangements vary among the executives based on the individual agreement with the visa entity with which each named executive officer was historically employed and in the case of mr saunders based on the circumstances under which he transitioned into his position as chairman and chief executive officer as described below it is our current intention that in connection with our proposed initial public offering and subject to the discretion of our board new employment agreements will be entered into with each of the named executive officers with the goal that the new agreements will have longer terms and be more internally consistent these new agreements are generally expected to provide for at least a threeyear employment period commencing immediately prior to the completion of this offering and to have such other terms as are customarily included in employment agreements including severance provisions
