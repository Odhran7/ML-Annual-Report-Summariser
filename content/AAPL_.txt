apple inc  2022 form 10k  2 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories and services the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and service offerings with large customer bases in addition some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss the company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer 

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the us and ireland

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business reputation results of operations financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including those described below when any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time the company’s business reputation results of operations financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s results of operations and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods this discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements 

this section should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company has international operations with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales in addition the company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the company’s supplier facilities including manufacturing and assembly sites are located outside the us as a result the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values energy shortages and cost increases labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors 

in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company’s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the company’s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company’s products and insolvency 

a downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company’s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company’s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company’s financial instruments these and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price 

the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

covid19 has had and continues to have a significant impact around the world prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations temporary closures of businesses and quarantine and shelterinplace orders the covid19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets 

the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price during the course of the pandemic certain of the company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide and similar disruptions could occur in the future public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the company’s products and services in affected areas 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  5 

the company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact the company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company’s control including the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the emergence of new variants the development availability distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services additional future impacts on the company may include material adverse effects on demand for the company’s products and services the company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels the company’s ability to execute its strategic plans and the company’s profitability and cost structure 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this part i item 1a of this form 10k 

the company’s business can be impacted by political events trade and other international disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions 

political events trade and other international disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners 

the company has a large global business with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales and the company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia including china mainland india japan south korea taiwan and vietnam trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade and can materially adversely affect the company’s business particularly if these measures occur in regions where the company derives a significant portion of its revenues andor has significant supply chain operations for example tensions between the us and china have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the us on imports from china mainland as well as other business restrictions tariffs increase the cost of the company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs can also make the company’s products more expensive for customers which could make the company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other measures such as controls on imports or exports of goods technology or data that could adversely impact the company’s operations and supply chain and limit the company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed these measures can require the company to take various actions including changing suppliers restructuring business relationships and ceasing to offer thirdparty applications on its platforms changing the company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive timeconsuming and disruptive to the company’s operations such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures if disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the company’s business political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company’s business 

many of the company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks labor disputes public health issues including pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and other events beyond the company’s control global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events can make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company can require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  6 

the company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life disruption to the company’s business and harm to the company’s reputation major public health issues including pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products the imposition of protective public safety measures such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions and disruptions in the company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd there can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully 

the company currently holds a significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register additional patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by imitating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the company operates if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected 

the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall 

additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions 

the company’s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications 

the company’s business results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  7 

business risks 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including timely and successful development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production rampup issues the availability of application software for the company’s products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia including china mainland india japan south korea taiwan and vietnam and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations changes or additions to the company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided or adversely affect the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and outofwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies on singlesource outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes armed conflict economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms 

because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition for example the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply which has adversely affected and could materially adversely affect the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition ” above can also affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  8 

the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements when the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s business results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 

the company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company’s business and result in harm to the company’s reputation 

the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company’s products are introduced into specialized applications including health in addition the company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company’s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company’s products and services in addition the company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory property plant and equipment andor intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company’s products and services and result in harm to the company’s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales 

the company is exposed to the risk of writedowns on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable there can be no assurance the company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties in addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice the company believes licenses to such thirdparty intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms can preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  9 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there can be no assurance thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets windows for personal computers and tablets and playstation nintendo and xbox for gaming platforms this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services 

the company’s minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share when developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices can suffer 

the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and when thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers 

the company distributes thirdparty applications for its products through the app store for the vast majority of applications developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store the company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application from time to time the company has made changes to its app store including actions taken in response to competition market and legal conditions the company may make further business changes in the future new legislative initiatives such as the european union “eu” digital markets act could require further changes the company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the app store which have resulted in changes to the company’s business practices and may in the future result in further changes these changes could include how and to what extent the company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the app store this could reduce the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the company’s customers or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell or offer subscriptions to thirdparty content as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the company’s own services the licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules 

the company also produces its own digital content which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent content and subscribers and may fail to appeal to the company’s customers the covid19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content

the company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees including key personnel and the company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture 

much of the company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located in addition to intense competition for talent workforce dynamics are constantly evolving if the company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively it could materially adversely affect the company’s culture reputation and operational flexibility 

the company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success if the company is unable to nurture its culture it could materially adversely affect the company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success and could otherwise materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of which distribute products and services from competitors the company also sells its products and services and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force 

some carriers providing cellular network service for the company’s products offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device there can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts 

the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

the company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions 

the company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company’s business by among other things preventing access to the company’s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products these events could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personal information could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including personal information with respect to the company’s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties the company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the company’s behalf such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  11 

the company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis these attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations and could among other things impair the company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company’s stock price materially damage commercial relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company globally attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls avoid detection and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence all of which hinders the company’s ability to identify investigate and recover from incidents in addition attacks against the company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict 

although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including personal information affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes 

the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking ransomware attacks employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties can fraudulently induce the company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which can in turn be used for unauthorized access to the company’s or its vendors’ systems and services to help protect customers and the company the company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and services 

while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greaterthanexpected liabilities and expenses economic political legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses regions or countries inadequate return on capital potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and significant writeoffs investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the covid19 pandemic could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

the company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations and financial condition including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include the company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  12 

legal and regulatory compliance risks 

the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations 

the company is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new matters may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party the number of claims legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company and the alleged magnitude of such claims proceedings and government investigations has generally increased over time and may continue to increase 

the company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several us jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the merit of particular claims defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive timeconsuming and disruptive to the company’s operations in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements can also significantly increase the company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the company to change its business practices and limit the company’s ability to offer certain products and services 

except as described in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims 

the outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome can result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company and can require the company to change its business practices and limit the company’s ability to offer certain products and services all of which could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

the company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide which exposes the company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects on the company’s business 

the company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust privacy data security and data localization consumer protection advertising sales billing and ecommerce financial services and technology product liability intellectual property ownership and infringement digital platforms internet telecommunications and mobile communications media television film and digital content availability of thirdparty software applications and services labor and employment anticorruption import export and trade foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anti–money laundering foreign ownership and investment tax and environmental health and safety including electronic waste recycling and climate change 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  13 

compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive new and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the company’s business by increasing the company’s costs limiting the company’s ability to offer a product service or feature to customers impacting customer demand for the company’s products and services and requiring changes to the company’s supply chain and its business new and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied these risks and costs may increase as the company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications including health and financial services the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures if the company is found to have violated laws and regulations it could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures for example the company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products although the company has programs policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation as a result the company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation either of which could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

expectations relating to environmental social and governance considerations expose the company to potential liabilities increased costs reputational harm and other adverse effects on the company’s business 

many governments regulators investors employees customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental social and governance considerations relating to businesses including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions human and civil rights and diversity equity and inclusion in addition the company makes statements about its environmental social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental social and governance report its other nonfinancial reports information provided on its website press statements and other communications responding to these environmental social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties requires investments and depends in part on thirdparty performance or data that is outside the company’s control the company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental social and governance goals and initiatives in addition some stakeholders may disagree with the company’s goals and initiatives any failure or perceived failure by the company to achieve its goals further its initiatives adhere to its public statements comply with federal state or international environmental social and governance laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the company and materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations financial condition and stock price 

the technology industry including in some instances the company is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which exposes the company to increasing regulation government investigations legal actions and penalties 

from time to time the company has made changes to its app store including actions taken in response to competition market and legal conditions the company may make further business changes in the future new legislative initiatives such as the eu digital markets act or similar laws in other jurisdictions could require further changes these changes could include how and to what extent the company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the app store 

the company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition for example the company is the subject of investigations in europe and other jurisdictions relating to app store terms and conditions if such investigations result in adverse findings against the company the company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its app store business all of which could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company is also subject to litigation relating to the app store which has resulted in changes to the company’s business practices and may in the future result in further changes 

further the company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that if resolved against those other companies could materially adversely affect the company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition for example the company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the company’s platforms and apps and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  14 

there can be no assurance the company’s business will not be materially adversely affected individually or in the aggregate by the outcomes of such investigations litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future changes to the company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the company’s products and services and result in harm to the company’s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services and lost sales 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of various types of personal information in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also restrict transfers of personal information among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability 

the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy information provided on its website press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability 

in addition to the risks generally relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personal information the company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws such as health data financial data and biometric data health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company’s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions the company can be subject to litigation or government investigations and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines 

payment card data is also subject to additional requirements under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

financial risks 

the company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example the gross margins on the company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time the company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industrywide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures increased competition the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services compressed product life cycles supply shortages potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and developing acquiring and delivering content for the company’s services the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix including to the extent that regulatory changes require the company to modify its product and service offerings fluctuations in foreign exchange rates inflation and other macroeconomic pressures and the introduction of new products or services including new products or services with higher cost structures these and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses further the company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  15 

the company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–us dollar–denominated sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the us dollar’s strengthening which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales 

conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio 

the company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable and nonmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable and nonmarketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products and certain of its services through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products and services directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance and a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers the company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 24 2022 the company’s vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company is subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the introduction of new taxes or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the us and ireland the application of tax laws may be uncertain require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  16 

the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the us or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

general risks 

the price of the company’s stock is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have from time to time experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance price volatility may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time the company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company’s board of directors and the company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations the price of the company’s stock may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention

critical accounting estimates

uncertain tax positions 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the evaluation of the company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws including the act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries although management believes the company’s reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the company’s reserves reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax examination resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations it is most affected by fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 24 2022 and september 25 2021 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 40 billion and 41 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of september 24 2022 the company had outstanding fixedrate notes and as of september 25 2021 the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1101 billion and 1187 billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 24 2022 and september 25 2021 to increase by 201 million and 186 million on an annualized basis respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

apple inc  2022 form 10k  26 

to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 10 billion as of september 24 2022 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 550 million as of september 25 2021 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 24 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations

the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the company’s business results of operations and financial condition as well as the price of the company’s stock during the course of the pandemic certain of the company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide and similar disruptions could occur in the future the company’s retail stores as well as channel partner points of sale have been temporarily closed at various times in many cases as stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers the company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely 

the company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact the company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company’s control including the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the emergence of new variants the development availability distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products additional future impacts on the company may include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for the company’s products and services the company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels the company’s ability to execute its strategic plans and the company’s profitability and cost structure 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this part i item 1a of this form 10k 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company has international operations with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales in addition the company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the company’s supplier facilities including manufacturing and assembly sites are located outside the us as a result the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors

in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company’s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the company’s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company’s products and insolvency 

a downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company’s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company’s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company’s financial instruments these and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s business can be impacted by political events trade and other international disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions 

political events trade and other international disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners 

the company has a large global business and the company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the company’s business for example tensions between the us and china have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the us on imports from china mainland as well as other business restrictions tariffs increase the cost of the company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs can also make the company’s products more expensive for customers which could make the company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other measures such as controls on imports or exports of goods technology or data that could adversely impact the company’s operations and supply chain and limit the company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed these measures can require the company to take various actions including changing suppliers restructuring business relationships and ceasing to offer thirdparty applications on its platforms changing the company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company’s business 

many of the company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks labor disputes public health issues including pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and other events beyond the company’s control global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events can make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company can require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company 

the company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company’s business and harm to the company’s reputation major public health issues including pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products the imposition of protective public safety measures such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions and disruptions in the company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd there can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully 

the company currently holds a significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register additional patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by imitating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the company operates if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall 

additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions 

the company’s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications 

the company’s business results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

business risks 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including timely and successful development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production rampup issues the availability of application software for the company’s products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided or adversely affect the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and outofwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product defect liability from time to time while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies on singlesource outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms 

because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition for example the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply which has adversely affected and could materially adversely affect the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition ” above can also affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements when the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s business results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source

the company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company’s business and result in harm to the company’s reputation 

the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company’s products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company’s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company’s products and services in addition the company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory property plant and equipment andor intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company’s products and services and result in harm to the company’s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales 

the company is exposed to the risk of writedowns on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable there can be no assurance the company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties in addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice the company believes licenses to such thirdparty intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms can preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there can be no assurance thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets windows for personal computers and tablets and playstation nintendo and xbox for gaming platforms this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services 

apple inc  2021 form 10k  10 

the company’s minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share when developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices can suffer 

the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and when thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers 

the company distributes thirdparty applications for its products through the app store for the vast majority of applications developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store the company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application from time to time the company has made changes to its app store including actions taken in response to competition market and legal conditions the company may make further business changes in the future new legislative initiatives such as the proposed european union “eu” digital markets act could if enacted require further changes the company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the app store which have resulted in changes to the company’s business practices and may in the future result in further changes these changes could include how and to what extent the company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the app store this could reduce the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the company’s customers or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell or offer subscriptions to thirdparty content as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the company’s own services the licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules 

the company also produces its own digital content which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent content and subscribers and may fail to appeal to the company’s customers the covid19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there can be no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner 

the company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees including key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located the company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success if the company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture it could adversely affect the company’s ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees and materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force 

some carriers providing cellular network service for the company’s products offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device there can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts 

apple inc  2021 form 10k  11 

the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

the company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions 

the company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company’s business by among other things preventing access to the company’s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products these events could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personal information could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including personal information with respect to the company’s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties the company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the company’s behalf such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis these attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations and could among other things impair the company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the price of the company’s stock materially damage commercial relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company globally attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls avoid detection and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence all of which hinders the company’s ability to identify investigate and recover from incidents 

although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including personal information affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes 

the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking ransomware attacks employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties can fraudulently induce the company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which can in turn be used for unauthorized access to the company’s or its vendors’ systems and services to help protect customers and the company the company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and services 

while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greaterthanexpected liabilities and expenses economic political legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses regions or countries inadequate return on capital potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and significant writeoffs investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the covid19 pandemic could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

the company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations and financial condition including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include the company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

legal and regulatory compliance risks 

the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations 

the company is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new matters may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party the number of claims legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company and the alleged magnitude of such claims proceedings and government investigations has generally increased over time and may continue to increase 

the company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several us jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the merit of particular claims defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements can also significantly increase the company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the company to change its business practices and limit the company’s ability to offer certain products and services 

except as described in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims 

apple inc  2021 form 10k  13 

the outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome can result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company and can require the company to change its business practices and limit the company’s ability to offer certain products and services all of which could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

the company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide which exposes the company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects on the company’s business 

the company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust privacy data security and data localization consumer protection advertising sales billing and ecommerce product liability intellectual property ownership and infringement digital platforms internet telecommunications and mobile communications media television film and digital content availability of thirdparty software applications and services labor and employment anticorruption import export and trade foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anti–money laundering foreign ownership and investment tax and environmental health and safety including electronic waste recycling and climate change 

compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive increasing the cost of conducting the company’s global operations changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the company’s business by increasing the company’s costs limiting the company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers requiring changes to the company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the company’s products and services less attractive to customers the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures if the company is found to have violated laws and regulations it could materially adversely affect the company’s business reputation results of operations and financial condition regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures 

the technology industry including in some instances the company is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which exposes the company to increasing regulation government investigations legal actions and penalties 

from time to time the company has made changes to its app store including actions taken in response to competition market and legal conditions the company may make further business changes in the future new legislative initiatives such as the proposed eu digital markets act could if enacted require further changes these changes could include how and to what extent the company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the app store 

the company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition for example the company is the subject of investigations in europe and other jurisdictions relating to app store terms and conditions if such investigations result in adverse findings against the company the company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its app store business all of which could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition the company is also subject to litigation relating to the app store which has resulted in changes to the company’s business practices and may in the future result in further changes

in addition to the risks generally relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personal information the company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws such as health data financial data and biometric data health data is subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company’s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company’s agreements with healthcare institutions the company can be subject to litigation or government investigations and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines

financial risks 

the company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example the gross margins on the company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time the company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industrywide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures increased competition the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services compressed product life cycles potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and developing acquiring and delivering content for the company’s services the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix including to the extent that regulatory changes require the company to modify its product and service offerings fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the introduction of new products or services including new products or services with higher cost structures these and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses further the company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners

apple inc  2021 form 10k  15 

the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the us dollar’s strengthening which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales 

conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place

the company is subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities

critical accounting estimates

uncertain tax positions 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the evaluation of the company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws including the act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries although management believes the company’s reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the company’s reserves reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

apple inc  2021 form 10k  25 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 25 2021 and september 26 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 41 billion and 31 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of september 25 2021 and september 26 2020 the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1187 billion and 1074 billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 25 2021 and september 26 2020 to increase by 186 million and 218 million on an annualized basis respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

apple inc  2021 form 10k  26 

to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 550 million as of september 25 2021 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 551 million as of september 26 2020 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 25 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  2 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices and services the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and service offerings with large customer bases in addition some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss the company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer 

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the us and ireland 

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development “rd” licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology 

intellectual property 

the company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the us and various foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

in addition to companyowned intellectual property many of the company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company’s products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  3 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction 

employees 

as of september 26 2020 the company had approximately 147000 fulltime equivalent employees

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition operating results and stock price 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

covid19 has spread rapidly throughout the world prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations temporary closures of businesses and quarantines and shelterinplace orders the covid19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets 

the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price following the initial outbreak of the virus the company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners resulting in temporary iphone supply shortages that affected sales worldwide during the course of the pandemic the company’s retail stores as well as channel partner points of sale have been temporarily closed at various times in many cases where stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers the company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely 

the company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company’s control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products additional future impacts on the company may include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for the company’s products and services the company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels the company’s ability to execute its strategic plans and the company’s profitability and cost structure 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects the company’s business results of operations financial condition and stock price it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this part i item 1a of this form 10k 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth 

the company has international operations with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales in addition a majority of the company’s supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the us as a result the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  5 

in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company’s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company’s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company’s products and insolvency 

a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company’s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company’s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company’s financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully 

the company currently holds a significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available in every country in which the company operates if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall 

additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions 

the company’s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications 

the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  6 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force 

some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

the company is exposed to the risk of writedowns on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  7 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms 

because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth ” above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and outofwarranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on singlesource outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted

the company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company’s business and result in harm to the company’s reputation

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available content the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make thirdparty digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services 

the company’s minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices may suffer 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  9 

the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers 

the company sells and delivers thirdparty applications for its products through the app store for the vast majority of applications developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store the company only retains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers purchases for digital features services or goods within an application if developers reduce their use of the company’s platforms including inapp purchases then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties in addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice the company believes licenses to such thirdparty intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations 

the company is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new matters may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party the number of claims legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company and the alleged magnitude of such claims proceedings and government investigations has generally increased over time and may continue to increase 

the company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several us jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the merit of particular claims defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company’s cost of sales and operating expenses 

except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights 

the outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company and could require the company to change its business practices or limit the company’s ability to offer certain products and services all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise

the technology industry including in some instances the company is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties for example the company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results in addition if enacted legislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the company’s business including requiring the company to modify its product and service offerings limiting the company’s ability to invest in strategic acquisitions or affecting the company’s business relationships with other technology companies and could have a materially adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results further the company’s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that if resolved against them could affect the company’s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be materially adversely affected individually or in the aggregate by the outcomes of such investigations litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future 

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the covid19 pandemic could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

the company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company’s business by among other things preventing access to the company’s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products these events could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information “pii” with respect to the company’s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

the company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company’s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company 

although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes 

the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and services 

in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data is subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company’s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company’s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines 

under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  12 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability 

the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability

the company’s business can be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions 

political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners 

the company has a large global business and the company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade international trade disputes can result in tariffs sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the company’s business for example tensions between the us and china have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the us on imports from china mainland as well as other business restrictions tariffs may increase the cost of the company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs can also make the company’s products more expensive for customers which could make the company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other measures such as controls on imports or exports of goods technology or data that could adversely impact the company’s operations and supply chain and limit the company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed these measures can require the company to take various actions including change suppliers restructure business relationships and stop offering thirdparty applications on its platforms changing the company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company’s business 

many of the company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues including pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and other events beyond the company’s control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  13 

the company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company’s business and harm to the company’s reputation major public health issues including pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products the imposition of protective public safety measures such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions and disruptions in the company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise 

the company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example the gross margins on the company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time the company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industrywide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures increased competition the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services compressed product life cycles potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and developing acquiring and delivering content for the company’s services the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the introduction of new products or services including new products or services with higher cost structures these and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses further the company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company’s board of directors and the company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 

the company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–us dollar–denominated sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the us dollar’s strengthening which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  14 

conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio 

the company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable and nonmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable and nonmarketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance and a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers the company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 26 2020 the company’s vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the introduction of new taxes or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the us and ireland

other noncurrent liabilities 

the company’s remaining other noncurrent liabilities primarily consist of items for which the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services which include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices “ssps” because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company’s estimated ssps revenue allocated to the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided 

the company’s process for determining estimated ssps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s ssps and the future rate of related amortization for productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the nature of the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided 

valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company invests in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm agreements to secure the supply of inventory the company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturingrelated assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record writedowns or impairments of manufacturingrelated assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  27 

warranty costs 

the company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products and customers may purchase extended service coverage where available on many of the company’s hardware products the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the company’s typical experience if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required 

income taxes 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greaterthan50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 26 2020 and september 28 2019 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 31 billion and 28 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

apple inc  2020 form 10k  28 

as of september 26 2020 and september 28 2019 the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1074 billion and 1021 billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 26 2020 and september 28 2019 to increase by 218 million and 325 million on an annualized basis respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 551 million as of september 26 2020 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 452 million as of september 28 2019 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 26 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices many of the company’s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate features of the company’s products and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications 

the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including hardware software and services some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the us and ireland 

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development “rd” licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology 

intellectual property 

the company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the us and various foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

in addition to companyowned intellectual property many of the company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company’s products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction 

employees 

as of september 28 2019  the company had approximately 137000 fulltime equivalent employees

risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition operating results and stock price 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth  

the company has international operations with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales in addition a majority of the company’s supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the us as a result the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors 

in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company’s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company’s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company’s products and insolvency 

a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company’s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company’s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company’s financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully 

the company currently holds a significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  5 

the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss 

additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions 

some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted in addition an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the company’s existing products 

the company’s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications 

the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force 

some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  6 

the company is exposed to the risk of writedowns on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days  because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms 

because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth ” above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and outofwarranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on singlesource outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  7 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted 

the company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company’s business and result in harm to the company’s reputation 

the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company’s products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company’s products and services in addition the company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory property plant and equipment andor intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company’s products and services and result in harm to the company’s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales 

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available content the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make thirdparty digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  8 

the company’s minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices may suffer 

the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers 

the company sells and delivers thirdparty applications for its products through the app store mac app store tv app store and watch app store the company retains a commission from sales through these platforms if developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer inapp purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties in addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice the company believes licenses to such thirdparty intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights  

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party 

claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several us jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation can be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company’s cost of sales and operating expenses 

except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  9 

the company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide which exposes the company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects on the company’s business 

the company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including but not limited to antitrust privacy data security and data localization consumer protection advertising sales billing and ecommerce product liability intellectual property ownership and infringement digital platforms internet telecommunications and mobile communications media television film and digital content availability of thirdparty software applications and services labor and employment anticorruption import export and trade foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions anti–money laundering foreign ownership and investment tax and environmental health and safety 

compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive increasing the cost of conducting the company’s global operations changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the company’s business by increasing the company’s costs limiting the company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers requiring changes to the company’s business practices or otherwise making the company’s products and services less attractive to customers the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures if the company is found to have violated laws and regulations it could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

the technology industry including in some instances the company is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties for example the company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results there can be no assurance that the company’s business will not be materially adversely affected individually or in the aggregate by the outcomes of such investigations or changes to laws and regulations in the future 

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

the company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greaterthanexpected liabilities and expenses inadequate return on capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company’s business by among other things preventing access to the company’s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products these events could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  10 

there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information “pii” with respect to the company’s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results

although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes 

the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and services

many of the company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the company’s control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company 

the company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company’s business and harm to the company’s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses further the company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–us dollar–denominated sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the us dollar’s strengthening which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales 

conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place

other noncurrent liabilities 

the company’s remaining other noncurrent liabilities primarily consist of items for which the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services which include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices “ssps” because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company’s estimated ssps revenue allocated to the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided 

the company’s process for determining estimated ssps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s ssps and the future rate of related amortization for productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the nature of the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  25 

valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company invests in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm agreements to secure the supply of inventory the company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are the key inputs in the determination of the recoverability of manufacturingrelated assets and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record writedowns or impairments of manufacturingrelated assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees 

warranty costs 

the company offers limited warranties on its new hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products and customers may purchase extended service coverage where available on many of the company’s hardware products the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required 

income taxes 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greaterthan50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

apple inc  2019 form 10k  26 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 28 2019 and september 29 2018  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 28 billion and 49 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of september 28 2019 and september 29 2018  the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1021 billion and 1025 billion  respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 28 2019 and september 29 2018 to increase by 325 million and 399 million on an annualized basis respectively 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 452 million as of september 28 2019  compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 592 million as of september 29 2018  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 28 2019 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

the company’s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv software ios macos watchos and tvos online services and distribution of digital content and applications digital content and services some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the us and ireland a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are singlesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days  

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through rd licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology 

intellectual property 

the company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  5 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company’s products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

during 2018 the company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 37  and 63  respectively of total net sales gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user the company also offers a 90day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

employees 

as of september 29 2018  the company had approximately 132000 fulltime equivalent employees

risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition operating results and stock price 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth  

the company has international operations with sales outside the us representing a majority of the company’s total net sales in addition a majority of the company’s supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the us as a result the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions 

adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors 

in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company’s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company’s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company’s products and insolvency 

a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company’s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company’s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company’s financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully 

the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  8 

the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company’s competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss 

additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions 

some of the markets in which the company competes including the market for personal computers have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted in addition an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the company’s existing products 

the company’s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications 

the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its retail and online stores 

some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  9 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days  because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms 

because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and growth ”  above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on singlesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  10 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted 

the company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company’s business and result in harm to the company’s reputation 

the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects may also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company’s products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company’s products and services in addition the company may be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory property plant and equipment andor intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the company’s products and services and result in harm to the company’s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue 

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make thirdparty digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  11 

the company’s minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices may suffer 

the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers 

the company sells and delivers thirdparty applications for its products through the app store mac app store and tv app store the company retains a commission from sales through these platforms if developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer inapp purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights  

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party 

claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  12 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities in areas including but not limited to labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products 

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company’s brand international growth efforts and business 

the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

the company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company’s business by among other things preventing access to the company’s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products these events could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information “pii” with respect to the company’s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

the company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company’s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company 

although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes 

the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and services 

in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company’s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company’s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  14 

under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability 

the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability 

the company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located 

the company’s business may be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions 

political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners 

international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the company’s business tariffs could increase the cost of the company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs could also make the company’s products more expensive for customers which could make the company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the company’s ability to offer its products and services political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company’s business 

many of the company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the company’s control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations and lose significant revenue because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  15 

the company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company’s business and harm to the company’s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the company sells shifts in the geographic currency or channel mix of the company’s sales component cost increases price competition or the introduction of new products including new products with higher cost structures 

the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products issues with new product introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company’s board of directors and the company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 

the company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–us dollar–denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the us dollar’s strengthening which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales 

conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance the company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 29 2018  a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of iphone ipad mac and certain other products the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software andor nonsoftware services free of charge because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the company’s esps is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided 

the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company’s assessment of whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security which would have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

inventory valuation valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory the company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends if the company determines inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value it records a writedown of the inventories the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value any writedowns andor impairments the company may be required to record would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days  if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating results 

warranty costs 

the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  34 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the company’s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the act which significantly changed us tax law the act lowered the company’s us statutory federal income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings the impact of the act increased the company’s provision for income taxes by 15 billion  during 2018 this increase was composed of 20 billion  related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and 12 billion  associated with the deemed repatriation tax partially offset by a 17 billion  impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the company’s unrecognized tax benefits certain amounts reported by the company related to the act are provisional estimates in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 resolution of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 9 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “contingencies” in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 49 billion and 60 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

apple inc  2018 form 10k  35 

as of september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1025 billion  and 1037 billion  respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 29 2018  and september 30 2017  to increase by 399 million and 376 million on an annualized basis respectively 

further details regarding the company’s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 5 “debt” 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 592 million as of september 29 2018  compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 485 million as of september 30 2017  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 29 2018  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices many of the company’s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features including security features relative price and performance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company’s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv software ios macos watchos and tvos online services and distribution of digital content and applications digital content and services some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources a few components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

apple inc  2017 form 10k  5 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the us and ireland a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days  

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through rd licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology total rd expense was  116 billion   100 billion  and  81 billion  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

intellectual property 

the company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

during 2017  the company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 37  and 63  respectively of total net sales information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the subheading “segment operating performance” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 11 “segment information and geographic data” 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the us and ireland the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance 

apple inc  2017 form 10k  6 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance

risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition operating results and stock price 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values andor other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the us dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services 

in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company’s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company’s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected

the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications some of the company’s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages 

the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its retail and online stores 

some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days  because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms 

because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company”  above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases 

the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted

the company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation the company’s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make thirdparty digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 

with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company’s ios devices rather than its competitors’ platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s ios devices may suffer 

apple inc  2017 form 10k  11 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party 

claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

in management’s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain 

although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products 

apple inc  2017 form 10k  12 

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company’s brand international growth efforts and business 

the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company’s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company’s business by among other things preventing access to the company’s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products these events could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results

there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information “pii” with respect to the company’s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

the company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company’s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company 

although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes 

the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and services 

in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company’s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company’s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines 

under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability 

the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening us dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing 

the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company’s board of directors and the company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention

the company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonus dollardenominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance the company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 30 2017  a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software andor nonsoftware services free of charge because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the company’s esps is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided 

the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company’s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company’s operating results 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company’s assessment of whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security which would have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

inventory valuation valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory andor impairments of manufacturingrelated assets or inventory prepayments these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturingrelated assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional writedowns were recorded 

the company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days  if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded 

apple inc  2017 form 10k  34 

warranty costs 

the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities could be required and could materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 30 2017  and september 24 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 60 billion and 49 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of september 30 2017  and september 24 2016  the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1037 billion  and 789 billion  respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 30 2017  and september 24 2016  to increase by 376 million and 271 million on an annualized basis respectively 

further details regarding the company’s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6 “debt” 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreigndenominated debt issuances the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

apple inc  2017 form 10k  36 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 485 million as of september 30 2017  compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 434 million as of september 24 2016  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 30 2017  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company’s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features including security features relative price and performance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company’s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv software ios macos watchos and tvos online services and distribution of digital content and applications internet services some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and the company often utilizes custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

while some mac computers are manufactured in the us and ireland substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through rd licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology total rd expense was  100 billion   81 billion  and  60 billion  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

during 2016  the company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 35 and 65 respectively of total net sales information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the subheading “segment operating performance” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 11 “segment information and geographic data” 

while some mac computers are manufactured in the us and ireland substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

employees 

as of september 24 2016  the company had approximately 116000 fulltime equivalent employees

risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition operating results and stock price 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values andor other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the us dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services 

in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company’s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company’s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the companys products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

apple inc  2016 form 10k  8 

the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications some of the company’s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages 

the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its online and retail stores 

some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

many resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

apple inc  2016 form 10k  9 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms 

because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company”  above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases 

the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted

the company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation the company’s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available thirdparty digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third‑party software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third‑party software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 

with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company’s ios devices rather than its competitors’ platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s ios devices may suffer

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future 

for example technology companies including many of the company’s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained the intellectual property rights claims against the company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the companys cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products 

in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation 

in management’s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain 

although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products 

apple inc  2016 form 10k  12 

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company’s brand international growth efforts and business 

the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company’s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company’s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting

there may be breaches of the company’s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information “pii” this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages 

the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders 

the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company’s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk 

the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability 

the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability 

the company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located

the company’s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company’s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain while the companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the companys business and harm to the companys reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company’s rd activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening us dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing 

the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company’s board of directors and the company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 

apple inc  2016 form 10k  15 

the company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonus dollardenominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance the company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 24 2016  a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the us and ireland 

the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the us internal revenue service the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the us or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected

iphone net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 the company believes the sales decline is due primarily to a lower rate of iphone upgrades during 2016 compared to 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions in a number of major markets in 2016 average selling prices “asps” for iphone were lower yearoveryear during 2016 due primarily to a different mix of iphones including the iphone se introduced in 2016 and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the us dollar

the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 24 2016  and september 26 2015  a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 49 billion and 43 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of september 24 2016  and september 26 2015  the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 789 billion and 558 billion respectively the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 24 2016  and september 26 2015  to increase by 271 million and 200 million on an annualized basis respectively 

further details regarding the company’s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6 “debt” 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and may enter in the future into nondesignated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreigndenominated debt issuances the company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

apple inc  2016 form 10k  36 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 434 million as of september 24 2016  compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 342 million as of september 26 2015  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 24 2016  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company’s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features including security features relative price and performance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company’s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

 

apple inc  2015 form 10k  5 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and the company often utilizes custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

while some mac computers are manufactured in the us and ireland substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through rd licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology total rd expense was 81 billion 60 billion and 45 billion in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties

while some mac computers are manufactured in the us and ireland substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

employees 

as of september 26 2015 the company had approximately 110000 fulltime equivalent employees

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10k the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition operating results and stock price 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values andor other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the us dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services 

in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company’s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company’s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

 

apple inc  2015 form 10k  8 

the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that include content provided to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications some of the company’s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages 

the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its online and retail stores 

carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

 

apple inc  2015 form 10k  9 

many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities 

because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company” above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases 

the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted 

the company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation the company’s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available thirdparty digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 

with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the company’s ios devices rather than its competitors’ platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s ios devices may suffer 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future 

for example technology companies including many of the company’s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company’s cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products 

in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

 

apple inc  2015 form 10k  12 

regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation 

in management’s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain 

although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company’s brand international growth efforts and business 

the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses

the company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company’s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company’s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the company’s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting 

there may be breaches of the company’s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information “pii” this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages 

the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders 

 

apple inc  2015 form 10k  14 

the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company’s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection

 the company’s effective tax rates for 2015 2014 and 2013 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland for which no us taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us the higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes the effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was relatively flat

on june 11 2014 the european commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against ireland for alleged state aid to the company the opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company the company believes the european commission’s assertions are without merit if the european commission were to conclude against ireland the european commission could require ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid while such amount could be material as of september 26 2015 the company is unable to estimate the impact

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors

inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory andor manufacturingrelated assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturingrelated assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

 

apple inc  2015 form 10k  34 

the company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products a change in the company’s product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 26 2015 and september 27 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 43 billion and 34 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

as of september 26 2015 and september 27 2014 the company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 560 billion and 290 billion respectively the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt as of september 26 2015 and september 27 2014 to increase by 200 million and 110 million on an annualized basis respectively 

further details regarding the company’s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6 “debt” 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and may enter in the future into nondesignated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreigndenominated debt issuances the company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

 

apple inc  2015 form 10k  36 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 342 million as of september 26 2015 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 240 million as of september 27 2014 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 26 2015 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company’s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company’s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iphone ipad mac and ipod software ios os x and itunes online services and distribution of digital content and applications itunes store app store ibooks store and mac app store some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

 

apple inc  2014 form 10k  6 

while the company manufactures some macs in the united states substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through rd licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology total rd expense was 60 billion 45 billion and 34 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

during 2014 the company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 38 and 62 respectively of total net sales information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the subheading “segment operating performance” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 11 “segment information and geographic data” 

while substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia the company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in ireland the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” 

 

apple inc  2014 form 10k  7 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

employees 

as of september 27 2014 the company had approximately 92600 fulltime equivalent employees and an additional 4400 fulltime equivalent temporary employees and contractors approximately 46200 of the total fulltime equivalent employees worked in the company’s retail segment

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and stock price 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values andor other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the us dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services 

in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company’s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company’s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them

the company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in rd the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications and with business models that include content provided to users for free some of the company’s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages 

the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its online and retail stores 

carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities 

because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components the followon effects from global economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company” above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases 

the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted 

the company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation the company’s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company’s reputation

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes store this includes the right to make available music movies tv shows and books currently available through the itunes store the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available thirdparty digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 

with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company’s ios devices rather than its competitors’ platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s ios devices may suffer 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future 

for example technology companies including many of the company’s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company’s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products 

in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation 

in management’s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain 

although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

 

apple inc  2014 form 10k  14 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company’s retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company’s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the company’s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting 

there may be breaches of the company’s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information “pii” this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages 

the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders 

the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company’s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening us dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing 

the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses the company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company’s board of directors and the company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 

the company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonus dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance the company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 27 2014 a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the us and ireland for example in june 2014 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the company’s irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if the european commission were to take a final decision against ireland it could require changes to existing tax rulings that in turn could increase the company’s taxes in the future the european commission could also require ireland to recover from the company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid 

the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the us or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

as of september 27 2014 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 51 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 203 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 

during the fiscal year ended september 27 2014 the us internal revenue service “irs” concluded its review of the years 2004 through 2009 the irs is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012 in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices mac and apple tv the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers the company also provides various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the company’s esps is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided for each of these devices which ranges from two to four years 

 

apple inc  2014 form 10k  39 

the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s esps and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services and the estimated period software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company’s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security 

inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 

 

apple inc  2014 form 10k  40 

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory inventory prepayments andor manufacturingrelated capital assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products if the company’s product development plans change or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries the company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company’s debt 

investments 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company’s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 27 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 34 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september 28 2013 a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a 27 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

debt 

in april 2014 the board of directors authorized the company to issue commercial paper pursuant to a commercial paper program as of september 27 2014 the company had 63 billion of commercial paper outstanding with maturities generally less than nine months 

in the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 the company issued 120 billion and 170 billion of longterm debt respectively the debt issuances included floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of 290 billion collectively the “notes” the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the notes interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments in the third quarter of 2014 the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 90 billion which effectively converted most of the fixedrate notes into floatingrate notes and in the third quarter of 2013 the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 30 billion which effectively converted the floatingrate notes into fixedrate notes as of september 27 2014 a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company’s debt to increase by 110 million on an annualized basis 

further details regarding the company’s debt is provided in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 6 “debt” 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries the company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 240 million as of september 27 2014 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 201 million as of september 28 2013 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 27 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

to ensure a highquality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide the company’s retail stores are typically located at hightraffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts by operating its own stores and locating them in desirable hightraffic locations the company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers the stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the company’s products and related solutions the retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice service and training and offer a wide selection of thirdparty hardware software and other accessories and peripherals that complement the company’s products

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2013 2012 or 2011 

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company’s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and peripherals ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company’s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iphone ipad mac and ipod software ios os x and itunes online services and distribution of digital content and applications itunes store app store ibooks store and mac app store some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

while the company has announced plans to begin manufacturing some macs in the united states substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days 

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology total research and development expense was 45 billion 34 billion and 24 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iphone ipad mac and ipod devices peripherals software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the us and worldwide the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

  

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

during 2013 the company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 39 and 61 respectively of total net sales information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the subheading “segment operating performance” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 11 “segment information and geographic data” 

while substantially all of the company’s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia the company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in ireland the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” 

business seasonality and product introductions 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

  

employees 

as of september 28 2013 the company had approximately 80300 fulltime equivalent employees and an additional 4100 fulltime equivalent temporary employees and contractors approximately 42800 of the total fulltime equivalent employees worked in the company’s retail segment

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values andor other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the us dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services 

in the event of further financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company’s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to 

  

finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restricting the company’s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in research and development the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications some of the company’s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages 

the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and peripherals the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed 

  

customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions 

the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its online and retail stores 

carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users’ purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the 

  

carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities 

because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all the followon effects from global economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company” above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases 

the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners in asia for final assembly of substantially all 

  

of the company’s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues 

the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted 

the company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation the company’s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes store this includes the right to make available music movies tv shows and books currently available through the itunes store the licensing arrangements with these third parties are shortterm and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available thirdparty digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

some thirdparty digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

  

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated continued growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 

with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store the absence of multiple distribution channels which are available for competing platforms may limit the availability and acceptance of thirdparty applications by the company’s customers thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform in addition ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company’s products rather than its competitors’ platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s ios devices may suffer 

the company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future 

for example technology companies including many of the company’s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company’s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in europe and asia the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products 

  

in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation 

in management’s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain 

although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities including but not limited to areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications delays in product shipment dates or preclude the company from selling certain products 

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies and procedures 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements 

  

environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company’s retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company’s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company’s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the company’s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting 

  

there may be breaches of the company’s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information “pii” this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages 

the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders 

the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company’s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability 

the company’s privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website any failure by the company its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others 

the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

  

the company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located 

the company’s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other circumstances 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company’s business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company’s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening us dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing 

the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses the company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price reflects 

  

expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company’s board of directors and the company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 

the company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonus dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 28 2013 a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables was 

  

concentrated within cellular network carriers and its nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company’s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the us and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the us or ireland or if the ultimate determination of the company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

 the gross margin percentage in 2013 was 376 compared to 439 in 2012 the yearoveryear decrease in gross margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins introduction of ipad mini with gross margin significantly below the company’s average product margins higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the company’s service policies and other 

  

warranty costs price reductions on certain products including ipad 2 and iphone 4 and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations 

the gross margin percentage in 2012 was 439 compared to 405 in 2011 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 459 compared to 414 during the second half of 2012 the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales additionally gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers price reductions on certain existing products higher transition costs associated with product launches and continued strengthening of the us dollar partially offset by lower commodity costs 

the company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2014 to be between 365 and 375 the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2014 is forwardlooking and could differ from actual results the company’s future gross margin can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth above in part i item 1a of this form 10k under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the us dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates

the company’s other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties as of september 28 2013 the company had noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 165 billion additionally as of september 28 2013 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 27 billion and an additional 590 million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

indemnification 

the company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by 

  

the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified thirdparty however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of endusers of its operating system or application software for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september 28 2013 or september 29 2012 

the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the 

  

company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices mac and apple tv the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers the company also provides various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the company’s esps is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided for each of these devices which ranges from two to four years 

the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company’s esps and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services and the estimated period software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company’s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities 

  

impact the company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security 

inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 

the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory inventory prepayments andor manufacturingrelated capital assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company’s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company’s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company’s suppliers that hold any of the company’s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such writedowns would adversely affect the company’s results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products if the company’s product development plans change or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates 

  

these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

investments 

while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries the company’s interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company a portion of the company’s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company’s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks the company’s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 28 2013 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 27 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september 29 2012 a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a 21 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

longterm debt 

in the third quarter of 2013 the company issued 170 billion of longterm debt which included 30 billion of floatingrate notes to manage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floatingrate notes the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 30 billion which in effect fixed the interest rate of the floatingrate notes 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local 

  

currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries the company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 201 million as of september 28 2013 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 200 million as of september 29 2012 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 28 2013 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

markets and distribution 

the company’s customers are primarily in the consumer smb education enterprise and government markets the company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels such as its retail stores online stores and direct sales force and thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products the company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a highquality sales and aftersales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers to ensure a highquality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide additionally the company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality apple fixtures merchandising materials and other resources within selected thirdparty reseller locations through the apple premium reseller program certain thirdparty resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services and product expertise 

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2012 2011 or 2010 

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company’s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and peripherals ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include several large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company’s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iphone ipad mac and ipod software itunes online services icloud and distribution of digital content and applications itunes store app store ibookstore and mac app store some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

  

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations in addition the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days 

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology total research and development expense was 34 billion 24 billion and 18 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iphone ipad mac and ipod devices peripherals software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company 

  

has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the us and worldwide the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

during 2012 the company’s domestic and international net sales accounted for 39 and 61 respectively of total net sales information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the subheading “segment operating performance” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 8 “segment information and geographic data” 

final assembly of the company’s products is currently performed in the company’s manufacturing facility in ireland and by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 7 “commitments and contingencies” 

seasonal business 

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to holiday seasonal demand actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions by the company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the company in any particular quarter however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in addition where available consumers may purchase app or app which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately 

  

following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

employees 

as of september 29 2012 the company had approximately 72800 fulltime equivalent employees and an additional 3300 fulltime equivalent temporary employees and contractors approximately 42400 of the total fulltime equivalent employees worked in the company’s retail segment

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values for example the continuing sovereign debt crisis financial market volatility and other factors in europe have resulted in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the us dollar other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services 

in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company’s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance 

  

development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets 

the company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in research and development and currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company’s products and infringing its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected 

the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications the company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages 

the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and peripherals the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has 

  

been particularly intense as competitors selling windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts open orders and where appropriate inventory component prepayments in each case based on projected demand such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities 

because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all the followon effects from 

  

global economic conditions on the company’s suppliers described in “ global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company” above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components  therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2012 largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases future strengthening of the us dollar could also negatively impact gross margin 

the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur 

the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues 

the company relies on thirdparty intellectual property and digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all 

the company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes store the licensing arrangements with these third parties are shortterm and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors 

  

may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach 

many thirdparty content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company is frequently involved in intellectual property litigation and could be found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 

technology companies including many of the company’s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company’s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in europe and asia the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation such litigation is often expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products 

in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

in management’s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

  

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated continued growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 

with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store the absence of multiple distribution channels which are available for competing platforms may limit the availability and acceptance of thirdparty applications by the company’s customers thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform in addition ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company’s products rather than its competitors’ platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s ios devices may suffer 

the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its online and retail stores 

carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users’ purchase of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company’s products or uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

the company’s retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the 

  

company’s more typical retail stores due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful 

the company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin 

the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation the company’s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company’s reputation 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities including but not limited to areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of the device locking the device to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications delays in product shipment dates or preclude the company from selling certain products 

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance this increases the costs of doing business and any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and 

  

regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies 

the company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located 

the company’s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other circumstances 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company’s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company’s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations 

the company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or similar events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the company’s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting 

the company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems which could damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services and could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information “pii” this may include names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact 

  

preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company may be at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii managed 

the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data these security measures may be compromised as a result of thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders 

the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security the company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data moreover if a computer security breach affects the company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of the company’s products and services could decrease the company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability 

the company’s privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website any failure by the company its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others 

the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its 

  

indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix new products component cost increases strengthening us dollar or price competition the company has typically experienced higher net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due in part to holiday seasonal demand actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions by the company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the company in any particular quarter the company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonus dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide for example the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain european countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related financial restructuring efforts by european governments may cause the value of several european currencies including the euro to fluctuate which could adversely affect the company’s nonus dollar sales and operating expenses in the impacted jurisdictions weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

  

the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

the company has not recognized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities but could experience significant declines in the market value of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september 29 2012 a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables were concentrated within cellular network carriers and its nontrade receivables and longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses 

the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and regardless of the merit of the claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation 

although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction including the us subject to significant change the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory 

  

tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products 

  

software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices mac and apple tv the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers the company also provides various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the company’s esps is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided for each of these devices which ranges from two to four years 

the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services or the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors the company’s esps and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company’s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net 

  

of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a 

  

valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 7 “commitments and contingencies” the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims including those that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected

the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to holiday seasonal demand actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions 

  

by the company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the company in any particular quarter however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future net sales or financial performance 

growth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012 rising 341 billion or 66 compared to the same period in 2011 the net sales growth during the first six months of 2012 reflects the launch of iphone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and the company’s ability to meet demand more quickly for iphone 4s when compared to the iphone 4 launch growth during the first half of 2012 was also favorably impacted by the addition of a 14 th week in the first quarter of 2012 and strong unit sales of ipad during the holiday season resulting in a 111 increase in ipad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011

americas 

net sales in the americas segment increased 192 billion or 50 during 2012 compared to 2011 the growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iphone following the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5 strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2 and higher sales from the itunes store the americas segment represented approximately 37 and 35 of the company’s total net sales for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

net sales in the americas segment increased 138 billion or 56 during 2011 compared to 2010 the primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant yearoveryear increase in iphone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4 and increased sales of ipad and mac partially offset by a decrease in ipod sales higher sales of thirdparty digital content and applications from the itunes store also drove an increase in net sales during 2011 the americas segment represented approximately 35 and 37 of the company’s total net sales for 2011 and 2010 respectively 

europe 

net sales in the europe segment increased 85 billion or 31 during 2012 compared to 2011 the growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2 higher sales from the itunes store and increased demand for iphone from the launch of iphone 4s iphone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and did not contribute to the growth in net sales in the europe segment to the extent it did in other segments lower yearoveryear growth in net sales in the europe segment during 2012 compared to the company’s other geographic segments reflects growth in iphone unit sales that was well below the growth rates experienced by the company’s other operating segments partially offset by strong growth in ipad unit sales net sales in the europe segment were also negatively impacted by the region’s uncertain economic conditions and the strength in the us dollar relative to several european currencies including the euro the europe segment represented approximately 23 and 26 of the company’s total net sales for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

net sales in the europe segment increased 91 billion or 49 during 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in net sales during 2011 was attributable primarily to the continued yearoveryear increase in iphone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4 and increased sales of ipad and mac partially offset by a decrease in ipod sales the europe segment represented 26 and 29 of the company’s total net sales for 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

japan 

net sales in the japan segment increased 51 billion or 94 during 2012 compared to 2011 the growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iphone following the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5 expanded distribution with a new iphone carrier strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2 higher sales from the itunes store and strength in the japanese yen relative to the us dollar the japan segment represented approximately 7 and 5 of the company’s total net sales for 2012 and 2011 respectively

asiapacific 

net sales in the asiapacific segment increased 107 billion or 47 during 2012 compared to 2011 the growth in net sales during 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iphone from the launch of iphone 4s strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2 and higher mac sales growth in the asia pacific segment was affected by the timing of iphone and ipad product launches iphone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the asia pacific segment during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was not launched in china during 2012 and the new ipad that was introduced by the company in march 2012 was not launched in china until the fourth quarter of 2012 the asiapacific segment represented approximately 21 of the company’s total net sales in both 2012 and 2011 

net sales in the asia pacific segment increased 143 billion or 174 during 2011 compared to 2010 the company experienced particularly strong yearoveryear net sales growth in its asia pacific segment during 2011 especially in greater china which includes hong kong and taiwan korea and australia also experienced strong yearoveryear revenue growth higher net sales in the asia pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iphone sales primarily attributable to the strong demand for iphone 4 and carrier expansion strong sales of ipad and increased mac sales the asia pacific segment represented 21 and 13 of the company’s total net sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

retail 

net sales in the retail segment increased 47 billion or 33 during 2012 compared to 2011 the growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iphone following the launches of iphone 4s and iphone 5 strong demand for the new ipad and ipad 2 and higher mac net sales lower yearoveryear growth in net sales in the retail segment during 2012 compared to the company’s other segments reflects the significant growth in ipad indirect distribution channel expansion the retail segment accounted for 12 and 13 of the company’s total net sales for 2012 and 2011 respectively

net sales in the retail segment increased 43 billion or 44 during 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for ipad higher mac sales and an increase in iphone sales the company opened 40 new retail stores during 2011 28 of which were outside the us ending the year with 357 stores open compared to 317 stores at the end of 2010 as of september 24 2011 the company had a total of 245 us retail stores and 112 international retail stores during 2011 the company had an average of 326 stores compared to an average of 288 stores during 2010 the average revenue per store increased 27 to 

  

433 million in 2011 compared to 341 million in 2010 the retail segment represented 13 and 15 of the company’s total net sales in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the retail segment’s operating income was 47 billion 32 billion and 23 billion during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these yearoveryear increases in retail operating income were primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during the respective years 

gross margin 

gross margin for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 the gross margin percentage in 2012 was 439 compared to 405 in 2011 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales the increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar the gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 459 compared to 414 during the second half of 2012 the primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iphone sales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales additionally gross margin in the second half of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers price reductions on certain existing products higher transition costs associated with product launches and continued strengthening of the us dollar partially offset by lower commodity costs 

the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 405 compared to 394 in 2010 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs 

the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2012 and the company anticipates gross margin of about 36 during the first quarter of 2013 expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases future strengthening of the us dollar could further negatively impact gross margin 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in future periods including the first quarter of 2013 are forwardlooking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including but not limited to those set forth above in part i item 1a of this form 10k under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

  

operating expenses 

operating expenses for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

 research and development “rd” expense 

rd expense increased 952 million or 39 in 2012 compared to 2011 and 647 million or 36 in 2011 compared to 2010 the growth in rd expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded rd activities although total rd expense increased 39 and 36 in 2012 and 2011 respectively it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales 

the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to make further investments in rd to remain competitive 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense 

sga expense increased 24 billion or 32 during 2012 compared to 2011 and 21 billion or 38 during 2011 compared to 2010 these increases were primarily due to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment increased headcount and related expenses higher spending on professional services marketing and advertising programs and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company’s net sales 

other income and expense 

other income and expense for 2012 2011 and 2010 are as follows in millions 

 

 total other income and expense increased 107 million or 26 to 522 million during 2012 compared to 415 million and 155 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the yearoveryear increase in other income and expense during 2012 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income on the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts the overall increase in other income and expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to higher interest income and net realized gains on sales of marketable securities the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 103 077 and 075 during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively during 2012 2011 and 2010 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were approximately 252 242 and 244 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the company’s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 

  

35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

as of september 29 2012 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 40 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 149 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009 all irs audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 

liquidity and capital resources

in march 2012 the company’s board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 10 billion of the company’s common stock beginning in 2013 the repurchase program is expected to be executed over a threeyear period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs the repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares the company anticipates that it will utilize approximately 45 billion of domestic cash to pay dividends repurchase shares and to remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units in the first three years of the dividend and stock repurchase programs the company anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the repurchase program will come primarily from current domestic cash and from ongoing us operating activities and the cash generated from such activities 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company 

the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 29 2012 and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in millions

indemnification 

the company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified thirdparty however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of endusers of its operating system or application software for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september 29 2012 or september 24 2011 

the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries the company’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company a portion of the company’s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company’s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks the company’s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 29 2012 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 21 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september 24 2011 a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would result in a 913 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries generally the company’s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to six months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

  

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 200 million as of september 29 2012 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 161 million as of september 24 2011 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 29 2012 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company’s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and peripherals ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to mobile communication and media devices these industries are highly competitive and include several large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these industries to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company’s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these industries are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iphone ipad mac and ipod software itunes and distribution of digital content and applications itunes store app store ibookstore and mac app store some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets it competes in 

  

supply of components 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks many components are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations in addition the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device and personal computer industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

substantially all of the company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners primarily located in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturer for many of the company’s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s purchase commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods up to 150 days 

research and development 

because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology total research and development expense was 24 billion 18 billion and 13 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iphone ipad mac and ipod devices peripherals software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

  

the company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the us and worldwide the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products due to the fast pace of innovation and product development the company’s products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods based upon past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

the us represents the company’s largest geographic market approximately 39 of the company’s net sales in 2011 came from sales to customers inside the us final assembly of the company’s products is currently performed in the company’s manufacturing facility in ireland and by outsourcing partners primarily located in asia the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe singlesourced outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item 7 and item 8 of this form 10k and in notes to consolidated financial statements in note 8 “segment information and geographic data” 

seasonal business 

the company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to increased holiday seasonal demand this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in addition consumers may purchase the app which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products in most of its major markets 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers 

  

believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

employees 

as of september 24 2011 the company had approximately 60400 fulltime equivalent employees and an additional 2900 fulltime equivalent temporary employees and contractors

 item 1a risk factors tableend because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material negative effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to offset the effect of a strengthening of the us dollar other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services and the company’s financial condition and operating results 

in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company’s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances and 

  

changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

global markets for the company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks by contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related thirdparty digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company’s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications the company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages 

the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using mac os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and peripherals the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages 

  

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes such charges could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts open orders and where appropriate inventory component prepayments in each case based on projected demand such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments the company’s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the company’s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to shortterm shifts in customer demand patterns 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities 

because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all the followon effects from the credit crisis on the company’s suppliers referred to in “ economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company ” above also could affect the company’s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect the company’s 

  

financial condition and operating results the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2011 largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and potential future component cost and other cost increases 

the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device and personal computer industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements if the supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom are located outside of the us 

substantially all of the company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners primarily located in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects the company also relies on its partners to adhere to the company’s supplier code of conduct any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability whether pursuant to arrangements with outsourcing partners or otherwise or material violations of the supplier code of conduct could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the us asia and europe singlesourced outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company’s hardware products if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company relies on thirdparty intellectual property and digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of the company’s products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms or at all if the company is unable to obtain or renew critical licenses on reasonable terms its financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

the company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes store the licensing arrangements with these third parties are shortterm and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the 

  

company to license their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the cost of such content if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach the company’s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

many thirdparty content providers require the company to provide digital rights management “drm” and other security solutions if these requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company’s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is found to have infringed on intellectual property rights 

technology companies including many of the company’s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company’s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of us jurisdictions and before the us international trade commission as well as internationally in europe and asia the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages 

regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents it may be required to pay substantial damages if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a thirdparty its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology 

in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company’s operating expenses 

in management’s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

the company’s future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company’s products if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated continued acceptance by customers of mac os x and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 

with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store the absence of multiple distribution channels which are available for competing platforms may limit the availability and acceptance of thirdparty applications by the company’s customers thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform in addition ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company’s products rather than its competitors’ products including devices that use competing platforms if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices may suffer 

the company’s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through wholesalers resellers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells many of its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education customers cellular network carriers’ distribution channels resellers and consumers through its online and retail stores 

carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users’ purchase of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens if resellers stopped distributing the company’s products or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products 

  

the company’s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

the company’s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation inability to sell thirdparty products at adequate margins failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful they may materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin 

the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation the company’s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue harm to reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition or operating results 

the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these us and foreign laws and regulations affect the company’s activities including but not limited to areas of labor advertising content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax 

  

import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety 

by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of the device locking the device to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier’s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications delays in product shipment dates or preclude the company from selling certain products 

compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance this increases the costs of doing business and any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company’s products and services less attractive to the company’s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions cause the company to change or limit its business practices or affect the company’s financial condition and operating results the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition or operating results 

the company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its ceo its executive team and highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located 

political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company’s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company’s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in the event of a natural disaster losses significant recovery time and substantial expenditures could be required to resume operations and the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

please also refer to the discussion of risks related to the march 11 2011 japan earthquake and tsunami and the recent flooding in thailand in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the subheading “japan earthquake and tsunami and thailand flooding” which is incorporated herein by reference 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions that could damage the company’s reputation business operations and financial conditions 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or similar events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the company’s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting 

the company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems which could damage the company’s reputation business partner and customer relationships and access to online stores and services such breaches could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

the company’s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information “pii” this may include names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company may be at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii managed 

the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data these security measures may be compromised as a result of thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company’s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders 

the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security the company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data moreover if a computer security breach affects the company’s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of the company’s products and services could decrease the company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s business is subject to a variety of us and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection 

the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this 

  

area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability 

the company’s privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website any failure by the company its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policies or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate 

the company’s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix new products component cost increases strengthening us dollar or price competition the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due to increased holiday seasonal demand furthermore the company sells more products from timetotime during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s stock price is subject to volatility 

the company’s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility additionally the stock market as a whole has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and 

  

regulations a violation by the company’s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur the consequences of such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition or operating results 

the company’s financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance it can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to nonus dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances due to competition or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company has used derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities any significant declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company’s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited cellular network carriers accounted for a significant portion of the company’s trade receivables as of september 24 2011 the 

  

company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the company’s nontrade receivables as of september 24 2011 in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary conduct of business and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and regardless of the merit of the claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the company’s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation 

although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

changes in the company’s tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results 

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on the company’s profitability the company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results

japan earthquake and tsunami and thailand flooding 

on march 11 2011 the northeast coast of japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami with continuing aftershocks these geological events have caused significant damage in the region including severe damage to nuclear power plants and have impacted japan’s power and other infrastructure as well as its economy certain of the company’s suppliers are located in japan and certain of its other suppliers integrate components or use materials manufactured in japan in the production of its products to the extent that component production has been affected the company has generally obtained alternative sources of supply or implemented other measures the company does not currently believe these events will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of 2012 unless conditions worsen including but not limited to power outages and expansion of evacuation zones around the nuclear power plants 

beyond the first quarter of 2012 uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power the damage to nuclear power plants and the impact to other infrastructure thus there is a risk that the company could in the future experience delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and products andor price increases related to such components and products that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

  

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and undelivered nonsoftware services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 

for sales of iphone ipad apple tv for sales of ipod touch beginning in june 2010 and for sales of mac beginning in june 2011 the company has indicated it may from timetotime provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers in june 2011 the company announced it would begin providing various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company’s esps amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices which range from 24 to 48 months the company’s process for determining esps involves management’s judgment the company’s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services or the estimated lives of the related devices or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors the company’s esp for software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change if the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also change 

  

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods up to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to 

  

record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in note 7 “commitments and contingencies” in notes to consolidated financial statements the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations the company’s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

americas 

during 2011 net sales in the americas segment increased 138 billion or 56 compared to 2010 the primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant yearoveryear increase in iphone revenue from carrier expansion and strong demand for iphone 4 and increased sales of ipad and macs partially offset by a decrease in ipod net sales higher sales of thirdparty digital content and applications from the itunes store and app store also drove an increase in sales during 2011 the americas segment represented approximately 35 and 37 of the company’s total net sales for 2011 and 2010 respectively

the retail segment reported operating income of 33 billion during 2011 compared to 24 billion during 2010 the yearoveryear increase in retail operating income was primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during 2011 compared to 2010 the retail segment reported operating income of 17 billion during 2009 the increase in retail operating income during 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to higher overall net sales

gross margin 

gross margin for the three years ended september 24 2011 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 the gross margin percentage in 2011 was 405 compared to 394 in 2010 this yearoveryear increase in gross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs 

the gross margin percentage in 2010 was 394 compared to 401 in 2009 this yearoveryear decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to new products that had higher cost structures including ipad partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iphone which had a higher gross margin than the company average 

the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2011 largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and potential future component cost and other cost increases 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage are forwardlooking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i item 1a “risk factors” under the subheading “ future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities ” which is incorporated herein by reference in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to these competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the three years ended september 24 2011 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

 research and development expense “rd” 

rd expense increased 647 million or 36 to 24 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded rd activities although total 

  

rd expense increased 36 during 2011 compared to 2010 it declined slightly as a percentage of net sales due to the 66 yearoveryear growth in the company’s net sales during 2011 

rd expense increased 34 or 449 million to 18 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded rd activities also contributing to this increase in rd expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of 71 million related to mac os x snow leopard although total rd expense increased 34 during 2010 it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52 yearoveryear increase in net sales in 2010 

the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to make further investments in rd to remain competitive 

selling general and administrative expense “sga” 

sga expense increased 21 billion or 38 to 76 billion during 2011 compared to 2010 this increase was due primarily to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment increased headcount and related costs higher spending on professional services and marketing and advertising programs and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company’s net sales 

sga expense increased 14 billion or 33 to 55 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was due primarily to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment higher spending on marketing and advertising programs increased sharebased compensation expenses and variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company’s net sales

other income and expense for the three years ended september 24 2011 are as follows in millions 

 

 total other income and expense increased 260 million or 168 to 415 million during 2011 compared to 155 million and 326 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the yearoveryear increase in other income and expense during 2011 was due primarily to higher interest income and net realized gains on sales of marketable securities the overall decrease in other income and expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a yearoveryear basis partially offset by the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances additionally the company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts which further reduced the total other income and expense the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 077 075 and 143 during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively during 2011 2010 and 2009 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense

the company’s effective tax rates were approximately 242 244 and 318 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the company’s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 

  

35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

as of september 24 2011 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 32 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 92 billion management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office the irs is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009 all irs audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 

liquidity and capital resources

the company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the company’s investment policy requires investments to generally be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss as of september 24 2011 and september 25 2010 543 billion and 308 billion respectively of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in us dollardenominated holdings amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company 

the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 24 2011 and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in millions 

 

 lease commitments 

the company’s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years the majority of which are for 10 years and often contain multiyear renewal options as of september 24 2011 the company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were 30 billion of which 24 billion related to leases for retail space 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers 

the company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the company’s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company which typically covers periods up to 150 days the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information as of september 24 2011 the company had outstanding offbalance sheet thirdparty manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of 139 billion

indemnification 

the company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified thirdparty however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of endusers of its operating system or application software for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september 24 2011 or september 25 2010 

the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

interest rate risk 

while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries the company’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company a portion of the company’s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company’s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks the company’s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 

the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the company’s investment policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 24 2011 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 913 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september 25 2010 a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a 477 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries generally the company’s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to six months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 161 million as of september 24 2011 compared to a 

  

maximum oneday loss in fair value of 103 million as of september 25 2010 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 24 2011 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

  

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of marketable securities allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products eg mac computers iphones ipods and peripherals software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 

for multielement arrangements that include tangible products containing software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product’s essential software the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” 

for iphone the company indicated it might from timetotime provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers the company has identified two deliverables generally contained in arrangements involving the sale of iphone the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of iphone to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product’s essential software the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the two deliverables the allocation of revenue has been based on the company’s esps amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the 24month estimated life of the related hardware all product cost of sales including estimated warranty costs are generally recognized at the time of sale costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred if the estimated life of the hardware product should change the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change 

for all periods presented the company’s esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone sold is 25 the company’s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe involves management’s judgment the company’s process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable the company believes its customers particularly 

  

consumers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone this view is primarily based on the fact that upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered in the future therefore the company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis such as those included with iphone the selling price would be relatively low key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for iphone upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings the company’s historical pricing practices the nature of the upgrade rights eg unspecified and whenandifavailable and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors the company’s esp for software upgrades related to future iphone sales could change in future periods if the company’s esp for the unspecified software upgrade rights related to iphone had been 5 or 20 higher or lower the company’s net sales for the year ended september 26 2009 would have decreased or increased by 50 million as compared to the company’s net sales of 429 billion 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax as reported in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of investments impact the company’s net income only when such investments are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired or not could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty distributors cellular network carriers and resellers and directly to certain education consumer and enterprise customers the company generally does not require collateral from its customers however the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk in addition when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america europe asia and australia or by requiring thirdparty financing loans or leases to support credit exposure these creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer as such the company generally does not assume any recourse or creditrisksharing related to any of these arrangements however considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the creditworthiness and financial condition of those specific customers the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the general economic environment the financial condition of the company’s distribution channels and the aging of such receivables if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts which would affect its results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the personal computer mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual 

  

product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software’s compliance with specifications the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered the number of updates expected to occur and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with gaap the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap whereby the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results

americas 

during 2009 net sales in the americas segment increased 24 billion or 15 compared to 2008 the increase in net sales during 2009 was attributable to the significant yearoveryear increase in iphone revenue higher sales of thirdparty digital content and applications from the itunes store and increased sales of mac portable systems which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of mac desktop systems and ipods americas mac net sales decreased 6 due primarily to lower average selling prices while mac unit sales increased by 4 on a yearoveryear basis the increase in mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for the macbook pro which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008 the americas segment represented approximately 44 of the company’s total net sales in both 2009 and 2008 

during 2008 net sales in the americas segment increased 45 billion or 38 compared to 2007 the primary drivers of this growth were the significant yearoveryear increase in sales of iphone ipod touch mac portable systems and content from the itunes store the company began shipping iphone in june 2007 and the growth in iphone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iphone shipments as well as stronger demand for iphones in the fourth quarter of 2008 the increase in mac net sales of 14 billion or 31 and mac unit sales of 961 million or 32 is attributable to growth in sales of all of the mac portable systems particularly the macbook and higher sales of the imac net sales of ipods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced ipods particularly the ipod touch which was upgraded in june 2008 in 2008 the americas segment represented 44 of the company’s total net sales as compared to 48 in 2007 

europe 

during 2009 net sales in europe increased 26 billion or 28 compared to 2008 the increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iphone revenue and strong sales of mac portable systems offset partially by lower net sales of mac desktop systems ipods and a stronger us dollar mac unit sales increased 13 in 2009 compared to 2008 which was driven primarily by increased sales of mac portable systems particularly macbook pro while total mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all mac products although ipod net sales decreased in europe yearoveryear as a result of lower average selling prices ipod unit sales increased due to ipod touch and market share increases the europe segment represented 28 and 25 of total net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

europe’s net sales increased 38 billion or 69 during 2008 compared to 2007 the main drivers of this growth were strong sales of iphone mac portable systems and imac and increased sales from the itunes store also contributing to the increase in net sales were higher ipod net sales due primarily to the ipod touch which was upgraded in june 2008 sales of mac portable products increased due to stronger demand for the macbook pro and the macbook both updated in february 2008 as well as sales of the macbook air introduced in january 2008 mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the imac which was updated in april 2008 the europe segment represented 25 and 22 of total net sales in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

japan 

japan’s net sales increased 551 million or 32 in 2009 compared to 2008 the key contributors to this growth were increased iphone revenue stronger demand for certain mac portable systems and ipods and strength in the japanese yen partially offset by decreased sales of mac desktop systems net sales and unit sales of mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven primarily by stronger demand for macbook pro which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008 net sales and unit sales of ipods increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano 

  

japan net sales increased 644 million or 59 in 2008 compared to 2007 the primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iphones ipods imac mac portable systems and strong sales from the itunes store net sales unit sales and the average selling price of ipods increased during 2008 compared to 2007 driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano additionally mac net sales and unit sales grew 42 and 29 respectively in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of imac and mac portable systems particularly macbook as well as the introduction of macbook air in january 2008 

retail 

retail net sales decreased 636 million or 9 during 2009 compared to 2008 the decline in net sales was driven largely by a decrease in net sales of iphones ipods and mac desktop systems offset partially by strong demand for mac portable systems the company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009 including a total of 14 international stores ending the year with 273 stores open this compares to 247 stores open as of september 27 2008 and 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 

the yearoveryear decline in retail net sales is attributable to continued thirdparty channel expansion particularly in the us where most of the company’s stores are located and also reflects the challenging consumerspending environment with an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008 respectively average revenue per store decreased to 262 million for 2009 from 346 million in 2008 

the retail segment’s net sales grew by 29 billion or 67 during 2008 compared to 2007 due in large part to strong demand for the iphone increased sales of mac portable and desktop systems increased sales of ipod touch and new store openings the company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008 bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of september 27 2008 this compares to 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 with an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007 respectively average revenue per store increased to 346 million for 2008 from 245 million in 2007 

as measured by the company’s operating segment reporting the retail segment reported operating income of 17 billion during 2009 and 2008 and 876 million during 2007 despite the yearoveryear decline in retail net sales the retail segment’s operating income was flat at 17 billion in 2009 and 2008 due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced by the overall company the retail segment’s operating income increased by 785 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant retail net sales growth of 67 as compared to 2007 

expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure operating lease commitments personnel and other operating expenses capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment were 369 million in 2009 bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the retail segment to 18 billion as of september 26 2009 the retail segment had approximately 16500 fulltime equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of 15 billion the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

other segments 

the company’s other segments which consist of its asia pacific and filemaker operations experienced an increase in net sales of 482 million or 17 during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iphone and mac portable systems offset partially by a decline in sales related to ipods and mac desktop systems in the asia pacific region as well as a strengthening of the us dollar against the australian dollar and other asian currencies mac net sales and unit sales grew in the asia pacific region by 4 and 17 respectively due to increased sales of the macbook pro 

  

the company’s other segments experienced an increase in net sales of 10 billion or 59 during 2008 as compared to 2007 these increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of iphone mac portable systems ipods and imac in the company’s asia pacific region sales from the itunes store in the company’s asia pacific region grew 109 compared to 2007

the gross margin percentage in 2008 was 352 compared to 332 in 2007 the primary contributors of the increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity costs which were partially offset by higher other product costs in 2007 gross margin was impacted by higher than expected costs associated with the initial iphone product launch 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

 research and development “rd” 

rd expenditures increased 20 or 224 million to 13 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in the current year to support expanded rd activities and higher stockbased compensation expenses in addition 71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from rd expense during 2009 compared to 11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008 although total rd expense increased 20 during 2009 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14 increase in revenue in 2009 the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to make further investments in rd to remain competitive 

expenditures for rd increased 42 or 327 million to 11 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2008 and higher stockbased compensation expenses in 2008 11 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded 

  

from rd expense while rd expense for 2007 excluded 75 million of capitalized software development costs related to mac os x leopard and iphone software although total rd expense increased 42 during 2008 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 53 increase in revenue during 2008 

selling general and administrative expense “sga” 

sga expenditures increased 388 million or 10 to 41 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases are due primarily to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets higher stockbased compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising 

expenditures for sga increased 798 million or 27 to 38 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases are due primarily to higher stockbased compensation expenses higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant yearoveryear increase in total net sales and the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets in addition the company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007 

other income and expense 

other income and expense for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions 

 

 total other income and expense decreased 294 million or 47 to 326 million during 2009 compared to 620 million and 599 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 partially offset by the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 143 344 and 527 during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense 

the company’s investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of 16 million and 121 million as of september 26 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively which were offset by gross unrealized gains of 73 million and 4 million as of september 26 2009 and september 27 2008 respectively the net unrealized gains as of september 26 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of september 27 2008 related primarily to longterm marketable securities the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature the unrealized losses on the company’s marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates specifically widening credit spreads the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not the company will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis accordingly no material declines in fair value were recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of operations during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management the company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009 2008 and 2007 related to such sales 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were 32 32 and 30 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the company’s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

  

as of september 26 2009 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 19 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of 28 billion for presentation on the company’s consolidated balance sheet management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs

the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the company’s financial condition or operating results

competition 

the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business the markets for personal computers mobile communication devices consumer electronics related software services and peripheral products are highly competitive these markets are characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers mobile communication devices and other digital electronic devices that have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price feature and performance characteristics over the past several years price competition in these markets has been particularly intense the company’s competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins the principal competitive factors include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation availability of software and peripherals marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation further as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller simpler and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete with the company’s products 

the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to mobile communication devices including the iphone the mobile communications industry is highly competitive and includes several large wellfunded and experienced participants the company expects competition in the mobile communication industry to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the iphone’s functionality and applications within their own smart phones or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer this industry is characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses 

the company’s music products and services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services the company believes it currently retains a competitive advantage by offering superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware personal computer iphone and ipod software itunes and distribution of digital content and applications itunes store itunes wifi music store and app store some of the company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings alternatively these competitors may collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer 

  

the company’s future financial condition and operating results are substantially dependent on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets it competes in 

raw materials 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors enclosures certain liquid crystal displays “lcds” certain optical drives and applicationspecific integrated circuits “asics” are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations in addition the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable pricing but there is no guarantee the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms or at all upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results 

the company and other participants in the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

significant portions of the company’s mac computers iphones ipods logic boards and other assembled products are manufactured by outsourcing partners primarily in various parts of asia a significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the company’s outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the company’s key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the company’s portable mac computers iphones ipods and most of the company’s desktop products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s purchase commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days 

the company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the company if they were to encounter financial distress or become insolvent incur capacity or supply constraints become unable to obtain credit or for any other reason could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition at this time such vendors include without limitation 3m co advanced micro devices inc akm semiconductor inc amkor technology inc analog devices inc aptina imaging corp arm holdings plc atheros communications inc atmel corp au optronics corp avago technologies ltd

research and development 

because the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of computer hardware and peripherals mobile communication devices consumer electronics products system software applications software networking and communications software and solutions and internet services and solutions the company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and acquisition of thirdparty business and technology the company’s research and development expenditures totaled 13 billion 11 billion and 782 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems iphone and ipod devices peripherals software and services in addition the company has registered andor has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for “apple” the apple logo “macintosh” “mac” “iphone” “ipod” “itunes” “itunes store” “apple tv” “mobileme” and numerous other trademarks and service marks although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

the company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a portfolio of several thousand issued patents in the us and worldwide in addition the company currently holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of the applicable patents it has been granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products due to the fast pace of innovation and product development the company’s products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods the company believes based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no guarantee such licenses could be obtained at all because of technological changes in the computer digital music player and mobile communications industries current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

  

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data 

the us represents the company’s largest geographic marketplace approximately 54 of the company’s net sales in 2009 came from sales to customers inside the us final assembly of the company’s products is currently performed in the company’s manufacturing facility in ireland and by external vendors in california texas the people’s republic of china “china” the czech republic and the republic of korea “korea” currently the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by solesourced thirdparty vendors in the us china germany ireland israel japan korea malaysia the netherlands the philippines taiwan thailand and singapore solesourced thirdparty vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the company’s portable mac products iphone ipods and most of the company’s desktop products margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties 

information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item 7 and item 8 of this form 10k and in notes to consolidated financial statements at note 9 “segment information and geographic data” 

seasonal business 

the company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s future net sales or financial performance 

warranty 

the company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products including mac computers iphones and ipods the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in addition consumers may purchase the applecare protection plan which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products in most of its major markets 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

environmental laws 

compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in the future compliance with environmental laws could materially adversely affect the company 

production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various countries within europe and asia and certain states and provinces within north america although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition or operating results 

  

employees

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may continue to postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material negative effect on demand for the company’s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company’s expectations since the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to offset the effect of the strengthening of the us dollar a trend that has been very pronounced recently other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company’s products and services and on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

in the event of renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets in addition the risk remains that there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on the company’s business including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the company’s treasury operations other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

  

uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of the company’s stock price 

global markets for personal computers mobile communication devices digital music and video devices and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its personal computers mobile communication devices and consumer electronics including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks by contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

in the market for personal computers and peripherals the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed customer bases consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins the company also faces increased competition in key market segments including consumer smb education enterprise government and creative markets an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products 

the company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the mac os the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market which is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain functional and design advantages use of unauthorized copies of the mac os on other companies’ hardware products may result in decreased demand for the company’s hardware products and could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is currently focused on certain mobile communication devices such as iphone consumer electronic devices including the ipod family of digital music and video players and thirdparty digital content and applications distribution the company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications the company has only recently entered the mobile communications market and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have significantly greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to 

  

imitate the company’s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions 

the company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and nonexclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iphone there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value although the company believes its inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries the company will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges have and could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts open orders and where appropriate prepayments in each case based on projected demand such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products the company’s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the company’s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to shortterm shifts in customer demand patterns 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities 

because the company currently obtains certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors enclosures certain lcds certain optical drives and asics from single or limited sources the company is 

  

subject to significant supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dram and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable pricing but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms or at all upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future the followon effects from the credit crisis on the company’s key suppliers referred to in “ economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company” above which is incorporated herein by reference also could affect the company’s ability to obtain key components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages andor price increases that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2009 and 2008 due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures both expected and potential future cost increases for key components a stronger us dollar and higher logistical costs for additional information refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the subheading “gross margin” which is incorporated herein by reference 

the company and other participants in the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements if the supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties many of whom are located outside of the us 

most of the company’s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few thirdparty manufacturers many of these manufacturers are located outside of the us and are concentrated in several general locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions in addition the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers to adhere to the company’s supplier code of conduct although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

final assembly of the company’s products is currently performed in the company’s manufacturing facility in ireland and by external vendors in california texas china the czech republic and korea currently the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by solesourced thirdparty vendors in the us china germany ireland israel japan korea malaysia the netherlands the philippines taiwan thailand and singapore solesourced thirdparty vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the 

  

company’s portable mac products iphones ipods and most of the company’s desktop products if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company relies on thirdparty digital content and applications which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content and applications through the company’s itunes store the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio and video content the company’s licensing arrangements with these third parties are shortterm and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the total cost of such content if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach the company’s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

many thirdparty content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management “drm” and other security solutions if these requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company relies on access to thirdparty patents and intellectual property and the company’s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights 

many of the company’s products are designed to include thirdparty intellectual property and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods although the company believes that based on past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all 

because of technological changes in the global personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries current extensive patent coverage and the rapid issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights regardless of merit responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense at present the company is vigorously defending more than 47 patent infringement cases 27 of which were filed during fiscal 2009 and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur if the company is found to be infringing such rights it may be required to pay substantial damages if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology while in management’s opinion the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty should 

  

the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

with the june 2007 introduction of iphone the company has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors the company may have to engage in protracted litigation enter into expensive agreements or settlements andor modify its products any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s future performance depends on support from thirdparty software developers if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products including its macs iphones and ipods are often based to a certain extent on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the company’s products on a timely basis or at all and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated continued acceptance by customers of mac os x and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market the company’s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of thirdparty developers such as microsoft adobe and google to develop maintain and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the company’s products mac os x version 105 leopard “mac os x leopard” which became available in october 2007 includes a new feature that enables intelbased mac systems to run microsoft windows xp and windows vista operating systems this feature may deter developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such applications are already available for the windows platform 

with respect to iphone and ipod touch the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications unlike thirdparty software applications for mac products the software applications for the iphone and ipod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store the absence of multiple distribution channels which are available for competing platforms may limit the availability and acceptance of thirdparty applications by the company’s customers thereby causing developers to curtail significantly or stop development for the company’s platforms in addition iphone and ipod touch are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers further if the company develops its own software applications and services such development may negatively affect the decisions of thirdparty developers to develop maintain and upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iphone and ipod touch platforms as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company’s products rather than its competitors’ products including devices that use competing platforms if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices may suffer 

  

the company’s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through wholesalers resellers national and regional retailers valueadded resellers and cataloguers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells many of its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to endusers certain education customers and certain resellers through its online and retail stores iphone is distributed through the company its cellular network carriers’ distribution channels and certain thirdparty resellers 

many resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens if resellers stopped distributing the company’s products or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue 

the company’s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

through september 26 2009 the company had opened 273 retail stores the company’s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from five to 20 years the majority of which are for ten years certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results these risks and uncertainties include among other things macroeconomic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation inability to sell thirdparty products at adequate margins failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence because 

  

these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin 

the company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue harm to reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

in certain countries including the us the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone 

in the us germany spain ireland and certain other countries the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis if these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers in their markets on any basis including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services performance and timely buildout of advanced wireless networks and pricing and other terms of conditions of enduser contracts or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans sales may be materially adversely affected 

the company is subject to risks associated with laws regulations and industryimposed standards related to mobile communications devices 

laws and regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production manufacture distribution and use of the device locking the device to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier’s network could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

mobile communication devices such as iphone are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its ceo its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley where most of the company’s key personnel are located there can be no assurance that the company will continue to attract and retain key personnel 

in addition the company has relied on equity awards in the form of stock options and restricted stock units as one means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent significant adverse volatility in the company’s stock price could result in a stock option’s exercise price exceeding the underlying stock’s market value or a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units granted thus lessening the effectiveness of stockbased awards for retaining employees 

  

political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company’s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company’s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are located near major seismic faults because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 

the company may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors including without limitation earthquakes fire theft or other causes could disrupt the company’s operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer including channel partner orders negatively affecting the company’s online itunes mobileme and retail offerings and services impeding the manufacture or shipment of products processing transactions and reporting financial results resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information or damage to the company’s reputation while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 

the company’s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix new products component cost increases strengthening us dollar or price competition the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year respectively furthermore the company sells more products from timetotime during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s key logistics components supply or manufacturing partners could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

the company’s stock price continues to be volatile 

the company’s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors including but not limited to variations between its actual and anticipated financial results announcements by the company and its competitors and uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a large and growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations including without limitation import and export requirements the foreign corrupt practices act tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions and such costs may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation furthermore the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company’s policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition or operating results 

the company’s financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions political instability and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to nonus dollar denominated sales in europe japan australia canada and certain parts of asia as well as nonus dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances due to competition or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins 

the company has used derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

although the company has not recognized any material losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results given the global nature of its business the company has investments 

  

both domestically and internationally additionally the company’s overall investment portfolio has concentrations in the financial sector which has been negatively impacted by adverse market liquidity conditions in the recent past credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company also has unsecured nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the matters relating to the company’s past stock option practices and its restatement of consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation 

the company’s investigation into its past stock option practices and its restatement of prior financial statements in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended september 30 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” several derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the company and current and former officers and directors these actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive settlement two former officers of the company were also named as defendants in an sec enforcement action which has been settled 

no assurance can be given that additional actions will not be filed against the company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices if such actions are filed and result in adverse findings the remedies could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to the company’s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into material settlements should the company fail to prevail in certain matters or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health safety and environmental protection 

the company’s products and services and the production and distribution of those goods and services are subject to a variety of laws and regulations these may require the company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company 

  

operates including various countries within europe and asia and certain states and provinces within north america although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the focus of such laws there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

changes in the company’s tax rates the adoption of new us tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of marketable securities allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software thirdparty digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue for software products operating system software and applications software or any product that is considered to be softwarerelated in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions eg mac computers iphones and ipod portable digital music and video players for products that are not software or softwarerelated eg thirdparty digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac iphone and ipod supplies and accessories the company recognizes revenue pursuant to various revenuerelated gaap as described below 

the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not or is presumed not to be fixed or determinable revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

for both iphone and apple tv the company has indicated it may from timetotime provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers accordingly iphone handsets and apple tv sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with gaap as such the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale and are both recognized on a straightline basis over the currently estimated 24month economic lives of these products with any loss recognized at the time of sale if the company’s estimated economic life of a product accounted for under subscription accounting changes the 

  

future rate at which deferred revenue and deferred costs are recognized in the company’s results of operations will change costs incurred by the company for engineering sales marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

the company’s investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax as reported in the company’s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of investments impact the company’s net income only when such investments are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company’s intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis the company’s assessment on whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired or not could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty distributors cellular network carriers and resellers and directly to certain education consumer and enterprise customers the company generally does not require collateral from its customers however the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk in addition when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america europe asia and australia or by requiring thirdparty financing loans or leases to support credit exposure these creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer as such the company generally does not assume any recourse or creditrisksharing related to any of these arrangements however considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners 

  

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the ability to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the creditworthiness and financial condition of those specific customers the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the general economic environment the financial condition of the company’s distribution channels and the aging of such receivables if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts which would affect its results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the personal computer mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary for products accounted for under subscription accounting the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company’s results of operations 

the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software’s compliance with specifications the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered the number of updates expected to occur and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 

  

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with gaap the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

the company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap whereby the company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in note 8 “commitments and contingencies” in notes to consolidated financial statements the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with gaap the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in management’s opinion the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results however the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

americas 

during 2009 net sales in the americas segment increased 16 billion or 11 compared to 2008 the increase in net sales during 2009 was attributable to the significant yearoveryear increase in iphone revenue higher sales of thirdparty digital content and applications from the itunes store and increased sales of mac portable systems which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of mac desktop systems and ipods americas mac net sales decreased 6 due primarily to lower average selling prices while mac unit sales increased by 4 on a yearoveryear basis the increase in mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for the macbook pro which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008 the americas segment represented approximately 44 and 45 of the company’s total net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

during 2008 net sales in the americas segment increased 30 billion or 26 compared to 2007 the primary drivers of this growth were the significant yearoveryear increase in sales of the ipod touch mac portable systems content from the itunes store and iphone the company began shipping iphone in june 2007 and the growth in iphone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iphone shipments as well as stronger demand for iphones in the fourth quarter of 2008 the increase in mac net sales of 13 billion or 30 and mac unit sales of 961 million or 32 is attributable to growth in sales of all of the mac portable systems particularly the macbook and higher sales of the imac net sales of ipods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced ipods particularly the ipod touch which was upgraded in june 2008 in 2008 the americas segment represented 45 of the company’s total net sales as compared to 48 in the same period of 2007 

europe 

during 2009 net sales in europe increased 17 billion or 23 compared to 2008 the increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iphone revenue and mac portable systems offset partially by lower net sales of mac desktop systems ipods and a stronger us dollar mac unit sales increased 13 in 2009 compared to 2008 which was driven primarily by increased sales of mac portable systems particularly macbook pro while total mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all mac products although ipod net sales decreased in europe yearoveryear as a result of lower average selling prices ipod unit sales increased due to ipod touch and market share increases the europe segment represented 26 and 23 of total net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

europe’s net sales and mac unit sales increased 40 and 39 respectively during 2008 compared to 2007 the main drivers of this growth were strong sales of mac portable systems and imac increased sales from the itunes store and iphone also contributing to the increase in net sales were higher ipod net sales due primarily to the ipod touch which was upgraded in june 2008 sales of mac portable products increased due to stronger demand for the macbook pro and the macbook both updated in february 2008 as well as sales of the macbook air introduced in january 2008 mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the imac which was updated in april 2008 the europe segment represented 23 of total net sales in 2008 consistent with 2007 

japan 

japan’s net sales increased 322 million or 21 in 2009 compared to 2008 the key contributors to this growth were increased iphone revenue stronger demand for certain mac portable systems and ipods and strength in the japanese yen partially offset by decreased sales of mac desktop systems net sales and unit sales of mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven primarily by stronger demand for macbook pro which was updated in june 2009 and october 2008 net sales and unit sales of ipods increased during 2009 compared to 2008 driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano 

japan net sales increased 427 million or 39 in 2008 compared to 2007 the primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of ipods imac mac portable systems and strong sales from the itunes store net sales unit sales and the average selling price of ipods increased during 2008 compared to 2007 driven by 

  

strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano additionally mac net sales and unit sales grew 42 and 29 respectively in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of imac and mac portable systems particularly macbook as well as the introduction of macbook air in january 2008 

retail 

retail net sales increased 259 million or 4 during 2009 compared to 2008 the growth in net sales was driven largely by increased iphone revenue and mac portable systems offset partially by a decrease in sales of ipods and mac desktop systems the company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009 including a total of 14 international stores ending the year with 273 stores open this compares to 247 stores open as of september 27 2008 and 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 

the yearoveryear growth rate of retail net sales was less than the increase in the average number of stores open during the same period which the company believes reflects the challenging consumerspending environment and continued thirdparty channel expansion particularly in the us where most of its stores are located with an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008 respectively average revenue per store decreased to 259 million for 2009 from 299 million in 2008 

the retail segment’s net sales grew by 53 during 2008 compared to 2007 due in large part to increased sales of mac portable and desktop systems strong demand for the iphone and ipod touch and new store openings the company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008 bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of september 27 2008 this compares to 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 with an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007 respectively average revenue per store increased to 299 million for 2008 from 231 million in 2007 

as measured by the company’s operating segment reporting the retail segment reported operating income of 14 billion during 2009 as compared to operating income of 13 billion and 875 million during 2008 and 2007 respectively this increase in operating income in 2009 was driven by increased total retail net sales attributable to a 20 increase in average stores open and higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced companywide the retail segment’s operating income increased by 462 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant retail net sales growth of 53 as compared to 2007 

expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure operating lease commitments personnel and other operating expenses capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment were 369 million in 2009 bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the retail segment to 18 billion as of september 26 2009 the retail segment had approximately 16500 fulltime equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of 15 billion the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

other segments 

the company’s other segments which consist of its asia pacific and filemaker operations experienced an increase in net sales of 165 million or 7 during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iphone and mac portable systems offset partially by a decline in sales related to ipods and mac desktop systems in the asia pacific region as well as a strengthening of the us dollar against the australian dollar and other asian currencies mac net sales and unit sales grew in the asia pacific region by 4 and 17 respectively due to increased sales of the macbook pro 

the company’s other segments experienced an increase in net sales of 707 million or 40 during 2008 as compared to 2007 these increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all mac portable systems 

  

ipods the imac and content from the itunes store in the company’s asia pacific region sales from the itunes store in the company’s asia pacific region grew 109 compared to 2007 

gross margin 

gross margin for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 the gross margin percentage in 2009 was 360 compared to 343 in 2008 the primary drivers of the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were significantly lower commodity and other product costs and a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins which were partially offset by product price reductions gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 

the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2009 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 34 in the first quarter of 2010 this expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and both expected and potential future cost increases for key components 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage are forwardlooking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i item 1a “risk factors” under the subheading “ future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities ” which is incorporated herein by reference there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” and liquid crystal displays “lcds” as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to these competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the three years ended september 26 2009 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

   

research and development “rd” 

rd expenditures increased 20 or 224 million to 13 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount and higher stockbased compensation expenses in the current year to support expanded rd activities in addition 71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from rd expense during 2009 compared to 11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008 although total rd expense increased 20 during 2009 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 12 increase in revenue in 2009 the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to make further investments in rd to remain competitive 

expenditures for rd increased 42 or 327 million to 11 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2008 and higher stockbased compensation expenses in 2008 11 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from rd expense while rd expense for 2007 excluded 75 million of capitalized software development costs related to mac os x leopard and iphone software although total rd expense increased 42 during 2008 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35 increase in revenue during 2008 

selling general and administrative expense “sga” 

sga expenditures increased 388 million or 10 to 41 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these increases are due primarily to the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets higher stockbased compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising 

expenditures for sga increased 798 million or 27 to 38 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases are due primarily to higher stockbased compensation expenses higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant yearoveryear increase in total net sales and the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets in addition the company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007

 total other income and expense decreased 294 million or 47 to 326 million during 2009 compared to 620 million and 599 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 partially offset by the company’s higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 143 344 and 527 during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense

as of september 26 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of september 27 2008 related primarily to longterm marketable securities the company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature the unrealized losses on the company’s marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates specifically widening credit spreads the company does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not the company will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis accordingly no material declines in fair value were recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of operations during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management the company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009 2008 and 2007 related to such sales 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were 29 30 and 30 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the company’s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

as of september 26 2009 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 32 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of 18 billion for presentation on the company’s consolidated balance sheet management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the financial accounting standards boards “fasb” amended the accounting standards codification “asc” as summarized in accounting standards update “asu” 200914 software topic 985 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu 200913 revenue recognition topic 605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  as summarized in asu 200914 asc topic 985 has been amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality as summarized in asu 200913 asc topic 605 has been amended 1 to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 2 to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” or thirdparty evidence of selling price and 3 to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method the accounting changes summarized in asu 200914 and asu 200913 are both effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 with early adoption permitted adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 

  

the company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments to the asc on its accounting and reporting systems and processes however at this time the company is unable to quantify the impact on its financial statements of its adoption or determine the timing and method of its adoption as of september 26 2009 total iphone and apple tv deferred revenue and deferred costs were 121 billion and 52 billion respectively the company believes that application of these amendments will result in a substantial portion of the revenue associated with the sale of iphone and apple tv and all related cost of sales being recognized at the time of sale currently revenue and associated cost of sales for these products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the currently estimated 24month economic life of the products 

during the first quarter of 2009 the company adopted fasb asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures formerly referenced as statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 fair value measurements   which defines fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb issued supplemental guidance that delays the effective date of this new fair value accounting standard to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually and will be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of 2010 although the company will continue to evaluate the application of this accounting standard management does not currently believe adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or operating results 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fasb asc 805 business combinations formerly referenced as sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination this new accounting standard also establishes principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination in april 2009 the fasb amended this new accounting standard to require that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period this new business combination accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and will be adopted by the company beginning in the first quarter of 2010 and will apply prospectively to any business combinations completed on or after that date the effect of adoption of this new accounting pronouncement on the company’s financial condition or operating results will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended september 26 2009 in millions 

 

 as of september 26 2009 the company had 340 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities an increase of 95 billion from september 27 2008 the principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of 102 billion which was partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property plant and equipment of 11 billion the company’s cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the increase in deferred revenue net of deferred costs associated with subscription accounting for iphone 

  

the company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities generally with a minimum rating of singlea or equivalent as of september 26 2009 and september 27 2008 174 billion and 113 billion respectively of the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in us dollardenominated holdings the company believes its existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs capital asset purchases outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months 

capital assets 

the company’s cash payments for capital asset purchases were 11 billion during 2009 consisting of 369 million for retail store facilities and 775 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements the company anticipates utilizing approximately 19 billion for capital asset purchases during 2010 including approximately 400 million for retail facilities and approximately 15 billion for corporate facilities infrastructure and product tooling and manufacturing process equipment 

historically the company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year during 2010 the company expects to open a number of new stores near the upper end of this range over half of which are expected to be located outside of the us 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company 

the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 26 2009 and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities in millions 

 

 lease commitments 

as of september 26 2009 the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of 19 billion 15 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities the company’s major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20 years the majority of which are for ten years and often contain multiyear renewal options 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers 

the company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for the company’s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products these contract manufacturers acquire components 

  

and build product based on demand information supplied by the company which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information such purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days in addition the company has an offbalance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting whereby the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred as of september 26 2009 the company had outstanding offbalance sheet thirdparty manufacturing commitments component purchase commitments and estimated warranty commitments of 48 billion 

the company has entered into prepaid longterm supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components during the first quarter of 2009 a longterm supply agreement with intel corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of 167 million was repaid to the company during the second and fourth quarters of 2009 the company made a prepayment of 500 million to lg display for the purchase of lcd panels and a prepayment of 500 million to toshiba to purchase nand flash memory respectively as of september 26 2009 the company had a total of 12 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding 

asset retirement obligations 

the company’s asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination as of september 26 2009 the company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of 32 million would be required to fulfill these obligations 

other obligations 

other outstanding obligations were 356 million as of september 26 2009 which related to advertising research and development internet and telecommunications services and other obligations 

as of september 26 2009 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 971 million and an additional 291 million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between 105 million and 145 million in the next 12 months at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

indemnifications 

the company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified thirdparty however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty and in the opinion of management does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results therefore the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either september 26 2009 or september 27 2008 

the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such 

  

individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the company’s financial condition or operating results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures however given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates in addition the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to marktomarket instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries the company’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates as such changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the fair value of those investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

the company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company a portion of the company’s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company’s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks the company’s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the company’s investment policy requires investments to be investment grade primarily rated singlea or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents the company classifies its marketable securities as either shortterm or longterm based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date all shortterm marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months while all longterm marketable securities have maturities ranging from one to five years the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management the company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009 2008 and 2007 related to such sales 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 26 2009 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 176 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september 27 2008 a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a 46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

  

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries generally the company’s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for three to six months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to immateriality accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 44 million as of september 26 2009 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 60 million as of september 27 2008 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 26 2009 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business the markets for consumer electronics personal computers related software and peripheral products digital music devices and related services and mobile communication devices are highly competitive these markets are characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers other digital electronic devices and mobile communication devices that have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price feature and performance characteristics over the past several years price competition in these markets has been particularly intense the company’s competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins the principal competitive factors include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation availability of software and peripherals marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation further as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller simpler and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete with the company’s products 

the company’s music products and services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services the company believes it currently retains a competitive advantage by offering superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware personal computer ipod and iphone software itunes and distribution of content itunes store and itunes wifi music store however the company expects competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to tightly integrating these elements within their own offerings or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer some of these current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company’s offerings 

the company is currently focused on market opportunities related to mobile communication devices including the iphone the mobile communications industry is highly competitive with several large wellfunded and experienced competitors the company faces competition from mobile communication device companies that may attempt to imitate some of the iphone’s functions and applications within their own smart phones this industry is characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s future financial condition and operating results are substantially dependent on the company’s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of its markets 

raw materials 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors enclosures certain lcds certain optical drives and applicationspecific integrated circuits “asics” are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations in addition the company has entered into certain agreements for 

  

the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable pricing but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms or at all upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages andor price increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results 

the company and other participants in the personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communication industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured if the company’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

significant portions of the company’s mac computers ipods iphones logic boards and other assembled products are manufactured by outsourcing partners primarily in various parts of asia a significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the company’s outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the company’s key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the company’s portable mac computers ipods iphones and most of the company’s imacs although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days 

the company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business and financial condition at this time such vendors include without limitation amperex technology limited asustek corporation ati technologies inc atheros communications inc au optronics corporation broadcom corporation chi mei optoelectronics corporation cypress semiconductor corporation hitachi global storage technologies hon hai precision industry co ltd infineon technologies ag intel corporation inventec appliances corporation lg display lsi corporation matsushita murata manufacturing co ltd national semiconductor corporation nvidia corp inc quanta computer inc renesas semiconductor co ltd samsung electronics sony corporation synaptics inc texas instruments and toshiba corporation 

research and development 

because the personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communication industries are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of computer hardware and peripherals consumer electronics products mobile communication devices system software applications software networking and communications software and solutions and internet services and solutions the company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing andor acquisition of thirdparty business and technology the company’s research and development expenditures totaled 11 billion 782 million and 712 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively

the company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a portfolio of several thousand issued patents in the us and worldwide in addition the company currently holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company’s products the company believes the duration of the applicable patents that it has been granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products due to the fast pace of innovation and product development the company’s products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods the company believes based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all because of technological changes in the computer digital music player and mobile communications industries current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data

seasonal business

original enduser the company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company’s hardware products in addition consumers may purchase the applecare protection plan which extends service coverage on many of the company’s hardware products in most of its major markets 

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

environmental laws 

compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company 

production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various countries within europe and asia certain canadian provinces and certain states within the us although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or operating results

 item 1a risk factors 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit negative financial news andor declines in income or asset values which could have a material negative effect on the demand for the company’s products and services demand could also differ materially from the company’s expectations since the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the us to offset the effect of the strengthening of the us dollar a trend which has been very pronounced recently other factors that could influence demand include continuing increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services and on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on the company’s business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the company’s treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges 

  

related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates cash balances and changes in fair value of derivative instruments the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on the company’s financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of the company’s stock price 

the matters relating to the company’s past stock option practices and the restatement of the company’s consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation 

the findings from the company’s investigation into its past stock option granting practices and the resulting restatement of prior financial statements in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year september 30 2006 the “2006 form 10k” have exposed the company to greater risks associated with litigation regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in state and federal courts against the company and certain current and former directors and executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to past stock option grants the company has provided the results of its investigation to the securities and exchange commission the “sec” and the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of california and the company has responded to their requests for documents and additional information the company intends to continue to provide its full cooperation 

on april 24 2007 the sec filed an enforcement action against two former officers of the company in announcing the lawsuit the sec stated that it would not bring an enforcement action against the company based in part on the company’s “swift extensive and extraordinary cooperation in the commission’s investigation” according to the sec’s statement the company’s “cooperation consisted of among other things prompt selfreporting an independent internal investigation the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government and the implementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct” the enforcement actions against each of these former officers have now been settled 

no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation relating to the company’s past stock option practices these and related matters have required and will continue to require the company to incur substantial expenses for legal accounting tax and other professional services and may divert management’s attention from the company’s business if the company is subject to adverse findings it could be required to pay damages and penalties and might face additional remedies that could harm its financial condition and operating results 

global markets for personal computers digital music devices mobile communication devices and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company competes in global markets that are highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price cutting with its resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers 

the company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of new innovative products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its personal computers consumer electronics and mobile communication devices including the hardware operating system several software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks by contrast many of the company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies 

  

infringe on the company’s intellectual property the company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and have a materially adverse affect on its financial condition and operating results 

in the market for personal computers and peripherals the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed customer bases consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins the company also faces increased competition in key market segments including consumer smb education enterprise government and creative markets an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company’s existing products 

the company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the mac os the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market which is dominated by makers of computers using competing operating systems most notably windows the company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company’s ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain design and functional advantages use of unauthorized copies of the mac os on other companies’ hardware products may result in decreased demand for the company’s hardware products and could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is currently focused on certain mobile communication devices such as iphone consumer electronic devices including the ipod family of digital music players and digital content distribution the company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships the company has only recently entered the mobile communications market and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have significantly greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain digital content because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company’s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions 

there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively 

to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communication industries the company must continually introduce new products and technologies enhance existing products and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including timely and successful product development market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results 

the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk 

the company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying 

  

value of the assets exceeds its fair market value although the company believes its inventory asset and related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communication industries the company will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges have had and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days because the company’s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products the company’s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the company’s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to shortterm shifts in customer demand patterns 

future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities 

because the company currently obtains certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors enclosures certain lcds certain optical drives and asics from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dram and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable pricing but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms or at all upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages andor price increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007 due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures both expected and potential future cost increases for key components and higher logistical costs for additional information refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the subheading “gross margin” which is incorporated herein by reference 

the company and other participants in the personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communication industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer consumer electronics or mobile communication industries the company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements if the supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties many of whom are located outside of the us 

most of the company’s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few thirdparty manufacturers many of these manufacturers are located outside of the us and are geographically concentrated 

  

in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions in addition the company relies on thirdparty manufacturers to adhere to the company’s supplier code of conduct although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation financial condition and operating results 

final assembly of the company’s products is currently performed in the company’s manufacturing facility in ireland and by external vendors in california korea china and the czech republic currently the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by solesourced thirdparty vendors in the us china japan korea malaysia philippines taiwan thailand and singapore solesourced thirdparty vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the company’s portable products including macbook pro macbook macbook air ipods iphones and most of the company’s imacs if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason including natural disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

the company relies on thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the company’s itunes store the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio and video content the company’s licensing arrangements with these third parties are shortterm and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some thirdparty content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company’s access to or increase the total cost of such content if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach the company’s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

many thirdparty content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management “drm” and other security solutions if these requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the company’s content providers 

the company relies on access to thirdparty patents and intellectual property and the company’s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights 

many of the company’s products are designed to include thirdparty intellectual property and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods although the company believes that based on past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all 

because of technological changes in the global personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communication industries current extensive patent coverage and the rapid issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights regardless of merit responding to such claims can consume significant time and 

  

expense at present the company is vigorously defending more than 21 patent infringement cases 13 of which were filed during fiscal 2008 and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur if the company is found to be infringing such rights it may be required to pay substantial damages if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology while in management’s opinion the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

with the june 2007 introduction of iphone the company has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors the company may have to engage in protracted litigation enter into expensive agreements or settlements andor modify its products any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s future performance depends on support from thirdparty software developers if thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company’s products customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products including its macs ipods and iphones are often based to a certain extent on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services there is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the company’s products on a timely basis or at all and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products compared to windowsbased products this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated continued acceptance by customers of mac os x and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company’s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company’s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market the company’s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of thirdparty developers such as microsoft adobe and google to develop maintain and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the company’s products mac os x leopard which became available in october 2007 includes a new feature that enables intelbased mac systems to run microsoft windows xp and windows vista operating systems this feature may deter developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such applications are already available for the windows platform 

with respect to iphone and ipod touch the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications as with applications for the company’s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers’ perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company’s products rather than its competitors’ including devices that use competing platforms if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company’s devices may suffer 

  

the company’s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin 

the company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue harm to reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 

the company’s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels the company’s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company’s other products gross margins on the company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company’s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix new products component cost increases or price competition the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year respectively furthermore the company sells more products from timetotime during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s key logistics components supply or manufacturing partners could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

in certain countries including the us the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone 

in the us uk france germany spain ireland and certain other countries the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis if these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers in their markets for any reason including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services performance and timely buildout of advanced wireless networks and pricing and other terms of conditions of enduser contracts or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans sales may be materially adversely affected 

the company is subject to risks associated with laws regulations and industryimposed standards related to mobile communications devices 

laws and regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production manufacture distribution and use of the device locking the device to a carrier’s network or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier’s network could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

mobile communication devices such as iphone are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

the company may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt the company’s operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer including channel partner orders negatively affecting the company’s online offerings and services impeding the manufacture or shipment of products processing transactions and reporting financial results resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information or damage to the company’s reputation while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s stock price continues to be volatile 

the company’s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results announcements by the company and its competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline 

political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company’s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company’s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are located near major seismic faults because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 

the company’s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 

much of the company’s future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including its ceo its executive team and key employees in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley where most of the company’s key employees are located the company has relied on equity awards as one means for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stockbased compensation expense which has caused the company to reduce the number of stockbased awards issued to employees and could negatively impact the company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel additionally significant adverse volatility in the company’s stock price could result in a stock option’s exercise price exceeding the underlying stock’s market value or a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units “rsus” granted thus lessening the 

  

effectiveness of retaining employees through stockbased awards there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company 

the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of its merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to the company’s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into material settlements should the company fail to prevail in certain matters or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

the company derives a large and growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations as a result its financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties 

the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to nonus dollar denominated sales in europe japan australia canada and certain parts of asia as well as nonus dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company’s products in some circumstances due to competition or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar’s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies while generally beneficial to the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing thereby limiting the benefit as strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies 

the company has used derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option positions to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

the company’s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

through september 27 2008 the company had opened 247 retail stores the company’s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from 5 to 20 years the majority of which are for 10 years certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company’s more typical retail stores due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the retail segment’s future results cause its actual results to differ from anticipated results and have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results these risks and uncertainties include among other things macroeconomic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity as well as the company’s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation inability to sell thirdparty products at adequate margins failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers 

the company distributes its products through wholesalers resellers national and regional retailers valueadded resellers and cataloguers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells many of its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to endusers certain education customers and certain resellers through its online and retail stores iphone is distributed through the company its cellular network carriers’ distribution channels and certain thirdparty resellers 

many resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens if resellers stopped distributing the company’s products or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

although the company has not recognized any material losses on its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results given the global nature of its business the company has investments both domestically and internationally additionally the company’s overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in the financial sector which has been negatively impacted by the recent market liquidity conditions credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments could decline and result in a material impairment which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company also has unsecured nontrade receivables resulting from the sale by the company of components to vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of nand flash memory while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health safety and environmental protection 

the company’s products and services and the production and distribution of those goods and services are subject to a variety of laws and regulations these may require the company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various countries within europe and asia certain canadian provinces and certain states within the us although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

changes in the company’s tax rates could affect its future results 

the company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance 

for certain risks the company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost andor availability because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks and in some cases selfinsures completely unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts 

  

reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs stockbased compensation income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software music products digital content peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue for software products operating system software and applications software or any product that is considered to be softwarerelated in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force “eitf” no 035 applicability of aicpa statement of position 972 to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing morethanincidental software  eg mac computers ipod portable digital music players and iphone pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement of position “sop” no 972 software revenue recognition  as amended for products that are not software or softwarerelated eg digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac ipod and iphone supplies and accessories the company recognizes revenue pursuant to the securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not or is presumed not to be fixed or determinable revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

for both apple tv and iphone the company has indicated that from timetotime it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers therefore sales of apple tv and iphone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with sop no 972 the company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straightline basis over the currently estimated 24month economic lives of these products with any loss recognized at the time of sale costs incurred by the company for engineering sales marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company’s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at 

  

which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty distributors and resellers and directly to certain education consumer and enterprise customers the company generally does not require collateral from its customers however the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk in addition when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america europe asia and australia and by arranging with thirdparty financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the company’s direct customers these creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer as such the company generally does not assume any recourse or creditrisksharing related to any of these arrangements however considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral thirdparty flooring arrangements or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the general economic environment the financial condition of the company’s distribution channels and the aging of such receivables if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the personal computer consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the writedowns were recorded 

the company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

  

warranty costs 

the company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no 972 the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the company’s results of operations 

the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software’s compliance with specifications the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered the number of updates expected to occur and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 

stockbased compensation 

the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fairvalue as calculated by the blackscholesmerton “bsm” optionpricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straightline basis over the requisite service period the bsm optionpricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility forfeiture rates and expected option life significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stockbased awards granted in the future 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized effective at the beginning of 2008 the company adopted financial interpretation no “fin” 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  further information may be found in note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of fin 48 and other complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

legal and other contingencies 

as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” and in note 8 “commitments and contingencies” in notes to consolidated financial statements the company is subject to 

  

various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  the company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in management’s opinion the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results however the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

during 2007 net sales in the americas segment increased 22 billion or 23 compared to 2006 the main sources of this growth were mac portable products imacs ipods and the sales of thirdparty content from the itunes store sales of mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the macbook introduced in may 2006 and updated in may 2007 as well as the macbook pro introduced in january 2006 and updated in june 2007 sales of imacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the mac mini and discontinued emac as well as the strong reception of the new imac introduced in august 2007 sales of ipods grew due to increased demand for the ipod nano and ipod shuffle and the introduction of the ipod touch in september 2007 during 2007 the americas segment represented 48 of the company’s total net sales as compared to 49 in the same period of 2006 during 2007 us education channel net sales and mac unit sales increased by 14 and 18 respectively compared to 2006 net sales from the higher education market grew 17 during 2007 compared to 2006 while net sales in the k12 market grew 10 during the same period

europe segment net sales increased 14 billion or 33 during 2007 compared to 2006 consistent with the americas segment the primary drivers of this growth were mac portable products imacs ipods and the sales of thirdparty content from the itunes store sales of mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the macbook and macbook pro sales of imacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the mac mini and discontinued emac as well as the strong reception of the new imac introduced in august 2007 sales of ipods grew due primarily to increased demand for the ipod nano and ipod shuffle the company believes that the growth in itunes store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of thirdparty audio and video content available for sale via the itunes store 

japan 

japan net sales increased 427 million or 39 in 2008 compared to 2007 the primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of ipods imac mac portable systems and strong sales from the itunes store net sales unit sales and the average selling price of ipods increased during 2008 compared to 2007 driven by strong demand for ipod touch and ipod nano additionally mac net sales and unit sales grew 42 and 29 respectively in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increase in sales of the imac and mac portable systems particularly macbook as well as the introduction of macbook air in january 2008 

  

japan’s net sales declined by 129 million or 11 in 2007 compared to 2006 total mac unit sales in japan declined 1 during 2007 the decrease in the japan segment’s overall net sales was attributable primarily to decreases in ipod and mac desktop sales partially offset by an increase in revenue from macbooks and sales of thirdparty content from the itunes store the decline in net sales and mac unit sales is partially attributable to japan’s declining consumer pc market and the ipod sales decline is due primarily to lower average selling prices the company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve the future results of its japan segment 

retail 

retail net sales grew by 53 during 2008 compared to 2007 due in large part to increased sales of mac portable and desktop products strong demand for the iphone and ipod touch and new store openings the company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008 including a total of 19 international stores bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of september 27 2008 this compares to 197 open stores as of september 29 2007 and 165 open stores as of september 30 2006 with an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007 respectively average revenue per store increased to 299 million for 2008 compared to 231 million in 2007

gross margin for the three fiscal years ended september 27 2008 are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

 gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 gross margin percentage of 340 in 2007 increased significantly from 290 in 2006 the primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components including nand flash memory and dram memory higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the company’s direct sales channels 

the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30 in 2009 this expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures both expected and potential future cost increases for key components a stronger us dollar and higher logistical costs 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage are forwardlooking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i item 1a “risk factors” under the subheading “ future operating results depend upon the company’s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities ” which is incorporated herein by reference there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved in general gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” and liquid crystal displays “lcds” as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins in response to these competitive pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended september 27 2008 are as follows in millions except for percentages 

 

 research and development “rd” 

expenditures for rd increased 42 or 327 million to 11 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases were due primarily to an increase in rd headcount in the current year to support expanded rd activities and higher stockbased compensation expenses in 2008 11 million of software development costs were capitalized 

  

related to mac os x version 106 snow leopard and excluded from rd expense while rd expense for 2007 excluded 75 million of capitalized software development costs related to mac os x leopard and iphone although total rd expense increased 42 during 2008 it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35 increase in revenue during 2008 the company continues to believe that focused investments in rd are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company’s core business strategy as such the company expects to increase spending in rd to remain competitive 

expenditures for rd increased 10 or 70 million to 782 million in 2007 compared to 2006 the increases in rd expense were due primarily to an increase in rd headcount in 2007 to support expanded rd activities partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above 

selling general and administrative expense “sga” 

expenditures for sga increased 798 million or 27 to 38 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases are due primarily to higher stockbased compensation expenses higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant yearoveryear increase in total net sales and the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets in addition the company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007 

expenditures for sga increased 530 million or 22 during 2007 compared to 2006 the increase was due primarily to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant yearoveryear increase in total net sales in 2007 the company’s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets and higher spending on marketing and advertising partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007 

other income and expense

 total other income and expense increased 21 million to 620 million during 2008 as compared to 599 million and 365 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively while the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances increased by 59 in 2008 other income and expense increased only 4 due to the decline in the weighted average interest rate earned of 344 the overall increase in other income and expense is attributable to the company’s higher cash and shortterm investment balances which more than offset the decline in interest rates during 2008 as compared to 2007 the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 527 and 458 during 2007 and 2006 respectively during 2008 2007 and 2006 the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rates were 30 for the years ended september 27 2008 and september 29 2007 and 29 for the year ended september 30 2006 the company’s effective rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

as of september 27 2008 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 21 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities for presentation on the company’s balance sheet management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including 

  

income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets the company released a valuation allowance of 5 million since it has been determined that it is more likely than not the associated deferred tax assets will be realized the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 

the internal revenue service the “irs” has completed its field audit of the company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments the company has contested certain of these adjustments through the irs appeals office all irs audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved in addition the company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs

the company believes its existing balances of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs capital expenditures outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months

the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 27 2008 and excludes amounts already recorded on the company’s balance sheet as current liabilities in millions 

 

 lease commitments

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers 

the company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for the company’s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information such purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days in addition the company has an offbalance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no 972 whereby the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred as of september 27 2008 the company had outstanding offbalance sheet thirdparty manufacturing commitments component purchase commitments and estimated warranty commitments of 54 billion

other obligations 

other outstanding obligations were 471 million as of september 27 2008 which related to advertising research and development internet and telecommunications services and other obligations 

during the first quarter of 2008 the company adopted the provisions of fin 48 the company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities but beginning with the adoption of fin 48 the company has reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as noncurrent liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet as of september 27 2008 the company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of 506 million and gross interest and penalties of 219 million both of which are classified as noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

indemnifications 

the company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified thirdparty however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty and in the opinion of management does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results therefore the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either september 27 2008 or september 29 2007 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures however given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates in addition the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to marktomarket instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

interest rate risk 

while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries the company’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates as such changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the value of those investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

the company’s shortterm investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements a portion of the company’s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company’s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark the company’s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance allowing for differences in liquidity needs 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated singlea or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash 

  

equivalents while highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as shortterm investments as of september 27 2008 and september 29 2007 approximately 24 billion and 19 billion respectively of the company’s shortterm investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years the remainder all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management the company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2008 2007 and 2006 related to such sales 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 27 2008 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september 29 2007 a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a 16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries generally the company’s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for three to six months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk “var” model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 60 million as of september 27 2008 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 13 million as of september 29 2007 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 27 2008 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions

competition 

the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business the market for personal computers and related software and peripheral products is highly competitive this market continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price feature and performance characteristics over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense the company’s competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company’s results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins 

the principal competitive factors in the market for personal computers include price relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation availability of software product features marketing and distribution capability service and support availability of hardware peripherals and corporate reputation further as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller simpler and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the company’s existing products 

the company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of innovations from competing platforms the company’s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms 

the company’s services and products relating to music and other creative content have already encouraged significant competition from other companies many of whom have greater financial marketing and manufacturing resources than those of the company the company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services subscription services and free peertopeer music services the company anticipates that competition will intensify as hardware software and content providers work more collaboratively to offer integrated products competing with the company’s offerings however the company believes it currently maintains a competitive advantage by more effectively integrating an entire solution including the hardware ipod software itunes and distribution of thirdparty digital content itunes music store 

raw materials 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including microprocessors and applicationspecific integrated circuits “asics” are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources some other key components while currently available to the company from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide availability constraints and pricing pressures in addition the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components 

obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers if the supply of a key or singlesourced component to the company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the company the company’s ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected the company did experience such delays during 2004 and 2005 related to powerpc g5 processors which resulted in the constrained availability of certain products the company’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements in june 2005 the company announced its intention to transition its macintosh computers using the powerpc g5 and g4 microprocessors which are currently singlesourced to intel microprocessors by the end of calendar year 2007 the announcement of this transition may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services including powerpc g5 and g4 microprocessors the company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans strategic inventories coordinated product introductions and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information the company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days 

the company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business and financial position at this time such vendors include agere systems inc ambit microsystems corporation asustek corporation ati technologies inc broadcom corporation cypress semiconductor corporation freescale semiconductor inc hitachi global storage technologies hon hai precision industry co ltd ibm corporation intel corporation international display technology inventec appliances corporation lg phillips co ltd matsushita mitsubishi electric corporation nvidia corp portalplayer inc quanta computer inc samsung electronics synaptics inc and toshiba corporation 

research and development 

because the personal computer and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances the company’s ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace the company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals consumer electronic products system software applications software networking and communications software and solutions and the internet the company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing andor acquisition of thirdparty business and technology the company’s research and development expenditures totaled 534 million 489 million and 471 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

patents trademarks copyrights and licenses 

the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems ipods peripherals and software in addition the company has registered andor has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for “apple” the apple logo “macintosh” “ipod” “itunes” “itunes music store” and numerous other trademarks and service marks although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the 

ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from thirdparties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods the company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all because of technological changes in the computer industry current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of thirdparties 

foreign and domestic operations and geographic data

seasonal business 

the company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s future net sales or financial performance

backlog 

in the company’s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance 

environmental laws 

compliance with federal state local and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the company’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company 

production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the requirement that the company provide consumers with the ability to return to the company product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various european union member states japan and california in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the company’s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 

management believes the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs and income taxes management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition 

net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software peripherals digital content and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards including statement of position sop no 972 software revenue recognition  as amended and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 104 revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the us and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not or is presumed not to be fixed or determinable revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable 

the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and enduser rebates and other sales programs and volumebased incentives the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the company has sold the product and committed to the relevant program the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty resellers and directly to certain education consumer and commercial customers the company generally does not require collateral from its customers however when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america europe and asia and by arranging with thirdparty financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the company’s direct customers these creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer as such the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements however considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral thirdparty flooring arrangements or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible  the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the general economic environment the financial condition of the company’s distribution channels and the aging of such receivables if there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 

inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the personal computer and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional writedowns which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the writedowns are recorded 

the company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified 

warranty costs 

the company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company’s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the company’s results of operations 

income taxes 

the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 which if implemented by the company would affect the company’s tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made similarly if the company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable the respective valuation allowance would be reversed resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations and financial position

offsetting the favorable factors discussed above the company’s net sales during 2004 were negatively impacted by the following 

·   net sales and unit sales of imac systems were down 23 and 16 respectively during 2004 versus 2003 the decrease in imac net sales and unit sales was largely due to the delay in the introduction of the new imac based on the powerpc g5 processor primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by ibm the delays in the new imac resulted in the depletion of inventory of the old imac flat panel prior to availability of the new imac g5 the old flat panel imac form factor which was available during most of 2004 was nearly 3 years old by the time the new imac g5 began shipping in september 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product the company believes that sales of imac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and desktop models from competitors with price points below 1000

·   net sales and unit sales in the company’s japan segment decreased 3 and 14 respectively during 2004 versus 2003 the company believes these declines related to a shift in sales from the japan segment to the retail segment as a result of the tokyo and osaka store openings in 2004 declines in net sales in japan may have also related to delays in computer upgrades by certain professional and creative customers pending release in japan of certain mac os x native applications such as quark xpress 6 which did not become available until september 2004 when sales from the japan retail stores are included in the results for the japan segment the combined revenue in japan resulted in a 3 yearoveryear increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 see

americas 

during 2005 net sales in the americas segment grew 64 or 26 billion compared to 2004 the increase in net sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant yearoveryear increase in ipod sales sales of other music related products and services and strong sales of desktop and portable macintosh systems this increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the retail segment which had 117 stores in the us and canada as of the end of 2005 macintosh unit sales also increased by 30 in 2005 compared to 2004 driven primarily by strong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the new imac which began shipping in september 2004 and the mac mini which was introduced in january 2005 during 2005 and 2004 the americas segment represented approximately 47 and 49 respectively of the company’s total net sales and represented approximately 48 and 51 respectively of total macintosh unit sales as noted above the company experienced an increase in both us education channel net sales and unit sales of 21 for 2005 compared to 2004 strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong imac shipments portable system shipments and online sales this strength drove yearoveryear growth in net sales of 32 for the higher education channel during 2005 despite challenges in the k12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive pressures the company’s k12 net sales grew yearoveryear by 11 during 2005 due to increased ibook sales and 11 education sales 

during 2004 net sales in the americas segment grew 26 or 838 million compared to 2003 the increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable to the significant yearoveryear increase in ipod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals software and services this increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the retail segment which had 84 stores in the us as of the end of 2004 macintosh unit sales also increased by 4 in 2004 compared to 2003 driven primarily by strong sales of portable and power macintosh systems partially offset by weakness in imac sales during 2004 and 2003 the americas segment represented approximately 49 and 51 respectively of the company’s total net sales and represented approximately 51 and 54 respectively of total macintosh unit sales the company experienced an increase in us education channel net sales of 19 for 2004 compared to 2003 strong us education net sales for 2004 related primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful backtoschool selling season with strong demand for the company’s portables this strength drove yearoveryear growth in net sales of 40 for the higher education channel during 2004 the company’s k12 net sales grew yearoveryear by 3 during 2004 despite the challenges in the k12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition 

europe 

during 2005 net sales in the europe segment grew 13 billion or 71 from 2004 total macintosh unit sales in europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 47 in 2005 compared to 

2004 consistent with the americas segment europe experienced strong net sales of desktop products ipod other music related products and services and software and service sales demand in europe during 2005 was particularly strong for the company’s desktop computers which experienced a yearoveryear increase of 56 similar to the results of the company’s other segments net sales of ipods peripherals and software were strong in 2005 

net sales in europe rebounded in 2004 increasing 490 million or 37 from 2003 total macintosh unit sales in europe also experienced growth in 2004 by increasing 13 compared to 2003 consistent with the americas segment europe experienced strong net sales across all product lines except the imac systems demand in europe during 2004 was particularly strong for the company’s power macintosh systems and portable macintosh systems which experienced yearoveryear increases of 29 and 42 respectively similar to the results of the company’s other segments net sales of ipods peripherals and software were strong in 2004 over 2003 

japan 

japan’s net sales and macintosh unit sales were up 36 and 8 respectively during 2005 compared to 2004 japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products ipod and other music related products and services desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 31 and 41 respectively and ipod sales increased by 220 during 2005 compared to 2004 the overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004 which the company believes might be attributable to a shift in sales from portables to the new imac g5 and mac mini and a shift to the retail segment as a result of opening two additional stores in japan during 2005 

japan’s net sales and macintosh unit sales were down 3 and 14 respectively during 2004 compared to 2003 which lagged behind all of the company’s other operating segments these decreases in net sales and unit sales were believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the japan segment to the retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in japan in 2004 in addition such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of quark xpress 6 for mac os x which did not occur until september 2004 the decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong ipod and ibook sales during 2004 compared to 2003 

retail 

the company opened 38 new retail stores during 2005 including 6 international stores in the uk japan and canada bringing the total number of open stores to 124 as of september 24 2005 this compares to 86 open stores as of september 25 2004 and 65 open stores as of september 27 2003 

net sales of the retail segment grew to 24 billion during 2005 from 12 billion and 621 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the increases in net sales during both 2005 and 2004 reflect the impact of new store openings for each year including the opening of 38 new stores in 2005 and 21 new stores in 2004 an increase in average revenue per store also contributed to the segment’s strong sales in 2005 with an average of 105 stores open during 2005 the retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately 224 million as compared to 156 million in 2004 with a 76 store average and 115 million in 2003 with a 54 store average 

as measured by the company’s operating segment reporting the retail segment reported operating income of 151 million during 2005 as compared to operating income of 39 million during 2004 and an operating loss of 5 million during 2003 this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment’s yearoveryear increase in average revenue per store the impact of opening new stores and the segment’s yearoveryear increase in net sales which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy depreciation and other fixed costs 

expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure operating lease commitments personnel and other operating expenses capital expenditures associated with the retail segment were 132 million in 2005 bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the retail segment to approximately 529 million as of september 24 2005 the retail segment had approximately 3673 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately 606 million the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

gross margin 

gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows in millions except gross margin percentages 

 

  

gross margin increased in 2005 to 290 of net sales from 273 of net sales in 2004 the company’s gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including lcd flatpanel displays and dram memory an increase in higher margin software sales a favorable shift in direct sales related primarily to the company’s retail and online stores and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs these increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin ipod sales 

the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure in light of price competition especially for the ipod product line the company expects gross margin percentage to decline in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as the ipod and content from the itunes music store 

the foregoing statements regarding the company’s expected gross margin are forwardlooking there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved in general gross margins and margins on individual products including ipods will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services and potential changes to the company’s product mix including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins in response to these downward pressures the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company’s significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected in the shortterm by fluctuations in exchange rates 

the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments because the company’s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from thirdparties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components the company’s operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company’s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to shortterm shifts in customer demand patterns 

gross margin declined in 2004 to 273 of net sales from 275 of net sales in 2003 the company’s gross margin during 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin ipod and ibook sales pricing actions on certain power macintosh g5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004 higher warranty costs on certain portable macintosh products and higher freight and duty costs during 2004 these unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39 yearoveryear increase in higher margin software sales

interest and other income net 

total interest and other income net increased 112 million or 211 to 165 million during 2005 compared to 53 million in 2004 and 83 million in 2003 these increases are attributable primarily to increasing investment yields on the company’s cash and shortterm investments and higher invested balances the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased to 270 in 2005 compared to the 138 and 189 rates earned during 2004 and 2003 respectively the company occasionally sells shortterm investments prior to their stated maturities as a result of such sales the company recognized net losses of 137000 in 2005 and net gains of 1 million and 21 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively partially offsetting the increase in other income were higher foreign currency hedging expenses

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate for the year ended september 24 2005 was approximately 26 the company’s effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us research and development tax credits and a reduction of certain tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets the benefit from adjustments to tax contingency reserves and net deferred tax assets was 67 million in addition the company recorded a 25 million reduction of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that in management’s opinion are now more likely than not to be realized in the future 14 million of the valuation allowance reduction was recorded as a credit to income tax expense and the remainder was recorded as a credit to goodwill 

as of september 24 2005 the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 767 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the company’s balance sheet management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets as of september 24 2005 and september 25 2004 a valuation allowance of 5 million and 30 million respectively was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax loss carryforwards that may not be realized the remaining valuation allowance at september 24 2005 relates principally to certain state operating loss carryforwards the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance

ajca the legislation provided the company with the option to apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006 the company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and expects to complete the evaluation in 2006 a maximum of 755 million may be eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by ajca however given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the company’s continuing evaluation the company has not yet determined the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation

factors that may affect future results and financial condition 

because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company’s operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

general economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the company’s products and the financial health of its suppliers distributors and resellers 

the company’s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the us and abroad at times in the past demand for the company’s products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions additionally some of the company’s education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the company’s products and related operating results should global andor regional economic conditions deteriorate demand for the company’s products could be adversely affected as could the financial health of its suppliers distributors and resellers 

war terrorism public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply delivery or demand of products which could negatively affect the company’s operations and performance 

war terrorism public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the us or abroad have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy the company and the company’s suppliers or customers the company’s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake other natural disasters fire power shortages terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control the majority of the company’s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are located near major seismic faults because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quakerelated losses the company’s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster 

although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events such events could result in a decrease in demand for the company’s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers and could create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply chain in addition should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in the availability of freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the company’s operating results and financial condition have been and in the future may be adversely affected by these events 

the market for personal computers and related peripherals and services as well as digital music devices and related services is highly competitive if the company is unable to effectively compete in these markets its results of operations could be adversely affected 

the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors price sensitivity on the part of consumers and a large number of competitors over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell windows and linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal computing products the company’s results of operations and financial condition have been and in the future may continue to be adversely affected by these and other industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 

the personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality hardware performance and features based on existing or emerging industry standards further as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the internet an increasing number of internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the company’s existing products several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company’s key market segments including consumer education professional and consumer digital video editing and design and publishing several of the company’s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products andor online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design technical features and solutions of the company’s products the company has a significant number of competitors many of whom have greater financial marketing manufacturing and technological resources as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the company additionally there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the company’s markets 

the company is currently the only maker of hardware using the mac os the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems including windows and linux the company’s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms additionally if unauthorized copies of the mac os are used on other companies’ hardware products and result in decreased demand for the company’s hardware products the company’s results of operations may be adversely affected 

the company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices including ipods the company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products including music enabled cell phones distribution services and free peertopeer music services these competitors include both new entrants with different market approaches such as subscription services models and also larger companies that may have greater technical marketing distribution and other resources than those of the company as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the company’s operating results and financial position there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the us the company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices andor increasing features which could adversely affect the company’s music product gross margins as well as overall company gross margins 

the company also faces increased competition in the us education market us elementary and secondary schools as well as college and university customers remain a core market for the company uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers which could negatively affect the company’s market share in an effort to regain market share and remain competitive the company has been and will continue to pursue onetoone 11 learning solutions in education 11 learning solutions typically consist of ibook portable systems for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server these 11 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses particularly for larger deals although the company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the company’s operating results and financial condition 

the company’s transition from powerpc microprocessors used by macintosh computers to microprocessors built by intel is subject to numerous risks 

in june 2005 the company announced its intention to transition from the use of powerpc microprocessors to the use of intel microprocessors in all of its macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007 this transition is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including the company’s ability to timely develop and deliver new products using intel microprocessors the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware and software products including the company’s applications to support intel microprocessors market acceptance of intelbased macintosh computers the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the company to timely deliver intelbased macintosh computers and the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand for both powerpc and intelbased macintosh computers in addition the company is dependent on thirdparty software developers such as microsoft and adobe continuing to support current applications that run on powerpcbased computers and timely developing versions of current and future applications that run on intel and powerpcbased macintosh computers the company’s inability to timely deliver new intelbased products or obtain developer commitment both to continue supporting applications that run on powerpc microprocessors and timely transition their applications to run natively on intelbased products may have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations the company’s announcement of its intention to transition to intel microprocessors may negatively impact sales of current and future macintosh products containing powerpc microprocessors as customers may elect to delay purchases until the intelbased products are available additionally there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its historical gross margin percentages on its products including intelbased macintosh computers which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations 

future operating results are dependent upon the company’s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components including microprocessors some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including microprocessors and asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources some key components including without limitation dram nand flashmemory and tftlcd flatpanel displays while currently available to the company from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide availability and pricing pressures in addition new products introduced by the company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers in situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers’ yields have matured the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have 

experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the company’s requirements if the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s ability to produce and market competitive products is dependent on the ability and desire of ibm and freescale semiconductor inc freescale to supply powerpc microprocessors and intel to supply its microprocessors for the company’s macintosh computers and to provide the company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with priceperformance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the company’s competitors while the company has supply agreements with ibm and freescale the company’s recent announcement of plans to transition to intel microprocessors may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services including powerpc g4 and g5 microprocessors which are essential to the company’s business and are currently obtained by the company from sole or limited sources additionally there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the company’s suppliers to provide advanced powerpc microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the company’s results of operations in addition ibm is currently the company’s sole supplier of the powerpc g5 processor which is used in the company’s current power mac xserve and imac g5 products freescale is the sole supplier of the g4 processor which is used in the company’s emac mac mini and portable products ibm experienced manufacturing problems with the powerpc g5 processor which resulted in the company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 manufacturing problems experienced by any of the company’s suppliers in the future or failure by them to deliver components to the company in sufficient quantities with competitive priceperformance features could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand 

due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances the company must continually introduce new products and technologies enhance existing products in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the company’s existing products the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including market acceptance the company’s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions including the transition to intelbased macintosh computers and production ramp issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand including anticipated demand for powerpcbased and intelbased macintosh computers the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 

the company’s products from time to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits 

the company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from thirdparties there can be no assurance that the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells 

failure to do so could result in lost revenue loss of reputation and significant warranty and other expense to remedy 

because orders for components and in some cases commitments to purchase components must be placed in advance of customer orders the company faces substantial inventory risk 

the company records a writedown for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled although the company believes its inventory and related provisions are currently adequate given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the transition to intelbased macintosh computers no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges in addition such charges have had and may have a material effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments because the company’s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes and because of the transition to intelbased macintosh computers there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information such purchase commitments typically cover the company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days the company’s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company’s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to shortterm shifts in customer demand patterns 

the company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties many of whom are located outside of the us 

most of the company’s products are manufactured in whole or in part by thirdparty manufacturers in addition the company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations they also reduce the company’s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions moreover although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain at least initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise could adversely affect the company’s future operating results and financial condition 

final assembly of products sold by the company is currently performed in the company’s manufacturing facility in cork ireland and by external vendors in fremont california fullerton california taiwan korea the people’s republic of china and the czech republic currently manufacturing of many of the components used in the company’s products is performed by thirdparty vendors in taiwan china japan korea and singapore final assembly of substantially all of the company’s portable products including powerbooks ibooks and ipods is performed by thirdparty vendors in china if for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic business labor environmental public health or political issues as well as information technology system failures or military actions the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the company’s products 

the company distributes its products through wholesalers resellers national and regional retailers and cataloguers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers in addition the company sells many of its products and resells certain thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to end users certain education customers and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores many of the company’s resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by weak economic conditions over the last several years considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the company’s distribution and retail channel partners the company’s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the company’s products or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company’s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company’s products the company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers’ stores with company employees and contractors these programs could require a substantial investment from the company while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment 

over the past several years an increasing proportion of the company’s net sales has been made by the company directly to endusers through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the us canada japan and the uk some of the company’s resellers have perceived this expansion of the company’s direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the company’s products perception of such a conflict could discourage the company’s resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the company’s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the company’s products the company’s business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to endusers causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the company’s products 

further information regarding risks associated with marketing and distribution may be found in part i item 1 of this form 10k under the heading “markets and distribution” 

the company relies on thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers through the company’s itunes music store the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this thirdparty digital content the company’s licensing arrangements with these thirdparty content providers are shortterm in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms if at all certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed alliances which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the itunes music store further some thirdparty content providers currently or may in the future offer music products and services that compete with the company’s music products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their digital content in the future if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the us then sales and gross margins of the company’s itunes music store as well as related hardware and peripherals including ipods may be adversely affected 

thirdparty content providers and artists require that the company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms if the requirements from content providers or artists change then the company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements there is no assurance that the company will be able to develop or license 

such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if at all which could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial position 

the company’s future performance is dependent upon support from thirdparty software developers if thirdparty software applications cease to be developed or available for the company’s hardware products then customers may choose not to buy the company’s products 

the company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the company’s personal computers as opposed to windowsbased systems are often based on the availability of thirdparty software for particular applications such as microsoft office the company also believes the availability of thirdparty application software for the company’s hardware products depends in part on thirdparty developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company’s products versus software for the larger windows market or growing linux market this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated continued acceptance by customers of mac os x and the costs of developing such software products to the extent the minority market share held by the company in the personal computer market has caused software developers to question the company’s prospects in the personal computer market developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market or growing linux market moreover there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for mac os x the company’s operating system on a timely basis or at all 

in june 2005 the company announced its plan to begin using intel microprocessors in its macintosh computers the company plans to begin shipping certain models with intel microprocessors by june 2006 and to complete this transition to intel microprocessors for all of its macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007 the company depends on thirdparty software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run on intel and powerpc microprocessors the company’s inability to timely deliver new intelbased products or a decline in available applications that run on the company’s powerpc products or the lack of applications that run on intelbased macintosh systems could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial position 

in addition past and future development by the company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers such as microsoft and adobe to develop maintain and upgrade similar or competitive software for the company’s products the company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals consumers and education customers that could influence the decisions of thirdparty software developers to develop or upgrade macintoshcompatible software products software applications currently marketed by the company include software for professional film and video editing professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions professional music production and music post production professional and consumer dvd encoding and authoring professional digital photo editing and workflow management consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management digital music management desktopbased database management word processing and highquality presentations the company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing page layout image manipulation spreadsheets databases and presentations in a single application discontinuance of thirdparty products for the macintosh platform including microsoft office could have an adverse effect on the company’s net sales and results of operations 

the company’s business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties and the company’s future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 

many of the company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods the company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms 

because of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible certain components of the company’s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others the company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others responding to such claims regardless of their merit can be timeconsuming result in significant expenses and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases however no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a thirdparty the company’s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in part i item 3 of this form 10k in the opinion of management the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition however the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in part i item 3 of this form 10k or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

the company’s retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

through october 2005 the company had opened 126 retail stores the company’s retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years the majority of which are for 10 years the company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores such costs could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition additionally a relatively high proportion of the retail segment’s costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense as a result significant losses would result should the retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason 

certain of the company’s stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing corporate events and brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the company’s more typical retail stores the company has opened seven such stores through october 2005 because of their location and size these high profile stores also require the company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total 

remaining commitments per location ranging from 4 million to 46 million closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

many of the general risks and uncertainties the company faces could also have an adverse impact on its retail segment also many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond the company’s control that could adversely affect the retail segment’s future results cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected andor have an adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the retail segment include among other things macroeconomic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation failure to attract new users to the macintosh platform inability to sell thirdparty hardware and software products at adequate margins failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the us costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of applebranded and thirdparty retail inventory and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost 

investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated 

the company has and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the company’s strategic direction and product roadmap such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management’s attention away from normal business operations insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy and unidentified issues not discovered in the company’s due diligence process because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results or financial condition 

declines in the sales of the company’s professional products software accessories or service and support contracts or increases in sales of consumer products including ipods may negatively impact the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages 

the company’s professional products including power macintosh and powerbook systems software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than the company’s consumer products including imacs ibooks ipods and content from the itunes music store a shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the company’s future gross margin and operating margin percentages the company’s traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products specifically the imac g5 and ibook instead of professional products professional users may choose to buy the imac g5 due to its relative price performance use of the same powerpc g5 processor used in the company’s power macs and unique design featuring a flat panel screen potential powerbook customers may also choose to purchase ibooks instead due to their price performance and screen size additionally significant future growth in ipod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages 

it is likely that some of the company’s current and potential professional creative and small business customers who are most likely to utilize professional systems believe that the relatively slower mhz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the company utilizes in its macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance these factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the company’s professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages 

the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 

the company’s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels the company’s direct sales primarily through its retail and online stores generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales additionally the company’s direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products which generally have higher gross margins than its indirect channels as a result the company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix or new product announcements including the transition to intelbased macintosh computers in addition the company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months a pattern typical in the personal computer industry this sales pattern can produce pressure on the company’s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the company’s ability to predict its financial results accurately developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the company’s products an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company’s key logistics components suppliers or manufacturing partners can have significant adverse impacts on the company and its results of operations and financial condition 

the company has higher research and development and selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors 

the company’s ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace as a result the company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures further as a result of the expansion of the company’s retail segment and costs associated with marketing the company’s brand including its unique operating system the company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

the company distributes its products through thirdparty computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers a substantial majority of the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company also has unsecured nontrade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has entered into longterm supply agreements to secure supply of nand flashmemory and intends to prepay a total of 125 billion under these agreements while the company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses additionally if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate it becomes more likely that the company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors 

the company’s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 

much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including its chief executive officer members of its executive team and those in technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley where the majority of 

the company’s key employees are located the company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent recent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the company’s future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 

the company is subject to risks associated with the selection availability and cost of insurance 

the company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs higher policy deductibles lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions for some risks because of cost andor availability the company does not have insurance coverage because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks and in some cases self insures completely unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position 

failure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the company relies could adversely affect the company’s future operating results 

information technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the company’s ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders impeding the manufacture or shipment of products or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures however there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the company or a thirdparty vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations 

a large portion of the company’s revenue is derived from its international operations as a result the company’s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities including economic and labor conditions political instability tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased the company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to nondollar denominated sales in europe japan australia canada and certain parts of asia and nondollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world weaknesses in foreign currencies particularly the japanese yen and the euro can adversely impact consumer demand for the company’s products and the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currency denominated sales conversely a strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can cause the company to modify international pricing and affect the value of the company’s foreign denominated sales and in some cases may also increase the cost to the company of some product components 

margins on sales of the company’s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties 

derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

further information related to the company’s global market risks may be found in part ii item 7a of this form 10k under the subheading “foreign currency risk” and may be found in part ii item 8 of this form 10k at notes 1 and 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations 

production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations including in some instances the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates including various european union member countries japan and certain states within the us in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

changes in accounting rules could affect the company’s future operating results 

financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles these principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies including the fasb and the sec who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards a change from current accounting standards could have a significant effect on the company’s results of operations in december 2004 the fasb issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for sharebased payments sfas no 123r in april 2005 the sec deferred the effective date of sfas no 123r to years beginning after june 15 2005 therefore sfas no 123r will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company expects the adoption of sfas no 123r will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately 003 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 although the effect from the adoption of sfas no 123r is expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fairvalue of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stockbased compensation expense 

changes in the company’s tax rates could affect its future results 

the company’s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse affect on the company’s net income and financial condition 

the company’s stock price may be volatile 

the company’s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the company and its competitors the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors including lack of positive general economic and political conditions and investors’ concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets may materially adversely affect the market price of the company’s stock in the future in addition increases in the company’s stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate and foreign currency risk management 

the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap and option positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures however given the effective horizons of the company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates in addition the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to marktomarket instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company’s operating results and financial position 

interest rate risk 

while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries the company’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates in this regard changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

the company’s shortterm investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital meet liquidity requirements and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment the company benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio the external managers adhere to the company’s investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process 

the company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company’s investment portfolio the company places its shortterm investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and by policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the company’s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as shortterm investments as of september 24 2005 approximately 287 million of the company’s shortterm investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years as of september 25 2004 180 million of the company’s investment portfolio classified as shortterm investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years the remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities due to liquidity needs in anticipation of credit deterioration or for duration management the company recognized a net loss before taxes of 137000 in 2005 and net gains before taxes of 1 million and 21 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively as a result of such sales 

in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company’s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september 24 2005 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 199 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september 25 2004 a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a 144 million decline in fair value such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity except in instances noted above the company’s policy is to hold investments to maturity 

from time to time the company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions in order to better match the company’s floatingrate interest income on its cash equivalents and shortterm investments with its fixedrate interest expense on its debt andor to diversify a portion of the company’s exposure away from fluctuations in shortterm us interest rates the company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during 2005 or 2004 and had no open interest rate derivatives at september 24 2005 

foreign currency risk 

in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar may negatively affect the company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 

the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries generally the company’s practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures however the company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 

in order to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company’s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate 3000 random market price paths the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company’s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 100 million as of september 24 2005 compared to a maximum oneday loss of 32 million as of september 25 2004 because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 

actual future gains and losses associated with the company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september 24 2005 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company’s actual exposures and positions
