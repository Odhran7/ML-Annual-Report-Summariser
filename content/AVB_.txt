general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily apartment communities in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california as well as in our expansion markets of raleighdurham and charlotte north carolina southeast florida dallas and austin texas and denver colorado we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe historically have been characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics have offered and will continue in the future to offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics 

at january 31 2022 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

• 278 operating apartment communities containing 81803 apartment homes in 12 states and the district of columbia of which 268 communities containing 79213 apartment homes were consolidated for financial reporting purposes and 10 communities containing 2590 apartment homes were held by unconsolidated entities in which we hold an ownership interest 

• 17 whollyowned apartment communities under development that are expected to contain an aggregate of 5386 apartment homes when completed and two unconsolidated investments which each hold an apartment community under development and together are expected to contain an aggregate of 803 apartment homes when completed 

• the park loggia which contains 172 forsale residential condominiums of which 132 have been sold as of january 31 2022 and 66000 square feet of commercial space of which 87 has been leased as of january 31 2022 

• rights to develop an additional 27 communities that if developed as expected will contain 10092 apartment homes 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm shareholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv maintain a capital structure that we believe is aligned with our business risks and allows us to maintain continuous access to costeffective capital we undertake our development and redevelopment activities primarily through inhouse development and redevelopment teams which are complemented by our inhouse acquisition platform we believe that our organizational structure which includes dedicated development and operational teams and strong culture are key differentiators we pursue our development redevelopment investment and operating activities with the purpose of creating a better way to live  

our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management we operate our apartment communities under four core brands avalon ava eaves by avalon and our kanso brand which we introduced in 2020 we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint our core “avalon” brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services “ava” targets customers in high energy transitserved neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living and a variety of active common spaces that encourage socialization “eaves by avalon” is targeted to the cost conscious “value” segment primarily in suburban areas in 2020 we introduced our kanso brand through one of our current development communities the kanso brand is designed to create an apartment living experience that offers simplicity without sacrifice at a more moderate price point featuring highquality apartment homes limitedtono community amenities and a lowtouch largely selfservice operating model that leverages technology and smart access we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by appealing to different consumer preferences 

during the three years ended december 31 2021 we 

• acquired 12 apartment communities excluding unconsolidated investments and in 2019 we purchased our joint venture partners interest in one operating community obtaining a 100 ownership in that apartment community 

• disposed of 24 apartment communities excluding unconsolidated investments 

• realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of four communities owned by unconsolidated real estate entities and 

• completed the development of 24 apartment communities and the redevelopment of nine apartment communities 

a more detailed description of our unconsolidated real estate entities and the related investment activity can be found in note 5 “investments” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we maintain regional offices to identify and support development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also have regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

• bellevue washington 

• boca raton and miami florida 

• boston massachusetts 

• chapel hill north carolina 

• denver colorado 

• irvine california 

• los angeles california 

• melville new york 

• new york new york 

• san francisco california 

• san jose california 

• shelton connecticut 

• virginia beach virginia and 

• westfield new jersey 

after selecting a site for development we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire an interest in the site after the completion of entitlements and shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning when acquiring improved land with existing commercial uses prior to development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are recognized in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor commercial space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “properties” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities or in locations where we have limited historical experience such as our expansion markets where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when real estate market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity by redeploying the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other terms of each proposal 

as part of the archstone acquisition in 2013 as defined in item 1 “business” in the companys form 10k filed february 22 2019 we acquired and still own 14 assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on the contributed assets our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don’t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the archstone partnership after review and investigation of archstone’s tax and accounting records we estimate that had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2021 with respect to all 14 assets the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately 45100000 at the present time we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio while we are primarily focused on acquisitions in our expansion markets of raleighdurham and charlotte north carolina southeast florida dallas and austin texas and denver colorado we may pursue additional investments in our legacy coastal markets based on market conditions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize operating income include 

• focusing on associate engagement and resident satisfaction 

• staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are matched with seasonal demand 

• delivering high occupancy with premium pricing for various customer segments and 

• making innovations in our operating model through i leveraging technology including digital cloud and various automation technologies and ii data science to optimize revenue from the portfolio while reducing customer acquisition transaction and retention costs 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

• purchase order controls acquiring goods and services from preapproved vendors 

• national negotiated contracts and bulk purchases where possible 

• bidding thirdparty contracts on a volume basis 

• retaining residents through high levels of service which reduces apartment turnover costs marketing and vacant apartment utility costs 

• performing turnover work inhouse or hiring third parties generally considering the most cost effective approach as well as expertise needed to perform the work 

• regular preventive maintenance to maximize resident safety and satisfaction and property and equipment life 

• centralization of many community administration and support tasks at our shared service center 

• pursuing real estate tax appeals 

• installing high efficiency lighting and water fixtures cogeneration systems and solar panels and 

• implementing technology for resident and prospect services such as package lockers and self guided or virtual tours 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue expense net operating income “noi” and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities where we have limited historical experience such as our expansion markets or for other reasons 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction we provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes see “tax matters” below 

financing strategy our financing strategy is to maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to help ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1750000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would develop andor own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other activities and to make nonequity investments including the following 

• commercial space  we own and lease commercial space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for commercial eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the commercial space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of commercial space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2021 we had a total of approximately 867000 square feet of rentable commercial space excluding commercial space within communities currently under development gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in 2021 was 31885000 14 of total revenue 

• forsale real estate development  we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the commercial or forsale residential components of a mixeduse building or project that we help develop we may from time to time through a taxable reit subsidiary trs develop real estate and hold it out for sale upon completion if we believe at the outset or due to changed circumstances that this will be the best use or disposition opportunity for the property as is the case with our sale of apartment condominium units at the park loggia condominium development in new york ny 

• property technology and environmental investments  we have also invested either through a whollyowned trs or in an investment vehicle that has elected to be treated as a trs in companies and in venture funds that invest in companies that provide technology services to the real estate industry and we have invested through a trs in environmentally focused investment funds to further our sustainability efforts and learning as of december 31 2021 we invested 17277000 in various property technology and environmentally focused companies directly and indirectly through investment management funds 

• debt financing  while we generally invest in equity through fee simple ownership or an equity investment in a joint venture we may invest in mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages secured by real estate owned or being developed by an unaffiliated third party and we may act as a direct unsecured lender to an unaffiliated third party that owns or is developing real estate at december 31 2021 we had no such investments but were pursuing opportunities to make such investments 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

we conduct many of the administrative functions associated with our property operations including billing collections and response to resident inquiries through an internally operated shared services center rather than having onsite associates conduct such activities we believe this centralized platform allows our onsite associates to focus more on current and prospective resident services while at the same time enabling us to reduce costs mitigate risk and increase our availability and responsiveness to our residents we are exploring the possibility of performing these shared service center administrative functions for a third party as a means of creating an additional revenue stream and economies of scale at our center we cannot assure that we will provide such services to a third party or that it will be successful if we do so 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a reit with limited exceptions such as those described under “property management strategy” above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent such taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds reits both in the multifamily as well as other sectors and other well capitalized investors to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose pricing may be perceived as a better value given the quality location terms and amenities that the prospective resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent including those offered through online platforms although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

regulatory matters 

compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business including our capital expenditures earnings and competitive position which can be material we incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business which include among others federal securities laws and regulations applicable stock exchange requirements reit and other tax laws and regulations environmental and health and safety laws and regulations local zoning usage and other regulations relating to real property the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and related laws and regulations 

environmental regulations as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes 

regulations relating to the construction operation and leasing of our communities the construction operation and leasing of our communities is subject to federal state and local laws and regulations include zoning laws building codes requirements that our communities be accessible to persons with disabilities fair housing laws and depending on the jurisdiction regulations regarding the charging of rents and fees and increases in such amounts upon renewal of leases some laws relating to the setting of rents apply broadly such as in california where residential rent increases at renewal in communities older than fifteen years are limited to the lesser of 10 or 5 plus local consumer price index cpi and in new york where laws regulate increases on those units that are subject to rentcontrol or rentstabilization in california the governor and local governments have the ability to enact and have in recent years exercised such right for example in connection with wildfires local or statewide states of emergency which limit our ability to increase new and renewal rents to no more than 10 over the rent in place on the date such state of emergency was declared which has impacted some of our california communities in addition various temporary federal state and local laws enacted during the covid19 pandemic have imposed additional regulations of or limitations on our ability to evict tenants who are delinquent in payment of their rent charge late fees or raise rents more than a regulated amount upon renewal 

see part i item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of material risks to us including to the extent material to our competitive position relating to governmental regulations and see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations

values a commitment to integrity a spirit of caring and a focus on continuous improvement and our cultural norms we collaborate excel innovate act like owners are thoughtful and thorough and show appreciation 

at january 31 2022 we had 2927 employees of which approximately 97 were employed on a fulltime basis approximately 70 of our associates work onsite at our operating communities and the balance work on other matters none of our associates are represented by a union except for approximately 20 maintenance associates at communities in westchester county new york where we are in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement 

we consider the following aspects of human capital management to be important 

diversity and inclusion we value workforce diversity and an inclusive culture we believe that a diverse workplace will produce a variety of perspectives motivate associates and help us understand and better serve our customers and the communities in which we do business at january 31 2022 38 of our associates selfidentified as white 30 as hispanic 14 as black 6 as asian and 12 as other ethnicities two or more ethnicities or did not respond at january 31 2022 61 of our associates selfidentified as male and 39 as female we are committed to promoting and achieving greater workplace diversity and have undertaken active steps to further this goal 

associate engagement we monitor the engagement of our associates receive feedback from our associates and benchmark our performance by having a third party firm conduct anonymous associate perspective surveys each year the results are discussed and presented both on a companywide basis and within each functional group 

safety we take workplace safety seriously at our construction sites our operating communities and our offices through our construction site safety observation program and our dedicated safety team we monitor projectlevel safety performance metrics at our construction sites and elements of compensation for our construction group and our ceo are based on safety compliance performance our maintenance associates are required to take monthly safety training on a variety of subjects and our risk management group monitors incident reports from our offices and communities the covid19 pandemic has presented unique health and safety challenges and we have taken a number of actions in response to promote the wellbeing of our associates including permitting remote work and flexible schedules where feasible providing extended company paid leave for associates who needed to miss work for covid19 related reasons establishing office and community protocols for associate safety conducting training and refresher courses on covid19 prevention and communicating regularly with associates on covid19 topics

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic’s impact on multifamily rental housing 

the national and global impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the impact of new strains of the original virus continue to evolve regulatory measures have at times included varying requirements for social distancing limitations on landlords rights with respect to delinquent tenants and restrictions on travel congregation and business operations business and consumer preferences for work and living arrangements during the pandemic continue to evolve as well the longterm impact of covid19 on the economy remains uncertain the covid19 pandemic continues to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover many of the risk factors set forth in this form 10k should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic in addition if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease the company and our properties may be subject to similar risks as the risks posed by covid19 

regulatory business and consumer responses to the covid19 pandemic impact our operations 

operating impacts from the covid19 pandemic include the following 

• numerous state local and federal entities imposed restrictions for varying times and to varying degrees on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual lease obligations and this will continue to affect our ability until a restriction is lifted or expires to enforce all our remedies such as pursuing collections and seeking evictions for the failure to pay rent 

• consumers whose income has declined who are working remotely or who cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants gyms and entertainment venues may decide to live in a location other than our markets for as long as interest rates remain low and health concerns remain consumers who would otherwise rent a multifamily apartment may opt instead to rent a single family home or purchase a home demand from students and demand for corporate apartment homes have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by trends in remote learning and work and the adoption of new online technologies 

• various state local and federal rules required us in some jurisdictions or for some properties to waive late fees and certain other customary fees associated with our apartment rental business and may do so in the future we have elected at times also to waive these fees even where or when not required and may do so in the future these requirements or practices have resulted and to the extent implemented or continued may in the future result in foregone revenue 

• our properties may also incur significant costs or losses related to shelterinplace or stayathome orders quarantines infection cleanup costs or other related factors 

• social distancing and other measures have caused us from time to time to revise the manner in which we meet with prospective residents and serve current residents for example prospective residents visiting apartments may do so virtually or on a selftour rather than being accompanied by a leasing consultant in addition in many communities access to various common areas may be limited these factors may affect resident satisfaction and leasing velocity 

• there are growing concerns related to the general economy about i supply chain constraints caused by business challenges resulting from the pandemic and ii inflation caused by both supply chain constraints and governmental fiscal and monetary policies supply chain constraints could cause delays in our construction and redevelopment activity and inflation could cause our construction and operating costs to increase in the event that our rents and rental revenue do not increase sufficiently to offset increases in construction and operating costs our operating results would be negatively impacted 

in addition to renting apartment homes directly to residents we also lease ancillary commercial space at our communities and lease apartment homes to corporate apartment home providers in 2021 14 of our total revenue was from commercial tenants and 21 of our total residential revenue was from corporate apartment home providers to the extent that the pandemic or any associated government restrictions have adverse impacts on the businesses of our commercial tenants or demand from corporate apartment home providers we may experience elevated delinquencies for these tenants there may also be a greater risk of bankruptcy and default from commercial and corporate apartment home providers 

emergency orders shutting down nonessential businesses limiting congregations of people and requiring social distancing have at times disrupted and may in the future disrupt our development and construction activity to the extent we experience delays in construction our construction costs may increase and we may not achieve on the schedule we originally planned the cash flows that we expect when we begin leasing a completed property we may also delay the start of construction of additional development communities which if constructed and leased as originally planned would have been a source of future additional cash flow 

the same factors as described immediately above may also impact our workforce many associates particularly in overhead positions are working remotely this disruption in the normal operations of our workforce as well as the possibility of illness among our associates or a substantial portion of our workforce could also adversely affect our operations 

risks related to investments through acquisitions construction development and joint ventures 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may expose us to the following risks among others 

• we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities 

• occupancy rates and rents at a community may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing communities 

• we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

• we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material labor or other costs 

• we may be unable to complete construction of a community on schedule or for the originally projected cost resulting in increased construction and financing costs 

• we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process for example in connection with managing existing improvements on the site prior to tenant terminations and demolition such as commercial space or in connection with providing services to third parties such as the construction of shared infrastructure or other improvements and 

• we may incur liability if our communities are not constructed in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities acts the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in imposition of fines an award of damages to private litigants and a requirement that we undertake structural modifications to remedy the noncompliance 

refer to our “risks related to liquidity and financing” section below for additional construction and development risks related to financing 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability for new investments 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities may be exposed to the following risks 

• an acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment and 

• our estimate of the costs of operating repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate 

failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets we may be exposed to a variety of risks when we enter a new market including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities 

we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity such as the sale of the residential condominiums at the park loggia a mixeduse development located in new york new york we may be unsuccessful at developing real estate with the intent to sell or in selling condominiums at originally underwritten values or at all as a disposition strategy for an asset which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds and joint ventures and technology and environmentally focused companies 

at times we invest directly and indirectly in real estate as a partner or a coventurer with other investors or in technology and environmentally focused companies joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses or the debt and obligations of an investment that our investments may lose all or some of their value that our partner might have business goals that are inconsistent with ours which may result in the venture or investment being unable to implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests that in cases where we are the general partner or managing member our partners holding a majority of the equity interests may remove us from such role in certain cases involving cause and that we may be liable andor our status as a reit may be jeopardized if either the investments or the reit entities associated with the investments fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell or similar arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest acquire our partners interest or force a sale of the asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and on terms that are not most advantageous to us 

our investments in technology companies or in funds that invest in technology companies are generally held through taxable reit subsidiaries pursuant to which we will incur taxable gains upon the disposition of our interests in addition the value of these investments may be volatile and declines in value may impact our reported income even if we do not sell the investment 

we are exposed to risks associated with real estate assets that are subject to ground leases that may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in those assets limit our use and expose us to loss if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

we own assets that are subject to longterm ground leases these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to operate the properties in addition we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us terminated or lapse as we get closer to the lease termination dates the values of the properties could decrease if we are unable to agree upon an extension of the lease with the lessor certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations andor periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own land parcels that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “properties—other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value less the cost to dispose of a parcel changes such that it is less than the carrying basis of the parcel we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

risks related to liquidity and financing 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and 

repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or issuing equity if we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate environment or a volatile economic environment or if we dilute the interest of stockholders by issuing additional equity we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations may be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our available cash will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest on our debt for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income which limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we expect that we will generally need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock and efforts to hedge such risk could be ineffective and cause us to incur additional costs 

if interest rates increase our interest costs on variable rate debt will rise unless we have hedged the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we use interest rate derivatives to hedge and manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks for example when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates prior to debt issuance by entering into interest rate hedging contracts although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline the settlement or termination of interest rate hedging contracts may involve material charges to our earnings including net costs such as transaction fees settlement costs andor breakage costs in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing and implementing an interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be effective 

bond financing and zoning and other compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes which typically provides a more favorable interest rate for us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning or an agreement relating to property taxes in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2021 49 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may or may not expire may limit our ability to raise rents and as a consequence adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions if we fail to observe these commitments we could lose benefits such as reduced property taxes or face liabilities including liability for the benefits we received under tax exempt bonds tax credits or agreements related to property taxes 

some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the tax exempt bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we 

could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

a substantial portion of our debt is subject to prepayment penalties or premiums that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to prepay the debt prior to the earlier of i its stated maturity or ii another stated date if we elect to prepay a significant amount of outstanding debt our prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

the phaseout of libor and transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects 

in 2018 the alternative reference rate committee the aarc recommended the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities published by the federal reserve bank of new york while we expect libor to be available in substantially its current form until at least the end of june 30 2023 it is possible that libor will become unavailable prior to that point due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate the impact of this transition on the interest rates charged to the company could possibly adversely affect our financing costs including spread pricing on our credit facility and variable rate unsecured term loans the term loans and certain other floating rate debt obligations as well as our operations and cash flows additionally although sofr is the aarcs recommended replacement rate it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from libor in ways similar to sofr or in ways that would result in higher interest costs for us it is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of libors end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace libor 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by our revenue generation other liquidity needs and economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our rental revenue actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may experience barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit financial flexibility 

potential difficulties in promptly selling real estate at prices we find acceptable may limit our ability to quickly change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio in response to changes in economic regulatory or other conditions federal tax laws may also limit our ability to sell properties when desired see “risks related to our reit or tax status” section for more information on federal tax law risks 

risks related to ongoing operations of our communities 

rent control and other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations 

may include zoning laws building codes landlordtenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

we have seen a recent increase in states and municipalities implementing considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit the amount by which we can raise rents or charge nonrent fees for example in 2019 the state of california adopted statewide rent control for communities older than fifteen years limiting rent increases to the lesser of 10 or 5 plus local cpi also in 2019 the state of new york adopted new rules for rentcontrolled and rentstabilized units that revised and limited the way rent increases are calculated for renewal leases basing increases solely on rent actually paid and eliminating the ability to increase the renewal rent to a higher “registered rent” furthermore in california the governor has the ability to enact local or statewide states of emergency which limit our ability to increase new and renewal rents more than 10 over the rent in place on the date such state of emergency was declared which has impacted some of our california communities current and future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other apartment operators as well as rental housing alternatives such as singlefamily homes for rent and short term furnished offerings such as those available from extended stay hotels or through online listing services in addition our residents and prospective residents also consider as an alternative to renting the purchase of a new or existing condominium or singlefamily home competitive residential housing could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our real estate assets 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities and may be adversely affected by the following risks 

• corporate restructurings andor layoffs and industry slowdowns 

• an oversupply of or a reduced demand for apartment homes 

• a decline in household formation or employment or lack of employment growth 

• the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases and 

• economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses such as increases in property taxes utilities compensation of onsite associates and routine maintenance 

risks related to commercial operations 

although we are primarily in the multifamily rental business we also own and lease ancillary commercial space gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in our portfolio represented 14 of our total revenue in 2021 the long term nature of our commercial leases and characteristics of many of our tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates also when leases for our existing commercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our reit or tax status 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to regular federal corporate income tax on our taxable income in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our stockholders in addition we hold certain assets and engage in certain activities through our taxable reit subsidiaries that a reit could not engage in directly we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary or to engage in activities that generate nonqualifying reit income our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as regular corporations 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividend received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

we may experience regulatory and federal tax barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit financial flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders 

from time to time we dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as “likekind exchanges” under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse tax consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common stock or debt securities 

at any time the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended we cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation will be adopted promulgated or become effective and any such law regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively we and our stockholders and holders of our debt securities could be adversely affected by any such change in or any new federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation 

risks that may not be insured in full or in part 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks discussed below 

insurance coverage for various risks can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical incidents that directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including increased maintenance repair and delays in construction in addition we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations the following risks are uninsurable or insurance coverage is limited due to premium rates see item 2 “properties—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” 

• earthquake risk as further described in item 2 “properties—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply 

• climate and severe or inclement weather risk many of our markets particularly those located in coastal cities are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including those arising from climate change such as hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding 

• terrorism and other risk we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc which have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms and in amounts we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical 

we may incur costs related to climate change 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions in addition changes in federal state and local regulations based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures or operating expenses on our existing properties for example requiring retrofitting of existing systems and our new development properties for example to improve energy efficiency reduce greenhouse gas emissions andor improve resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various public health laws and regulations we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the presence or effects of hazardous or toxic substances such as asbestos lead paint chemical vapors from soils or groundwater petroleum product releases and natural substances such as methane and radon gas we may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate or contain the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities 

may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties and may subject us to liability in connection with personal injury 

certain laws and regulations govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we have acquired although we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we may fail to adequately observe such program or a disturbance of acms may occur nevertheless exposing us to liability we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties 

we cannot assure you that 

• the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities 

• no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments 

• no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared 

• the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities such as the presence of underground storage tanks will not affect the environmental condition of our communities 

• future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations will not result in the imposition of environmental liability and 

• no environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability 

general risk factors 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued this could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but it is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law restricts some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations 

the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology or any noncompliance with applicable laws with respect to the use of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

various laws and regulations and interpretations thereof as well as agreements with payment processors require or may require us to comply with rules related to our websites for use by residents and prospective residents including requirements related to accessibility of our websites to persons with disabilities and our handling and use of data we collect we could face liabilities for failure to comply with these requirements new statutes such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” and related regulations are evolving and may be subject to differing interpretations we could incur costs to comply with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the 

opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the company

 item 2 properties 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities current communities consolidated and unconsolidated communities in various stages of development development communities and unconsolidated development communities and development rights as defined below our current communities are further classified as same store communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as same store other stabilized leaseup redevelopment or unconsolidated according to the following attributes 

• same store for the year ended december 31 2021 is composed of consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the respective prior year period for the year ended december 31 2021 same store communities are consolidated for financial reporting purposes had stabilized occupancy as of january 1 2020 are not conducting or are not probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or probable for disposition to unrelated third parties within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of i attainment of 90 physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment 

• other stabilized is composed of completed consolidated communities that we own and that are not same store but which have stabilized occupancy as defined above as of january 1 2021 or which were acquired subsequent to january 1 2020 other stabilized includes stabilized operating communities in charlotte north carolina and dallas texas the two new expansion markets we entered in 2021 but excludes communities that are conducting or are probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year as defined below 

• leaseup is composed of consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and that do not have stabilized occupancy 

• redevelopment is composed of consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the current year redevelopment is considered substantial when i capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of 5000000 or 10 of the communitys preredevelopment basis and ii physical occupancy is below or is expected to be below 90 during or as a result of the redevelopment activity 

• unconsolidated is composed of communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture 

development is composed of consolidated communities that are either currently under construction or were under construction and were completed during the current year these communities may be partially or fully complete and operating 

unconsolidated development is composed of communities that are either currently under construction or were under construction and were completed during the current year in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture these communities may be partially or fully complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest where we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

as of december 31 2021 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our same store communities portfolio annually changes in the same store communities portfolios for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



 

1 we remove a community from our same store portfolio if we believe that planned activity for the upcoming year will result in that communitys expected operations not being comparable to the prior year including i when we intend to undertake a significant capital renovation such that the community will be classified as a redevelopment community ii when we intend to dispose of a community or iii when a significant casualty loss occurs 

2 community was moved from the same store portfolio to the other stabilized portfolio as a result of a casualty loss that occurred during the year and impacted operations 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings of stacked flats andor townhome apartments in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities consisting of larger elevatorserved buildings of four or more stories frequently with structured parking as of january 31 2022 our current communities consisted of the following 



as discussed in item 1 “business” we operate under four core brands avalon ava e aves by avalon and kanso  we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team that is focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal we believe our mission of creating a better way to live helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses

during 2020 we entered into a joint venture to develop own and operate ava arts district an apartment community located in los angeles ca which is currently under construction and expected to contain 475 apartment homes and 56000 square feet of commercial space when completed we own a 250 interest in the venture and contributed our total required equity investment of 30436000 the venture has secured a 167147000 variable rate construction loan to fund approximately 60 of the development of ava arts district of which 11581000 has been drawn as of december 31 2021 we have guaranteed the construction loan on behalf of the venture and any obligations under the construction loan guarantee except for obligations arising from our misconduct are required capital contributions of the partners based on ownership interest

development rights 

at december 31 2021 we had 147546000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in seven land parcels we own in addition we had 40414000 in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to i 14 development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land as well as ii costs incurred for three development rights that are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and which will be constructed on land currently adjacent to or directly associated with those operating communities for which we own the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 24 development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 8070 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any unrecoverable capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2021 we incurred a charge of 3231000 for expensed transaction development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries which include development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined were no longer probable of being developed 

you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2021 we acquired the following land parcels for an aggregate investment of 174224000 



 

1 projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date if any and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community determined in accordance with gaap including land and related acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees as well as costs incurred for first generation commercial tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions net of projected proceeds for any planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate 

2 construction on this land parcel commenced during 2021 

disposition activity 

we sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our periods of ownership and we generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a taxdeferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2021 to january 31 2022 we sold our interest in nine whollyowned operating communities containing 2404 apartment homes with an aggregate gross sales price of 867200000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities with insurance policies issued by a combination of third party insurers as well as a whollyowned captive insurance company these policies along with other insurance policies we maintain have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable we utilize a whollyowned captive insurance company to insure certain types and amounts of risks which include property damage and resulting business interruption losses general liability insurance and other construction related liability risks the captive is utilized to insure other limited levels of risk which may be in part reinsured by third party insurance there are however certain types of losses including but not limited to losses arising from nuclear liability pandemic or acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under part i item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or casualty loss 

our communities are insured for certain property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor a master property insurance program which covers the majority of our communities this master property program provides a 400000000 limit for any single occurrence and annually in the aggregate subject to certain sublimits and exclusions under the master property program we are subject to various deductibles per occurrence as well as additional selfinsured retentions in addition to our potential liability for the various policy selfinsured retentions and deductibles our captive insurance company is directly responsible for 100 of the first 25000000 of losses per occurrence and 10 of the second 25000000 of losses per occurrence incurred by the master property insurance policy our master property insurance program includes coverage for losses resulting from customary perils including but not limited to wildfires and windstorms limits deductibles selfinsured retentions and coverages may increase or decrease annually during the insurance renewal process which occurs on different dates throughout the calendar year 

many of our west coast communities are located within the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault the hayward fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels we procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with a loss limit of 175000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes however for any losses resulting from earthquakes at communities located in california or washington the loss limit is 200000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate 

our southeast florida communities are in wind exposed locations that could be impacted by significant storm events like hurricanes we include coverage for losses arising from these types of weather events within our master property insurance program 

our communities are insured for thirdparty liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance program the master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions after applicable selfinsured retentions borne by us our captive insurance company is directly responsible for the first 2000000 of losses per occurrence covered by the master general liability insurance policy 

we also maintain certain casualty policies general liability umbrellaexcess and workers compensation for construction related risks that have various exclusions and deductibles that in management’s view are commercially reasonable 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings apartment communities could become targets of terrorism our communities are insured for terrorism related losses through the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” program this coverage extends to most of our casualty exposures subject to deductibles and insured limits and certain property insurance policies we have also purchased privatemarket insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of 600000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under part i item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also maintain other insurance programs that provide coverage for events including but not limited to employee dishonesty loss of data and liability associated with management of certain employee benefit plans these policies are subject to maximum loss limits and include coverage limitations or exclusion that may preclude us from fully recovering 

the amount or types of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover all losses and we may change our policy limits coverages and selfinsured retentions at any time 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is involved in various claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business while no assurances can be given the company does not currently believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

2021 financial highlights 

net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2021 was 1004299000 an increase of 176669000 or 213 over the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains as well as increased noi in the current year from development and newly acquired communities these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in noi from same store and communities sold in 2020 and 2021 and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year 

same store noi attributable to our apartment rental operations including parking and other ancillary residential revenue residential for the year ended december 31 2021 was 1370282000 a decrease of 66283000 or 46 from the prior year the decrease was due to a decrease in rental revenue of 45643000 or 22 as well as an increase in property operating expenses of 20300000 or 32 over 2020 

during 2021 we raised approximately 2138184000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes sale of common shares under our fifth continuous equity program cep v and the sale of nine consolidated operating communities condominiums at the park loggia and other real estate this amount does not include our share of proceeds from joint venture dispositions we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2021 we 

• completed the construction of nine consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 2752 apartment homes and 29000 square feet of commercial space for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 1070000000 

• started the construction of 10 consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 3010 apartment homes which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 1246000000 

we also achieved portfolio growth through acquisitions acquiring seven consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 1932 apartment homes and 90000 square feet of commercial space for an aggregate purchase price of 724500000 

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources existing cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

covid19 pandemic 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we adjusted our business operations to address the safety of and financial impacts on our residents and associates including in certain jurisdictions i providing flexible lease renewal options ii creating payment plans for residents who are impacted by covid19 and iii waiving late fees and certain other customary fees associated with apartment rentals to the extent still implemented we may discontinue these measures at any time except where required by law 

the impact on our consolidated results of operations from covid19 for future periods will depend among other factors on i the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government to address covid19 and any variants and relieve the economic distress of consumers such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent and ii the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our collections and associated outstanding receivables with the impact partially mitigated by payments received under government rent relief programs the following table presents for our 2021 same store communities for the periods presented the percentages of the following charges to residents that we have collected including i apartment base rent and ii other rentable items such as parking and storage rent along with pet and other recurring fees in accordance with residential leases collectively collected residential revenue which excludes transactional fees included in collections are 28286000 of aggregate rent relief payments received for our same store portfolio during the year ended december 31 2021

the collection rates are based on resident activity as reflected in our property management systems and are presented to provide information about collections trends during the covid19 pandemic prior to the covid19 pandemic the collections information provided was not routinely produced for internal use by senior management or publicly disclosed by the company and is a result of analysis that is not subject to internal controls over financial reporting this information is not prepared in accordance with gaap does not reflect gaap revenue or cash flow metrics and may be subject to adjustment in preparing gaap revenue and cash flow metrics additionally this information should not be interpreted as predicting the company’s financial performance results of operations or liquidity for any period as of december 31 2021 and 2020 t he outstanding rent receivable balance for residential and commercial tenants net of reserves was 18594000 and 18159000 respectively 

communities overview 

as of december 31 2021 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 297 apartment communities containing 87992 apartment homes in 12 states and the district of columbia of which 17 consolidated communities were under development and one community was under redevelopment we have an indirect interest in 12 of the 297 apartment communities which were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including two that are being developed within joint ventures in addition we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 24 communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 8070 apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current communities development communities unconsolidated development communities and development rights our current communities are further classified as same store 

communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities 

same store communities are consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years other stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy at the beginning of the current year or were acquired during the year leaseup communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and does not have stabilized occupancy redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the fiscal year unconsolidated communities are communities in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated entity a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of same store communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in same store noi noi derived from acquisitions development completions and development under construction and in leaseup loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity in addition as discussed above under “executive overview  covid19 pandemic” and elsewhere in this report the covid19 pandemic continues to affect our business and may continue to do so see also part i item 1a “risk factors” discussion of our operating results for 2020 and comparison to 2019 can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the companys form 10k filed with the sec on february 25 2021 a comparison of our operating results for 2021 and 2020 follows dollars in thousands 



 

1 percent change is not meaningful 

net income attributable to common stockholders increased 176669000 or 213 to 1004299000 in 2021 over 2020 primarily due to an increase in gains on consolidated and unconsolidated real estate dispositions in the current year partially offset by a decrease in same store noi and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year 

noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses expensed transaction development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries interest expense net loss on extinguishment of debt net general and administrative expense income from investments in unconsolidated entities depreciation expense income tax expense benefit casualty and impairment loss gain on sale of communities gain on other real estate transactions net net forsale condominium activity and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs residential noi represents results attributable to the companys apartment rental operations including parking and other ancillary residential revenue reconciliations of noi and residential noi for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



 

1 represents results attributable to the nonapartment components of our mixeduse communities and other nonresidential operations commercial 

the residential noi changes for 2021 as compared to 2020 consists of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



the decrease in our residential same store noi in 2021 is due to a decrease in rental revenue of 45643000 or 22 and an increase in property operating expenses of 20300000 or 32 over 2020 

rental and other income decreased 5676000 or 02 in 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased rental rates amortization of concessions at our same store communities and decreased rental income from dispositions partially offset by additional rental income generated from development completions and development under construction and in leaseup and acquisitions increased occupancy at our same store communities and a decrease in commercial uncollectible lease revenue 

as discussed elsewhere in this report the covid19 pandemic and direct and indirect related economic regulatory and operating impacts are likely to continue to adversely affect our rental revenue deteriorating financial conditions among our residents and commercial tenants as well as regulations that limit our ability to evict residents and tenants may continue to result in higher than normal uncollectible lease revenue the pandemic may also continue to depress demand among consumers for our apartments for a variety of other reasons including i if consumers decide to live in markets that are less costly than ours for one or more reasons such as a decline in their income remote working arrangements or if they cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants gyms and entertainment venues ii that consumers who would otherwise rent may seek home ownership and iii ongoing downward pressures on demand for certain types of housing eg corporate apartment homes or by certain consumers eg students or consumers who require seasonal jobrelated demand such as in the entertainment industry 

consolidated communities—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 75744 apartment homes for 2021 as compared to 73724 homes for 2020 the weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to 2518 for 2021 as compared to 2593 in 2020

reconciliation of ffo and core ffo 

consistent with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts® “nareit” we calculate funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ffo as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap adjusted for 

• gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities 

• cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

• impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets 

• writedowns of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates 

• depreciation of real estate assets and 

• similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures including those from a change in control 

ffo and ffo adjusted for noncore items or “core ffo” as defined below are generally considered by management to be appropriate supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance in calculating ffo we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help with the comparison of the operating and financial performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies by further adjusting for items that are not considered by us to be part of our core business operations core ffo can help with the comparison of the core operating performance of the company year over year we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo and core ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report 

we calculate core ffo as ffo adjusted for 

• joint venture gains if not adjusted through ffo noncore costs and promoted interests from partnerships 

• casualty and impairment losses or gains net on nondepreciable real estate 

• gains or losses from early extinguishment of consolidated borrowings 

• development pursuit writeoffs and expensed transaction costs net of recoveries 

• thirdparty business interruption insurance proceeds and the related lost noi that is covered by the expected third party business interruption insurance proceeds 

• property and casualty insurance proceeds and legal settlement activity 

• gains or losses on sales of assets not subject to depreciation and other investment gains or losses 

• advocacy contributions representing payments to promote our business interests 

• hedge ineffectiveness or gains or losses from derivatives not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 

• severance related costs 

• executive transition compensation costs 

• net forsale condominium activity including gains marketing operating and administrative costs and imputed carry cost 

• income taxes and 

• other noncore items 

ffo and core ffo do not represent net income in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income which remains the primary measure as an indication of our performance in addition ffo and core ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to our calculations of ffo and core ffo 

ffo and core ffo also do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a presentation of gaapbased cash flow metrics is included in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

the following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to ffo attributable to common stockholders and to core ffo attributable to common stockholders for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 dollars in thousands except per share data 



 

1 amount for 2021 includes unrealized gains on property technology investments of 15908 partially offset by the writeoff of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of the final two ac jv communities 

2 amount for 2020 includes the writeoff of 7264 related to a development right in new york city 

3 the aggregate impact of i gain on forsale condominiums and ii forsale condominium marketing operating and administrative costs is a net expense of 977 for 2021 and a net gain of 2551 for 2020 

4 represents the imputed carry cost of forsale residential condominiums at the park loggia we computed this adjustment by multiplying the total capitalized cost of completed and unsold forsale residential condominiums by our weighted average unsecured debt rate 

5 amount for 2021 relates to activity generated in our trs and is comprised primarily of tax expense for condominium sales at the park loggia and other ancillary real estate amount for 2020 relates to tax losses as well as provisions of the cares act 

liquidity and capital resources 

we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management when we source capital we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility our principal focus on nearterm and intermediateterm liquidity is to ensure we have adequate capital to fund 

• development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged or in which we plan to engage 

• the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 

• debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity 

• normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses and 

• investment in our operating platform including strategic investments 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions cash flows from operations are determined by operating activities and factors including but not limited to i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels iv uncollectible lease revenue levels or interruptions in collections caused by market conditions and v operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage is affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital our plans for development redevelopment nonroutine capital expenditure acquisition and disposition activity are affected by market conditions and capital availability we frequently review our liquidity needs especially in periods with volatile market conditions as well as the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we had cash cash equivalents and cash in escrow of 543788000 at december 31 2021 an increase of 230256000 from 313532000 at december 31 2020 the following discussion relates to changes in cash cash equivalents and cash in escrow due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 1203170000 in 2021 from 1219615000 in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in noi 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities totaled 624053000 in 2021 the net cash used was primarily due to 

• acquisition of seven operating communities for 771692000 

• investment of 654861000 in the development and redevelopment of communities and 

• capital expenditures of 153235000 for our operating communities and nonreal estate assets 

these amounts were partially offset by 

• net proceeds from the disposition of nine operating communities and ancillary real estate of 850230000 and 

• net proceeds from the sale of forsale residential condominiums of 124532000 

financing activities—net cash used in financing activities totaled 348861000 in 2021 the net cash used was primarily due to 

• payment of cash dividends in the amount of 888344000 

• repayment of unsecured notes in the amount of 462147000 and 

• mortgage notes repayments and principal amortization payments in the amount of 109562000 

these amounts were partially offset by 

• proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of 1098643000 and 

• the issuance of common stock in the amount of 31874000 primarily through cep v 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we have a 1750000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the “credit facility” which matures in february 2024 the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on i the london interbank offered rate “libor” applicable to the period of borrowing for a particular draw of funds from the facility eg one month to maturity three months to maturity etc and ii the rating levels issued for our unsecured notes the current stated pricing for drawn borrowings is libor plus 0775 per annum 088 at january 31 2022 assuming a one month borrowing rate the annual facility fee for the credit facility remained at 0125 resulting in a fee of 2188000 annually based on the 1750000000 facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 6969000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2022 in addition we had 39581000 outstanding in additional letters of credit unrelated to the credit facility as of january 31 2022 

the phaseout of libor and expected transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects on our libor borrowings see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial covenants contained in the credit facility term loans and the indentures under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

• limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure 

• limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by propertyspecific financing and 

• minimum levels of debt service coverage 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2021 

in addition some of our secured borrowings include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in may 2019 we commenced cep v under which we may sell andor enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of up to 1000000000 of our common stock from time to time actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and our determinations of the appropriate funding sources we engaged sales agents for cep v who receive compensation of up to 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold we expect that if entered into we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement and to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the forward sale price however we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement in connection with each forward sale agreement we will pay the forward seller in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price a commission of up to 15 of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold during 2021 and through january 31 2022 we sold 122343 shares of common stock at an average sales price of 22615 per share for net proceeds of 27253000 under this program in addition at december 31 2021 we were party to a forward contract under cep v to sell 68577 shares of common stock for approximate proceeds of 16000000 net of offering fees and discounts based on the initial forward price with settlement of the forward contract to occur on one or more dates not later than december 31 2022 the final proceeds will be determined on the dates of settlement after adjustments for our dividends and a daily interest factor as of january 31 2022 we had 705961000 remaining authorized for issuance under this program after consideration of the forward contract 

forward interest rate swap agreements 

the following derivative activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2021 

• we terminated 150000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements for which hedge accounting was ceased in 2020 receiving a payment of 6962000 we recognized 2894000 of these proceeds as a gain in 2020 and 2654000 of these proceeds as a gain during the year ended december 31 2021 included in interest expense net on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

• in conjunction with the issuance of our 700000000 205 unsecured notes due 2032 in september 2021 we settled 200000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2021 designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes making a net payment of 2211000 we have deferred these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are recognizing the impact as a component of interest expense net over the term of the respective hedged debt 

• we entered into an additional 150000000 of new forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2022 

at the maturity of the remaining outstanding swap agreements we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value assuming that we issue the debt as expected the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment 

stock repurchase program 

in july 2020 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of 500000000 the 2020 stock repurchase program purchases of common stock under the 2020 stock repurchase program may be exercised at our discretion with the timing and number of shares repurchased depending on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities the 2020 stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice during 2021 and through january 31 2022 we had no repurchases of shares under this program as of january 31 2022 we had 316148000 remaining authorized for purchase under this program 

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities and material obligations 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that capital from additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory especially in light of the uncertain impacts of the covid19 pandemic on capital markets 

the following debt activity occurred during 2021 

• in january 2021 we repaid 27795000 principal amount of 537 fixed rate secured debt at par in advance of the april 2021 maturity date 

• in september 2021 we repaid 450000000 principal amount of our 295 unsecured notes in advance of the september 2022 scheduled maturity recognizing a loss on debt extinguishment of 17890000 composed of a prepayment penalty of 12147000 and the noncash write off of unamortized deferred hedging losses and unamortized deferred financing costs of 5743000 

• in september 2021 we issued 700000000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately 694617000 before 

considering the impact of other offering costs the notes mature in january 2032 and were issued at a 205 interest rate the notes were issued under our green bond framework and we have allocated or will allocate the net proceeds in whole or in part to one or more new or existing eligible green projects 

• in november 2021 we repaid an aggregate of 73060000 principal amount of fixed rate secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 379 at par in advance of the november 2036 maturity date 

• in november 2021 we issued 400000000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately 396976000 before considering the impact of other offering costs the notes mature in december 2028 and were issued at a 190 interest rate the notes were issued under our green bond framework and we have allocated or will allocate the net proceeds in whole or in part to one or more new or existing eligible green projects 

the following table details our consolidated debt obligations including the effective interest rate and contractual maturity dates and principal payments for periodic amortization and maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2021 and 2020 dollars in thousands we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest

3 during 2021 we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date 

4 financed by variable rate debt but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement 

in addition to consolidated debt we have scheduled contractual obligations associated with i ground leases for land underlying current operating or development communities and commercial and parking facilities and ii office leases for our corporate headquarters and regional offices of 14879000 for 2022 14642000 for 2023 and 372346000 thereafter 

future financing and capital needs—portfolio and capital markets activity 

in 2022 we expect to meet our liquidity needs from one or more of a variety of internal and external sources which may include i real estate dispositions ii cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities iii borrowing capacity under our credit facility and iv secured and unsecured debt financings additional sources of liquidity in 2022 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects 

before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity in 2022 including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures we plan to source sufficient capital to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities and new markets where our partners bring development and operational expertise andor experience to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in addition we may invest through mezzanine loans or other preferred equity investments in multifamily development projects being undertaken by third parties in these cases we do not expect to acquire the underlying real estate but rather to earn a return on our investment through interest or fixed rate preferred equity returns and a return of the invested capital generally following completion of construction either on or before a set due date as of january 31 2022 we have not made any such investments but are pursuing opportunities 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenuegenerating assets that we develop redevelop or acquire the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

risks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include those related to the covid19 pandemic including among other factors i the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government including measures to relieve economic distress such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent and ii the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic in addition the effects of the pandemic are likely to heighten the following risks which we routinely face in our business 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

• we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals 

• we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable increases in costs of development increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability resulting in losses 

• construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates 

• we may not complete construction and leaseup of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues 

• the timing and net proceeds of condominium sales may not equal our current expectations 

• occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control 

• financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities 

• the impact of new landlordtenant laws and rent regulations may be greater than we expect 

• our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

• we may be unsuccessful in our management of joint ventures and the reit vehicles that are used with certain joint ventures 

• laws and regulations implementing rent control or rent stabilization or otherwise limiting our ability to increase rents charge fees or evict tenants may impact our revenue or increase our costs 

• our expectations estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding outstanding legal proceedings are subject to change and 

• the possibility that we may choose to pay dividends in our stock instead of cash which may result in stockholders having to pay taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if any 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 46263000 and 45268000 for 2021 and 2020 respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate as of december 31 2021 capitalized pursuit costs associated with development rights totaled 40414000 

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our direct and indirect investments in real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

the assessment of impairment can involve subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset estimates of the undiscounted cash flows are sensitive to significant assumptions including future rental revenues operating expenses and our intent and ability to hold the related asset which could be impacted by our expectations about the future 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes during 2021 we terminated 150000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements for which hedge accounting was ceased in 2020 and settled 200000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with our september 2021 unsecured note issuance that had been entered into during 2021 during 2021 we entered into an additional 150000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2022 

in addition we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 714150000 and 720850000 respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2021 and 2020 our annual interest incurred would have increased by approximately 7716000 and 8289000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 8170431000 at december 31 2021 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 8565339000 at december 31 2021 contractual fixed rate debt represented 7924162000 of the fair value at december 31 2021 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2021 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 936938000

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily communities in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california as well as in our expansion markets in southeast florida and denver colorado the expansion markets we focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe historically have been characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics have offered and will continue in the future to offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics 

at january 31 2021 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

• 272 operating apartment communities containing 79856 apartment homes in 11 states and the district of columbia of which 260 communities containing 76737 apartment homes were consolidated for financial reporting purposes and 12 communities containing 3119 apartment homes were held by unconsolidated entities in which we hold an ownership interest 

• 16 whollyowned apartment communities under development that are expected to contain an aggregate of 5128 apartment homes when completed and two unconsolidated investments which each hold an apartment community under development and together are expected to contain an aggregate of 803 apartment homes when completed 

• the park loggia which contains 172 forsale residential condominiums of which 73 have been sold as of january 31 2021 and 66000 square feet of commercial space of which 69 has been leased as of january 31 2021 

• rights to develop an additional 24 communities that if developed as expected will contain 7853 apartment homes 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

table of contents 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm shareholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv maintain a capital structure that we believe is aligned with our business risks and allows us to maintain continuous access to costeffective capital we pursue our development redevelopment investment and operating activities with the purpose of creating a better way to live  our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management as described in item 2 communities we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava and eaves by avalon and in 2020 we introduced our kanso brand we pursue our development and redevelopment activities primarily through inhouse development and redevelopment teams which are complemented by our inhouse acquisition platform we believe that our organizational structure which includes dedicated development and operational teams in each of our regions and strong culture are key differentiators providing us with highly talented dedicated and capable associates 

during the three years ended december 31 2020 we 

• acquired nine apartment communities excluding unconsolidated investments and in 2019 we purchased our joint venture partners interest in one operating community obtaining a 100 ownership in that apartment community 

• disposed of 23 apartment communities excluding unconsolidated investments and the five whollyowned communities located in new york city that we contributed to a newly formed joint venture the nyc joint venture in 2018 retaining a 200 interest in the venture 

• realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of four communities owned by unconsolidated real estate entities 

• completed the development of 22 apartment communities and the redevelopment of 17 apartment communities 

a more detailed description of our unconsolidated real estate entities and the related investment activity can be found in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we maintain regional offices to identify and support development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also have regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

• bellevue washington

table of contents 

after selecting a site for development we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire an interest in the site after the completion of entitlements and shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities or in locations where we have limited historical experience where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor commercial space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when real estate market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity by redeploying the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other terms of each proposal 

table of contents 

as part of the archstone acquisition in 2013 as defined in item 1 “business” in the companys form 10k filed february 22 2019 we acquired and still own 14 assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on the contributed assets our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don’t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the archstone partnership after review and investigation of archstone’s tax and accounting records we estimate that had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2020 with respect to all 14 assets the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately 47500000 at the present time we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income “noi” 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize noi include 

• focusing on resident satisfaction 

• staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are better matched to traffic patterns 

• balancing high occupancy with premium pricing and increasing rents as market conditions and local law permit and 

• leveraging technology and data science through revenue management software to optimize the pricing and term of leases implementation of self guided tours and other innovations 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

• purchase order controls acquiring goods and services from preapproved vendors 

• national negotiated contracts and bulk purchases where possible 

• bidding thirdparty contracts on a volume basis 

• retaining residents through high levels of service which reduces apartment turnover costs marketing and vacant apartment utility costs 

• performing turnover work inhouse or hiring third parties generally considering the most cost effective approach as well as expertise needed to perform the work 

• regular preventive maintenance to maximize resident safety and satisfaction and property and equipment life 

• centralization of many community administration and support tasks at our shared service center 

• pursuing real estate tax appeals 

• installing high efficiency lighting and water fixtures cogeneration systems and sustainability initiatives such as solar in our operating platform and 

• implementing technology for resident and prospect services such as package lockers and self guided or virtual tours 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue expense noi and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

table of contents 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities where we have limited historical experience or for other reasons 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction we provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes see “tax matters” below 

financing strategy our financing strategy is to maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to help ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1750000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would develop andor own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease commercial space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for commercial eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the commercial space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of commercial space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2020 we had a total of approximately 768000 square feet of rentable commercial space excluding commercial space within communities currently under development gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in 2020 was 20434000 09 of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the commercial or forsale residential components of a mixeduse building or project that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale or if we determine that the best disposition opportunity for a development is a sale upon completion in whole or through individual apartment home condominium sales such as our park loggia condominium development any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we conduct many of the administrative functions associated with our property operations including billing collections and response to resident inquiries through an internally operated shared services center rather than having onsite associates conduct such activities we believe this centralized platform allows our onsite associates to focus more on current and prospective resident services while at the same time enabling us to reduce costs mitigate risk and increase our availability and responsiveness to our residents we are exploring the possibility of performing these shared service center administrative functions for a third party as a means of creating an additional revenue stream and economies of scale at our center we cannot assure that we will provide such services to a third party or that it will be successful if we do so 

table of contents 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a reit with limited exceptions such as those described under “property management strategy” above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent such taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds reits both in the multifamily as well as other sectors and other well capitalized investors to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose pricing may be perceived as a better value given the quality location terms and amenities that the prospective resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent including those offered through online platforms although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes 

human capital 

attracting motivating developing and retaining talented associates who share our purpose core values and cultural norms is important to our longterm success we train our associates to understand our purpose  creating a better way to live  our core values a commitment to integrity a spirit of caring and a focus on continuous improvement and our cultural norms we collaborate excel innovate act like owners are thoughtful and thorough and show appreciation 

at january 31 2021 we had 3090 employees of which approximately 96 were employed on a fulltime basis approximately 71 of our associates work onsite at our operating communities and the balance work on other matters none of our associates are represented by a union except for approximately 25 maintenance associates at communities in westchester county new york where we are in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents 

we consider the following aspects of human capital management to be important

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic’s impact on multifamily rental housing 

the national and global impacts of the covid19 pandemic continue to evolve regulatory measures taken to date to limit the impact and spread of covid19 have at times included varying requirements for social distancing limitations on landlords rights with respect to delinquent tenants and restrictions on travel congregation and business operations business and consumer preferences for work and living arrangements during the pandemic continue to evolve as well these developments along with the resulting negative employment and economic impacts have adversely affected the company as described in this report the longterm impact of covid19 on the united states and world economies remains uncertain and the duration scope and significance of any resulting economic downturn cannot currently be predicted the covid19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover many of the risk factors set forth in this form 10k should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic in addition if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease the company and our properties may be subject to similar risks as the risks posed by covid19 

regulatory business and consumer responses to the covid19 pandemic impact our operations 

operating impacts from the covid19 pandemic include the following 

• the spread of the covid19 virus and related government actions and consumer responses could result in further increases in unemployment and residents who experience deteriorating financial conditions as a result of the pandemic may be unwilling or unable to pay rent in full on a timely basis in some cases we have and may continue to restructure tenants’ rent obligations and may not be able to do so on terms as favorable to us as the lease terms that are currently in place in response to the covid19 pandemic numerous state local and federal efforts have also imposed restrictions for varying times and to varying degrees on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual lease obligations and this will affect our ability until a restriction is lifted or expires to collect rent or enforce all our remedies such as pursuing collections and seeking evictions for the failure to pay rent in addition to these regulatory limits on evictions in practical terms many of the housing courts and sheriff’s offices on which we rely to enforce our rights are not operating at the same level of volume or effectiveness as before the pandemic 

• our occupancy levels and pricing across our portfolio have declined and may continue to decline due to changes in demand consumers whose income has declined who are working remotely or who cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants gyms and entertainment venues may decide during the pandemic to live in a location other than our markets low interest rates that are caused by the pandemic and government responses as well as general health concerns may encourage consumers who would otherwise rent a multifamily apartment to rent instead a single family home or purchase a home additionally to the extent that some institutions of higher learning continue to turn to online education and business activity and travel remain at lower levels we expect that demand from students and corporate apartment homes will continue below prepandemic levels 

• various state local and federal rules have required us in some jurisdictions or for some properties to waive late fees and certain other customary fees associated with our apartment rental business and may do so in the future we have elected at times also to waive these fees even where or when not required and may do so in the future these requirements or practices have resulted and to the extent implemented or continued may in the future result in foregone revenue 

• our properties may also incur significant costs or losses related to shelterinplace or stayathome orders quarantines infection cleanup costs or other related factors 

• social distancing and other measures in response to the pandemic have caused us to revise the manner in which we meet with prospective residents and serve current residents for example many prospective residents are visiting apartments virtually or on a selftour rather than being accompanied by a leasing consultant in addition in many communities various common area amenities are closed or their access is limited these factors may affect resident satisfaction and leasing velocity 

table of contents 

in addition to renting apartment homes directly to residents we also lease ancillary commercial space at our communities and lease apartment homes to corporate apartment home providers in 2020 09 of our total revenue was from commercial tenants and 25 of our total residential revenue was from corporate apartment home providers we are experiencing a higher rate of delinquency from commercial and corporate apartment home tenants than from residential tenants there may also be a greater risk of bankruptcy and default from commercial and corporate apartment home providers 

until such time as vaccines that have been developed are widely distributed or the virus is otherwise contained or eradicated commerce and employment may not return to more customary levels and we may experience material reductions in our operating revenue and noi compared to our prepandemic experience 

emergency orders shutting down nonessential businesses limiting congregations of people and requiring social distancing have at times disrupted and may in the future disrupt our development and construction activity to the extent we experience further cessations or delays in construction our construction costs may increase and we may not achieve on the schedule we originally planned the cash flows that we expect when we begin leasing a completed property we may also delay the start of construction of additional development communities which if constructed and leased as originally planned would have been a source of future additional cash flow 

the same factors as described immediately above may also impact our workforce many associates particularly in overhead positions are working remotely this disruption in the normal operations of our workforce as well as the possibility of illness among our associates or a substantial portion of our workforce could also adversely affect our operations 

changes in available financing or investor demand for apartment communities as a result of the covid19 pandemic could impact our liquidity 

as a result of the current economic downturn the real estate market may be unable to attract the same level of capital investment that it attracted before the covid19 pandemic and there may be a reduction in the number of companies seeking to acquire properties which may result in the value of our properties not appreciating or decreasing significantly below the amount for which we acquired or developed them this may also limit our ability to promptly sell our properties if desired realize a cash return on our investment and reinvest the sales proceeds in new properties 

in light of the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic bank lending capital and other financial markets and sources may deteriorate and our access to capital and other sources of funding may become constrained which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings renewals or refinancings a constriction on lending by financial institutions could reduce the number of properties we can develop redevelop or acquire our cash flow from operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders 

risks related to investments through acquisitions construction development and joint ventures 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may expose us to the following risks among others 

• we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities 

• occupancy rates and rents at a community may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing communities 

• we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities 

• we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material labor or other costs 

• we may be unable to complete construction of a community on schedule or for the originally projected cost resulting in increased construction and financing costs 

• we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process for example in connection with managing existing improvements on the site prior to tenant terminations and demolition such as commercial space or in connection with providing services to third parties such as the construction of shared infrastructure or other improvements and 

table of contents 

• we may incur liability if our communities are not constructed in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities acts the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in imposition of fines an award of damages to private litigants and a requirement that we undertake structural modifications to remedy the noncompliance 

refer to our “risks related to liquidity and financing” section below for additional construction and development risks related to financing 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability for new investments 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities may be exposed to the following risks 

• an acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment and 

• our estimate of the costs of operating repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate 

failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets we may be exposed to a variety of risks when we enter a new market including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities 

we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity such as the sale of the residential condominiums at the park loggia a mixeduse development located in new york new york we may be unsuccessful at developing real estate with the intent to sell or in selling condominiums at originally underwritten values or at all as a disposition strategy for an asset which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds and joint ventures  

at times we invest in real estate as a partner or a coventurer with other investors joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses or the debt and obligations of a venture that our partner might have business goals that are inconsistent with ours which may result in the venture being unable to implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests that our partners holding a majority of the equity interests may remove us as the general partner or managing member in certain cases involving cause and we may be liable andor our status as a reit may be jeopardized if either the ventures or the reit entities associated with the ventures fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell or similar arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest acquire our partners interest or force a sale of the asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and on terms that are not most advantageous to us 

we are exposed to risks associated with real estate assets that are subject to ground leases that may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in those assets limit our use and expose us to loss if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

table of contents 

we own assets which are subject to longterm ground leases these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to operate the properties in addition we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us terminated or lapse as we get closer to the lease termination dates the values of the properties could decrease if we are unable to agree upon an extension of the lease with the lessor certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations andor periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own land parcels that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “communities—other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value less the cost to dispose of a parcel changes such that it is less than the carrying basis of the parcel we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

risks related to liquidity and financing 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or issuing equity if we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate environment or a volatile economic environment or if we dilute the interest of stockholders by issuing additional equity we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations may be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our available cash will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest on our debt for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income which limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we expect that we will generally need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock and efforts to hedge such risk could be ineffective and cause us to incur costs 

if interest rates increase our interest costs on variable rate debt will rise unless we have hedged the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we use interest rate derivatives to hedge and manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks for example when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates prior to debt issuance by entering into interest rate hedging contracts although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline the settlement or termination of interest rate hedging contracts may involve material charges to our earnings including net costs such as transaction fees settlement costs andor breakage costs in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing and implementing an interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be effective 

table of contents 

bond financing and zoning and other compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes which typically provides a more favorable interest rate for us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning or an agreement relating to property taxes in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2020 51 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may or may not expire may limit our ability to raise rents and as a consequence adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions if we fail to observe these commitments we could lose benefits such as reduced property taxes or face liabilities including liability for the benefits we received under tax exempt bonds tax credits or agreements related to property taxes 

some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the tax exempt bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

a substantial portion of our debt is subject to prepayment penalties or premiums that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to prepay the debt prior to the earlier of i its stated maturity or ii another stated date if we elect to prepay a significant amount of outstanding debt our prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

the phaseout of libor and transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects 

in 2018 the alternative reference rate committee identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities published by the federal reserve bank of new york by the end of 2021 it is expected that no new contracts will reference libor and will instead use sofr due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate the impact of this transition on the interest rates charged to the company could possibly adversely affect our financing costs including spread pricing on our credit facility and variable rate unsecured term loans  the term loans and certain other floating rate debt obligations as well as our operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

table of contents 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by our revenue generation other liquidity needs and economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our rental revenue actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may experience barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit financial flexibility 

potential difficulties in promptly selling real estate at prices we find acceptable may limit our ability to quickly change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio in response to changes in economic regulatory or other conditions federal tax laws may also limit our ability to sell properties when desired see “risks related to our reit or tax status” section for more information on federal tax law risks 

risks related to ongoing operations of our communities 

rent control and other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlordtenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

we have seen a recent increase in states and municipalities implementing considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit the amount by which we can raise rents or charge nonrent fees for example in 2019 the state of california adopted statewide rent control for communities older than fifteen years limiting rent increases to the lesser of 10 or 5 plus local cpi also in 2019 the state of new york adopted new rules for rentcontrolled and rentstabilized units that revised and limited the way rent increases are calculated for renewal leases basing increases solely on rent actually paid and eliminating the ability to increase the renewal rent to a higher “registered rent” furthermore in california the governor has the ability to enact local or statewide states of emergency which limit our ability to increase new and renewal rents more than 10 over the rent in place on the date such state of emergency was declared which has impacted some of our california communities current and future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other apartment operators as well as rental housing alternatives such as singlefamily homes for rent and short term furnished offerings such as those available from extended stay hotels or through online listing services in addition our residents and prospective residents also consider as an alternative to renting the purchase of a new or existing condominium or singlefamily home for sale competitive residential housing could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our real estate assets 

table of contents 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities and may be adversely affected by the following risks 

• corporate restructurings andor layoffs and industry slowdowns 

• an oversupply of or a reduced demand for apartment homes 

• a decline in household formation or employment or lack of employment growth 

• the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases and 

• economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses such as increases in property taxes utilities compensation of onsite associates and routine maintenance 

risks related to commercial operations 

although we are primarily in the multifamily rental business we also own and lease ancillary commercial space gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in our portfolio represented 09 of our total revenue in 2020 the long term nature of our commercial leases and characteristics of many of our tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates also when leases for our existing commercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our reit or tax status 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to regular federal corporate income tax on our taxable income in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our stockholders in addition we hold certain assets and engage in certain activities through our taxable reit subsidiaries that a reit could not engage in directly we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary or to engage in activities that generate nonqualifying reit income our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as regular corporations 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

table of contents 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividend received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

we may experience regulatory and federal tax barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit financial flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders 

from time to time we dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as “likekind exchanges” under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse tax consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common stock or debt securities 

at any time the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended we cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation will be adopted promulgated or become effective and any such law regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively we and our stockholders and holders of our debt securities could be adversely affected by any such change in or any new federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation 

risks that may not be insured in full or in part 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks discussed below 

insurance coverage for various risks can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical incidents that directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including increased maintenance repair and delays in construction in addition we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations the following risks are uninsurable or insurance coverage is limited due to premium rates see item 2 “communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” 

• earthquake risk as further described in item 2 “communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply 

• severe or inclement weather risk many of our markets particularly those located in coastal cities are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding 

• climate change risk to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions in addition changes in regulations based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties for example to improve energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

table of contents 

• terrorism and other risk we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc which have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms and in amounts we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various public health laws and regulations we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the presence or effects of hazardous or toxic substances such as asbestos lead paint chemical vapors from soils or groundwater petroleum product releases and natural substances such as methane and radon gas we may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate or contain the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties and may subject us to liability in connection with personal injury 

certain laws and regulations govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we have acquired although we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we may fail to adequately observe such program or a disturbance of acms may occur nevertheless exposing us to liability we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties 

table of contents 

we cannot assure you that 

• the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities 

• no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments 

• no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared 

• the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities such as the presence of underground storage tanks will not affect the environmental condition of our communities 

• future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations will not result in the imposition of environmental liability and 

• no environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability 

general risk factors 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued this could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but it is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law restricts some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations 

the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology or any noncompliance with applicable laws with respect to the use of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

table of contents 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

various laws and regulations and interpretations thereof as well as agreements with payment processors require or may require us to comply with rules related to our websites for use by residents and prospective residents including requirements related to accessibility of our websites to persons with disabilities and our handling and use of data we collect we could face liabilities for failure to comply with these requirements new statutes such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” and related regulations are evolving and may be subject to differing interpretations we could incur costs to comply with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the company

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further classified as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup redevelopment or unconsolidated according to the following attributes 

• established communities also known as same store communities for the year ended december 31 2020 are consolidated communities in the markets where we have a significant presence new england new yorknew jersey midatlantic pacific northwest northern and southern california and our expansion markets of southeast florida and denver colorado and where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as defined below as of the beginning of the respective prior year the established communities for the year ended december 31 2020 are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes had stabilized occupancy as of january 1 2019 are not conducting or are not probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or probable for disposition to unrelated third parties within the fiscal year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of i attainment of 90 physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment 

• other stabilized communities are all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy as defined above as of january 1 2020 or which were acquired during the years ended december 31 2020 or 2019 other stabilized communities for the year ended december 31 2020 excludes communities that are conducting or are probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the fiscal year 

• leaseup communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and that do not have stabilized occupancy 

• redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the fiscal year redevelopment is considered substantial when i capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of 5000000 or 10 of the communitys preredevelopment gross cost basis and ii physical occupancy is below or is expected to be below 90 during or as a result of the redevelopment activity 

• unconsolidated communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture 

development communities are consolidated communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

unconsolidated development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest where we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

table of contents 

as of december 31 2020 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

table of contents 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually changes in the established communities portfolios for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



 

1 we remove a community from our established communities portfolio if we believe that planned activity for the upcoming year will result in that communitys expected operations not being comparable to the prior year including when we intend either i to undertake a significant capital renovation such that the community will be classified as a redevelopment community ii to dispose of a community or iii when a significant casualty loss occurs 

2 includes the five whollyowned communities contributed to the nyc joint venture 

3 community was moved from the established communities portfolio to the other stabilized portfolio as a result of a casualty loss that occurred during the year and impacted operations 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings of stacked flats andor townhome apartments in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities consisting of larger elevatorserved buildings of four or more stories frequently with structured parking as of january 31 2021 our current communities consisted of the following 



table of contents 

as discussed in item 1 “business” we operate under three core brands avalon ava and e aves by avalon we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint our core “ avalon” brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services “ ava” targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus “e aves by avalon” is targeted to the cost conscious “value” segment in suburban areas in 2020 we introduced our kanso brand through one of our current development communities the kanso brand is designed to create an apartment living experience that offers simplicity without sacrifice at a more moderate price point – featuring highquality apartment homes limitedtono community amenities and supported by a lowtouch largely selfservice operating model that leverages technology and smart access we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by appealing to different consumer preferences 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team that is focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal we believe our mission of creating a better way to live helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 



table of contents 

we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2020 we completed construction of eight communities containing 2095 apartment homes and sold 10 operating communities containing 1887 apartment homes the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 199 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 111 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2021 we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

• 258 operating communities including 248 with a full fee simple or absolute ownership interest and 10 that are on land subject to a land lease the land leases have various expiration dates from may 2041 to march 2142 and four of the land leases are used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration 

• a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in archstone multifamily partners ac lp the “us fund” and multifamily partners ac jv lp the “ac jv” subsidiaries of which own three and two operating communities respectively 

• a membership interest in four limited liability companies one of the ventures the nyc joint venture through subsidiaries owns a fee simple interest in three operating communities and a leasehold interest in two additional operating communities the other three ventures that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community one of which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 

• a general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a “downreit” which is consolidated and owns one community in this partnership one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the limited partnership interests have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock at january 31 2021 there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding 

in addition to our current communities we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries a full fee simple ownership interest in our whollyowned development communities a membership interest in two limited liability companies that each hold an interest in an unconsolidated development community and a whollyowned mixeduse project with forsale condominiums 

development communities 

as of december 31 2020 we owned or held a direct interest in 16 development communities we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 5128 apartment homes and 62000 square feet of commercial space to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 1951000000 we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the factors identified under “forwardlooking statements” for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities 

table of contents 



 

1 projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective development community determined in accordance with gaap including land acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees as well as costs incurred for first generation commercial tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions 

2 initial projected occupancy dates are estimates 

3 stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of 90 or greater physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development 

4 development communities containing at least 10000 square feet of commercial space include ava hollywood 19000 square feet and avalon harrison 27000 square feet 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company completed the development of the following communities 

table of contents 



 

1 total capitalized cost is as of december 31 2020 we generally anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these communities that are customary for new developments 

unconsolidated development communities 

as of december 31 2020 we had an indirect interest in the following unconsolidated development communities 



 

1 projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective unconsolidated development community determined in accordance with gaap including land acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees and other regulatory fees as well as costs incurred for first generation commercial tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions projected total capitalized cost is the total projected joint venture amount 

2 initial projected occupancy dates are estimates 

3 ava arts district is expected to contain 56000 square feet of commercial space 

development rights 

at december 31 2020 we had 110142000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in five land parcels we own in addition we own the land for four development rights that are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and which will be constructed on land currently adjacent to or directly associated with those operating communities in addition we had 55427000 in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to 15 development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 24 development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these 

table of contents 

communities would ultimately add approximately 7853 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any unrecoverable capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2020 we incurred a charge of 12399000 for expensed transaction development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries which include development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined were no longer probable of being developed this charge includes the writeoff of 7264000 related to a development right in new york city with a projected total capitalized cost of 688000000 that we no longer expect is probable 

you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2020 we acquired the following land parcels for an aggregate investment of 114395000 



 

1 projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date if any and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community determined in accordance with gaap including land and related acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees as well as costs incurred for first generation commercial tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions net of projected proceeds for any planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate 

2 construction on this land parcel commenced during 2020 

3 land purchased for the expected development of two adjacent operating communities 

table of contents 

disposition activity 

we sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our periods of ownership and we generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a taxdeferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2020 to january 31 2021 we sold our interest in ten whollyowned operating communities containing 2055 apartment homes with an aggregate gross sales price of 699750000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities with insurance policies issued by a combination of third party insurers as well as a whollyowned captive insurance company these policies along with other insurance policies we maintain have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable we utilize a whollyowned captive insurance company to insure certain types and amounts of risks which include property damage and resulting business interruption losses general liability insurance and other construction related liability risks the captive is utilized to insure other limited levels of risk which may be in part reinsured by third party insurance there are however certain types of losses including but not limited to losses arising from nuclear liability pandemic or acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under part i item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or casualty loss 

our communities are insured for certain property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor a master property insurance program which covers the majority of our communities this master property program provides a 400000000 limit for any single occurrence subject to certain sublimits and exclusions under the master property program we are subject to various deductibles per occurrence as well as additional selfinsured retentions in addition to our potential liability for the various policy selfinsured retentions and deductibles our captive insurance company is directly responsible for 100 of the first 25000000 of losses per occurrence and 10 of the second 25000000 of losses per occurrence incurred by the master property insurance policy our master property insurance program includes coverage for losses resulting from wildfires and windstorm limits deductibles selfinsured retentions and coverages are consistent with customary market programs and may increase or decrease annually during the insurance renewal process which occurs on different dates throughout the calendar year 

many of our west coast communities are located within the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault the hayward fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels we procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with a loss limit of 175000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes however for any losses resulting from earthquakes at communities located in california or washington the loss limit is 200000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate 

our communities are insured for thirdparty liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance program the master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions our captive insurance company is directly responsible for covered liability claims arising out of our primary commercial general liability policy subject to a 2000000 per occurrence loss limit 

we also maintain certain casualty policies general liability umbrellaexcess and workers compensation for construction related risks which have various exclusions and deductibles that in management’s view are commercially reasonable 

table of contents 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism our communities are insured for terrorism related losses through the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” program this coverage extends to most of our casualty exposures subject to deductibles and insured limits and certain property insurance policies we have also purchased privatemarket insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of 600000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under part i item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also maintain a crime policy also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that applies to losses from employee theft of money securities or property and a cyber liability insurance policy that applies to losses from breaches of data privacy these policies are subject to maximum loss limits and include coverage limitations or exclusion that may preclude a full insurance recovery of losses related to employee theft or breaches of data privacy

2020 financial highlights 

net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2020 was 827630000 an increase of 41656000 or 53 as compared to the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains as well as noi from development and other stabilized communities in the current year these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in noi from established communities and communities sold in 2019 and 2020 and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year 

established communities noi for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 96395000 or 64 from the prior year the decrease was due to a decrease in rental revenue of 37 of which 43970000 was due to uncollectible lease revenue 33768000 of which was for residential revenue and 10202000 was for commercial revenue as well as an increase in property operating expenses of 17424000 or 29 over 2019 

during 2020 we raised approximately 2150622000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes and the sale of nine consolidated operating communities condominiums at the park loggia and other real estate this amount does not include our share of proceeds from joint venture dispositions we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

table of contents 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2020 we 

• completed the construction of eight consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 2095 apartment homes for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 777000000 

• started the construction of three consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 591 apartment homes which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 221000000 

• started the construction of one unconsolidated apartment community containing 475 apartment homes which is expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 276000000 or 69000000 when including only our 250 interest 

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources existing cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

covid19 pandemic 

we have taken various actions in response to the covid19 pandemic to adjust our business operations and to address the health and safety of our residents and associates during the year ended december 31 2020 we adopted varying measures to help mitigate the financial impact arising from the national emergency on our residents including providing flexible lease renewal options creating payment plans for residents who are unable to pay their rent because they are impacted by this national emergency and in certain jurisdictions waiving late fees and certain other customary fees associated with apartment rentals to the extent still implemented we may discontinue these measures at any time except where required by law 

the impact on our consolidated results of operations from covid19 for periods beyond 2020 will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic the effectiveness of vaccines and the timing of vaccine availability the duration and nature of governmental responses to contain the spread of the disease and cushion the impact on consumers the responses of consumers and businesses with respect to living and work preferences and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume the current and potential future impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business particularly on i rent levels collectibility of rents occupancy and the extent to which we waive certain other customary fees associated with our apartment rental business and ii development timing and volume mean that our historical results of operations and financial condition are not indicative of future results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted our rental operations including i revenues and expenses as well as ii our collections and associated outstanding receivables for further discussion see results of operations the following table presents the percentage of i apartment base rent charged to residents and ii other rentable items including parking and storage rent along with pet and other fees in accordance with residential leases that has been collected collected residential revenue for established communities for the three months ended june 30 2020 september 30 2020 and december 31 2020 collected residential revenue excludes transactional and other fees

communities overview 

as of december 31 2020 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 291 apartment communities containing 86025 apartment homes in 11 states and the district of columbia of which 16 consolidated communities were under development and one community was under redevelopment we have an indirect interest in 14 of the 291 apartment communities which were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including two that are being developed within joint ventures in addition we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 24 communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 7853 apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current communities development communities unconsolidated development communities and development rights our current communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities 

established communities are generally consolidated communities in markets where we have a significant presence that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years other stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy at the beginning of the current year or were acquired during the year leaseup communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the fiscal year unconsolidated communities are communities in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated entity a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities

results of operations 

as discussed above under “executive overview  covid19 pandemic” and elsewhere in this report the covid19 pandemic has affected our business and may continue to do so see also part i item 1a “risk factors” our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions development completions and development under construction and in leaseup loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2020 and 2019 follows dollars in thousands discussion of our operating results for 2019 and comparison to 2018 can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the companys form 10k filed with the sec on february 21 2020 



 

1 percent change is not meaningful 

net income attributable to common stockholders increased 41656000 or 53 to 827630000 in 2020 from 2019 primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains as well as noi from development and other stabilized communities in the current year these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in noi from established communities and communities sold in 2019 and 2020 and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year 

table of contents 

noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses expensed transaction development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries interest expense net gain loss on extinguishment of debt net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities depreciation expense corporate income tax benefit expense casualty and impairment gain loss net gain on sale of communities gain loss on other real estate transactions net forsale condominium activity and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



the noi decrease for 2020 as compared to 2019 consists of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



the decrease in our established communities noi in 2020 is due to a decrease in rental revenue of 37 of which 43970000 was due to uncollectible lease revenue 33768000 of which was for residential revenue and 10202000 was for commercial revenue as well as an increase in property operating expenses of 17424000 or 29 over 2019 

table of contents 

rental and other income for the consolidated portfolio decreased 22224000 or 10 in 2020 compared to the prior year due to an increase of 53298000 in uncollectible lease revenue as a result of the covid19 pandemic of which 39600000 relates to residential revenue and 13698000 relates to commercial revenue as well as decreased occupancy and rental rates at our established communities and revenue from communities sold in 2019 and 2020 partially offset by additional rental income generated from development completions development under construction and in leaseup and acquired operating communities 

during 2020 as a result of the pandemic we increased our use of residential concessions the increased concessions which are amortized on a straightline basis over the life of the respective leases generally one year contributed to the overall decline in our rental revenue in 2020 and will continue to impact rental revenue in 2021 the amortization of residential concessions increased by 21434000 in 2020 as compared to the prior year and the remaining net unamortized balance of residential concessions as of december 31 2020 was 35367000 

as discussed elsewhere in this report the covid19 impact and related economic regulatory and operating impacts are likely to continue to adversely affect our rental revenue and comparisons to prior year periods during the covid19 pandemic if job losses in our markets and nationally continue this would likely continue to decrease our ability to maintain andor increase rents andor maintain occupancy at our historical levels deteriorating financial conditions among our residents and commercial tenants as well as regulations that limit our ability to evict residents and tenants may continue to result in higher than normal uncollectible lease revenue the pandemic may also continue to depress demand among consumers for our apartments for a variety of other reasons including the following consumers whose income has declined who are working from home remotely or who cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants gyms and entertainment venues may decide during the pandemic to live in markets or submarkets that are less costly than ours low interest rates that are caused by government response to the pandemic may encourage consumers who would otherwise rent to seek out home ownership and various sources of demand for our apartments eg students corporate apartment homes seasonal jobrelated demand as in the entertainment industry may remain below prepandemic levels 

consolidated communities—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 73724 apartment homes for 2020 as compared to 72901 homes for 2019 the weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to 2593 for 2020 as compared to 2647 in 2019 

the following table presents the year to date change in rental revenue including the attribution of the change between rental rates and economic occupancy for established communities 



 

1 includes both residential and commercial rental revenue total established communities residential rental revenue decreased 32 in 2020 from 2019 

2 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents

the following table presents the change in rental revenue for established communities for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year 



 

1 uncollectible lease revenue increased 33768000 to 44829000 or 218 of total residential revenue as compared to 053 of total residential revenue for 2019 

2 consists primarily of 11157000 of recognized uncollectible commercial lease revenue of which 5514000 represents the writeoff of straight line rent receivables  

management development and other fees decreased 1141000 or 230 in 2020 as a result of dispositions by unconsolidated ventures resulting in lower property and asset management fees earned in the current year coupled with lower revenue within the ventures 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 21544000 or 50 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities the increase is also partially due to operating expenses at our established communities including increased turnover expenses and an increase in covid19 related costs for personal protective equipment and cleaning 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 9034000 or 24 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to overall operating costs including increased turnover expenses and an increase in covid19 related costs for personal protective equipment and cleaning 

property taxes increased 20228000 or 80 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities and increased assessments for the companys stabilized portfolio partially offset by decreased property taxes from dispositions 

for established communities property taxes increased 8390000 or 37 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased assessments and rates across the portfolio in the current year as well as successful appeals in the prior year in excess of those in the current year for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased 13224000 or 150 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to costs related to an increased investment in technology initiatives to improve efficiency in services for residents and prospects increased compensation related costs and advocacy contributions of 8558000 related to california proposition 21 in the current year proposition 21 was a california referendum that failed in the november 3 2020 election

expensed transaction development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries primarily reflect costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and therefore may vary significantly from year to year expensed transaction development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries increased 7408000 or 1484 in 2020 as compared to the prior year the amount for 2020 includes the writeoff of 7264000 related to a development right in new york city with a projected total capitalized cost of 688000000 that we no longer expect is probable 

interest expense net increased 10566000 or 52 in 2020 as compared to the prior year this category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity amortization of premiumdiscount on debt and interest income the increase in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest and interest income coupled with an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness in the current year this was partially offset by lower overall effective rates on unsecured indebtedness a combination of a decrease in variable rates on and amounts of secured indebtedness and gain on interest rate contract 

loss on the extinguishment of debt net reflects prepayment penalties the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired the loss of 9333000 in 2020 was primarily due to the repayments of unsecured notes during the year ahead of their scheduled maturity 

depreciation expense increased 45753000 or 69 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities partially offset by dispositions 

general and administrative expense “ga” increased 2301000 or 40 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to legal settlement proceeds that were present in the prior year partially offset by a decrease in compensation related expenses due to associate retirements in 2019 

equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities decreased 2230000 or 258 in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased noi from the ventures in the current year including dispositions and our acquisition of the 450 equity interest of ava north point that was owned by our venture partner in 2019 upon which we consolidated ava north point as a whollyowned operating community 

gain on sale of communities increased in 2020 as compared to the prior year the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area the gain of 340444000 in 2020 was primarily due to the sale of nine whollyowned operating communities the gain of 166105000 in 2019 was primarily due to the sale of six whollyowned operating communities 

net forsale condominium activity is a net gain of 2551000 for the year ended december 31 2020 and an expense of 3812000 for the year ended december 31 2019 and in 2020 is comprised of the gain before taxes on the sale of condominiums at the park loggia net of marketing operating and administrative costs during the year ended december 31 2020 we sold 70 residential condominiums at the park loggia for gross proceeds of 216372000 resulting in a gain in accordance with gaap of 8213000 in addition we incurred 5662000 and 3812000 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively in marketing operating and administrative costs 

income tax benefit expense of 3247000 for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to losses generated through taxable reit subsidiaries trs and provisions of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act allowing for further carryback of net operating losses income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2019 consists of 5782000 of income tax expenses for a deferred tax liability for the gaap to tax basis differences at the park loggia which is being realized as we sell the condominiums and 7221000 related to other activity we undertook through trss including the disposition of two whollyowned operating communities and expense for deferred tax liabilities related to our sustainability initiatives

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholders or “ffo” and ffo adjusted for noncore items or “core ffo” as defined below are generally considered by management to be appropriate supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance in calculating ffo we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies by further adjusting for items that are not considered by us to be part of our core business operations core ffo allows one to compare the core operating performance of the company year over year we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo and core ffo should be examined with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report 

consistent with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts® “nareit” we calculate ffo as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap adjusted for 

• gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities 

• cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

• impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets 

• writedowns of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates 

• depreciation of real estate assets and 

• similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures including those from a change in control 

we calculate core ffo as ffo adjusted for 

• joint venture gains if not adjusted through ffo noncore costs and promoted interests from partnerships 

• casualty and impairment losses or gains net on nondepreciable real estate 

• gains or losses from early extinguishment of consolidated borrowings 

• abandoned pursuits 

• business interruption insurance proceeds and the related lost noi that is covered by the expected business interruption insurance proceeds 

• property and casualty insurance proceeds and legal settlements 

• gains or losses on sales of assets not subject to depreciation 

• advocacy contributions representing payments to promote our business interests 

• hedge ineffectiveness or gains or losses from derivatives not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 

• severance related costs 

• net forsale condominium activity including gains marketing operating and administrative costs and imputed carry cost 

• income taxes and 

• other noncore items 

ffo and core ffo do not represent net income in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income which remains the primary measure as an indication of our performance in addition ffo and core ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to our calculations of ffo and core ffo 

ffo and core ffo also do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a presentation of gaap based cash flow metrics is included in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

the following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to ffo attributable to common stockholders and to core ffo attributable to common stockholders dollars in thousands except per share data

liquidity and capital resources 

we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management when we source capital we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility our principal focus on nearterm and intermediateterm liquidity is to ensure we have adequate capital to fund 

• development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged or in which we plan to engage 

• the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 

• debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity 

• normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses and 

• investment in our operating platform including strategic investments 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions cash flows from operations are determined by operating activities and factors including but not limited to i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels iv uncollectible lease revenue levels or interruptions in collections caused by market conditions and v operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage is affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital our plans for development redevelopment nonroutine capital expenditure acquisition and disposition activity are affected by market conditions and capital availability we frequently review our liquidity needs especially in periods with volatile market conditions as well as the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we had cash cash equivalents and cash in escrow of 313532000 at december 31 2020 an increase of 185918000 from 127614000 at december 31 2019 the following discussion relates to changes in cash cash equivalents and cash in escrow due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 1219615000 in 2020 from 1321804000 in 2019 primarily due to decreases in rental income including the impact of uncollectible lease revenue 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities totaled 179433000 in 2020 the net cash used was primarily due to 

• investment of 843907000 in the development and redevelopment of communities and 

• capital expenditures of 137036000 for our operating communities and nonreal estate assets primarily related to our corporate and certain regional offices 

these amounts are partially offset by 

• net proceeds from the disposition of nine operating communities of 619773000 and

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we have a 1750000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the “credit facility” which matures in february 2024 the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on i the london interbank offered rate “libor” applicable to the period of borrowing for a particular draw of funds from the facility eg one month to maturity three months to maturity etc and ii the rating levels issued for our unsecured notes the current stated pricing for drawn borrowings is libor plus 0775 per annum 089 at january 31 2021 assuming a one month borrowing rate the annual facility fee for the credit facility remained at 0125 resulting in a fee of 2188000 annually based on the 1750000000 facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 2900000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2021 in addition we had 32943000 outstanding in additional letters of credit on a separate facility unrelated to the credit facility as of january 31 2021 

the phaseout of libor and expected transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects on our libor borrowings see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial covenants contained in the credit facility term loans and the indentures under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

• limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure 

• limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by propertyspecific financing and 

• minimum levels of debt service coverage 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2020 

in addition some of our secured borrowings include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in may 2019 we commenced our fifth continuous equity program cep v under which we may sell andor enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of up to 1000000000 of our common stock from time to time actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep v we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold we expect that if entered into we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement in connection with each forward sale agreement we will pay the relevant forward seller in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price a commission of up to 15 of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold during 2020 and through january 31 2021 we had no sales under the program as of january 31 2021 there are no outstanding forward sale agreements and we had 752878000 remaining authorized for issuance under this program 

forward interest rate swap agreements 

the following activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2020 

• we settled an aggregate of 600000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements making aggregate payments of 25135000 of the positions settled by us 250000000 were forward interest swaps that we had entered into during 2020 the settled positions were comprised of the following 

table of contents 

◦ in conjunction with the issuance of our 700000000 unsecured notes due 2030 in february 2020 we settled 350000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes making a payment of 20314000 

◦ in conjunction with the issuance of our 600000000 unsecured notes due 2031 in may 2020 we settled 250000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes making a payment of 4821000 

we have deferred these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are recognizing the impact as a component of interest expense net over the term of the respective hedged debt 

• we entered into an additional 150000000 of new forward interest rate swap agreements that were executed to reduce the impact of variability of interest rates on a portion of expected debt issuance activity in 2021 the swaps based on changes in our expected capital needs in 2021 as of december 31 2020 while we may still issue debt in 2021 it is no longer probable that we will issue the debt for which the swaps were executed as a result we ceased hedge accounting and recognized a gain of 2894000 for the change in fair of the swaps for the three months ended december 31 2020 in january 2021 we terminated the swaps and received a payment of 6962000 

stock repurchase program 

in july 2020 our board of directors voted to terminate our prior 500000000 stock repurchase program the amended 2005 stock repurchase program and approved a new stock repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of 500000000 the 2020 stock repurchase program purchases of common stock under the 2020 stock repurchase program may be exercised from time to time in our discretion and in such amounts as market conditions warrant the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities the 2020 stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice as of january 31 2021 we repurchased 1225790 shares of common stock at an average price of 14999 per share of which all activity took place during the year ended december 31 2020 as of january 31 2021 we had 316148000 remaining authorized for purchase under this program 

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that capital from additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory especially in light of the uncertain impacts of the covid19 pandemic on capital markets 

the following debt activity occurred during 2020 

• in february 2020 we issued 700000000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately 694701000 the notes mature in march 2030 and were issued at a 230 interest rate

future financing and capital needs—portfolio and capital markets activity 

in light of the covid19 pandemic we continue to monitor the availability of our various capital raising alternatives in 2021 we expect to meet our liquidity needs from one or more a variety of internal and external sources which may include i real estate dispositions ii cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities iii borrowing capacity under our credit facility and iv secured and unsecured debt financings additional sources of liquidity in 2021 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects in addition the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on capital markets including the availability and costs of debt and equity capital remain uncertain and may have material adverse effects on our access to capital on attractive terms 

before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity in 2021 including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures we plan to source sufficient capital to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

table of contents 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities and new markets where our partners bring development and operational expertise andor experience to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop redevelop or acquire the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments  operating communities 

as of december 31 2020 we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures refer to note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results for ventures holding operating apartment communities as of december 31 2020 detail of the real estate and associated indebtedness underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table dollars in thousands

1 we have not guaranteed the debt of these unconsolidated investees and bear no responsibility for the repayment 

2 borrowing on this community is comprised of two mortgage loans the interest rate is the weighted average interest rate as of december 31 2020 

3 borrowing on this dualbranded community is comprised of a single mortgage loan 

4 borrowing is comprised of a loan made by the equity investors in the venture in proportion to their equity interests 

during 2020 the us fund sold one community containing 70 apartment homes and 9000 square feet of commercial space for 65000000 our share of the gain in accordance with gaap was 5157000 in conjunction with the disposition of the community the us fund repaid 27117000 of secured indebtedness at par 

unconsolidated investments  development communities 

during 2020 we entered into a joint venture to develop own and operate ava arts district an apartment community located in los angeles ca which is currently under construction and expected to contain 475 apartment homes and 56000 square feet of commercial space when completed we own a 250 interest in the venture with a total expected equity investment of 27600000 of which 19500000 has already been contributed the venture has secured a 165600000 variable rate construction loan to fund approximately 60 of the development of ava arts district of which no amounts have been drawn as of december 31 2020 the venture will commence draws under the loan subsequent to required equity contributions by the venture partners we have guaranteed the construction loan on behalf of the venture and any obligations we may incur under the construction loan guarantee except to the extent that our misconduct gave rise to the obligation are required capital contributions of the partners based on ownership interest 

in addition we have a 500 interest in avalon alderwood mf member llc a joint venture to develop own and operate avalon alderwood mall an apartment community located in lynnwood wa which is currently under construction and expected to contain 328 apartment homes when complete 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

unless otherwise noted we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities as referenced in the tables above nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so in the future in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support or take any other action as any such action would depend on a variety of factors including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities andor our returns by providing time for performance to improve 

there are no other material lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest

contractual obligations 

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2020 dollars in thousands 



 

1 interest payments on variable rate debt obligations are calculated based on the rate as of december 31 2020 

2 includes ground leases expiring between may 2041 and march 2142 amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the ground leases 

3 aggregate finance lease payments include 24300 in interest costs 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 

forwardlooking statements

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

risks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include those related to the covid19 pandemic about which there are many uncertainties including i the duration and severity of the pandemic ii the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and relieve economic distress of consumers such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent and iii the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic due to this uncertainty we are not able at this time to estimate the effect of these factors on our business but the adverse impact of the pandemic on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be material in addition the effects of the pandemic are likely to heighten the following risks which we routinely face in our business 

• we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals 

• we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable increases in costs of development increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability resulting in losses 

• construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates 

• we may not complete construction and leaseup of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues 

• the timing and net proceeds of condominium sales may not equal our current expectations 

• occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control 

• financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities 

• the impact of new landlordtenant laws and rent regulations may be greater than we expect 

• our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

• we may be unsuccessful in our management of joint ventures and the reit vehicles that are used with certain joint ventures 

• laws and regulations implementing rent control or rent stabilization or otherwise limiting our ability to increase rents charge fees or evict tenants may impact our revenue or increase our costs 

• our expectations estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding outstanding legal proceedings are subject to change and 

• the possibility that we may choose to pay dividends in our stock instead of cash which may result in stockholders having to pay taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if any 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 45268000 and 48168000 for 2020 and 2019 respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate as of december 31 2020 capitalized pursuit costs associated with development rights totaled 55427000 

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our direct and indirect investments in real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes during 2020 we settled an aggregate of 600000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with our february 2020 and may 2020 unsecured note issuances of which 250000000 had been entered into during 2020 during 2020 we entered into an additional 150000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2021 based on changes in our expected capital needs in 2021 as of december 31 2020 while we may still issue debt in 2021 it is no longer probable that we will issue the debt for which the swaps were executed and as a result we ceased hedge accounting 

in addition we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had 720850000 and 1026150000 respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2020 and 2019 our annual interest incurred would have increased by approximately 8289000 and 11221000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 7629814000 at december 31 2020 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 8315775000 at december 31 2020 contractual fixed rate debt represented 7692497000 of the fair value at december 31 2020 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2020 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 1224574000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily communities in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california as well as our expansion markets consisting of denver colorado and southeast florida we focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics 

at january 31 2020  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

 

 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm shareholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital we pursue our development redevelopment investment and operating activities with the purpose of creating a better way to live  our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava and eaves by avalon described in item 2 communities we pursue our development and redevelopment activities primarily through inhouse development and inhouse redevelopment teams which are complemented by our inhouse acquisition platform we believe that our organizational structure which includes dedicated development and operational teams in each of our regions and strong culture are key differentiators providing us with highly talented dedicated and capable associates 

during the three years ended december 31 2019  we 

 

 

 

 

 

a more detailed description of our unconsolidated real estate entities and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site after the completion of entitlements and shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities or in locations where we have limited historical experience where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when real estate market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity by redeploying the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other terms of each proposal 

as part of the archstone acquisition in 2013 as defined in item 1 “business” in the companys form 10k filed february 22 2019 we acquired and still own 14 assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on the contributed assets our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don’t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the archstone partnership after review and investigation of archstone’s tax and accounting records we estimate that had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2019 with respect to all 14 assets the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately 47800000  at the present time we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income “noi” 

while we have achieved growth in the past through the establishment of discretionary real estate investments funds which placed certain limitations on our ability to acquire new communities during their investments periods we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 



 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue expense noi and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction we provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes see “tax matters” below 

financing strategy our financing strategy is to endeavor to maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to help ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1750000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would develop andor own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2019  we had a total of approximately 787000 square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under development gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2019 was 32627000  14 of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail or forsale residential components of a mixeduse building or project that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we conduct many of the administrative functions associated with our property operations including billing collections and response to resident inquiries through an internally operated shared services center rather than having onsite associates conduct such activities we believe that this centralized platform allows our onsite associates to focus more on current and prospective resident services while at the same time enabling us to reduce costs mitigate risk and increase our availability and responsiveness to our residents we are exploring the possibility of performing these shared service center administrative functions for a third party as a means of creating an additional revenue stream and economies of scale at our center we cannot assure that we will provide such services to a third party or that it will be successful if we do so 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a reit with limited exceptions such as those described under “property management strategy” above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds reits both in the multifamily as well as other sectors and other well capitalized investors to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose pricing may be perceived as a better value given the quality location terms and amenities that the prospective resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment construction and operating risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

the construction and maintenance of our communities include a risk of major casualty events that could materially damage our property and the property of others and pose the risk of personal injury while we carry insurance for such risks in amounts we deem reasonable we cannot assure that such insurance will be adequate and when we have incurred and in the future may incur such casualties we are subject to losses on account of deductibles and selfinsured amounts in any event such casualties may also expose us in the future to higher insurance premiums greater construction or operating costs either voluntarily assumed by us or as a result of new local regulations and risks to our reputation among prospective residents or municipalities from which we may seek approvals in the future all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our real estate assets 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

rent control and other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlordtenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

we have seen a recent increase in states and municipalities implementing considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit the amount by which we can raise rents or charge nonrent fees for example in 2019 the state of california adopted statewide rent control for communities older than fifteen years limiting rent increases to the lesser of 10 or 5 plus local cpi also in 2019 the state of new york adopted new rules for rentcontrolled and rentstabilized units that revised and limited the way rent increases are calculated for renewal leases basing increases solely on rent actually paid and eliminating the ability to increase the renewal rent to a higher “registered rent” furthermore in california the governor has the ability to enact local or statewide states of emergency which limit our ability to increase new and renewal rents more than 10 over the rent in place on the date such state of emergency was declared which has impacted some of our california communities these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs such laws and regulations may limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes for rent and short term furnished offerings such as those available from extended stay hotels and through online services such as airbnb in addition our residents and prospective residents also consider as an alternative to renting the purchase of a new or existing condominium or singlefamily home for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability for new investments 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets or reducing our cash dividend to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing absent changes in other factors our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our available cash will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest on our debt in this regard in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock and efforts to hedge such risk could be ineffective and cause us to incur costs 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we use interest rate derivatives to hedge and manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks for example from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the expected issuance of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges to our earnings in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing and implementing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can 

be no assurance that our hedging activities will be effective termination of these hedging agreements may involve net costs such as transaction fees settlement costs andor breakage costs 

bond financing and zoning and other compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning or an agreement relating to property taxes in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2019  52 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and as a consequence may also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions in addition if we fail to observe these commitments we could lose benefits such as reduced property taxes or face liabilities including liability for the benefits we received under tax exempt bonds tax credits or agreements related to property taxes 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

the phaseout of libor and transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects 

in 2018 the alternative reference rate committee identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities published by the federal reserve bank of new york by the end of 2021 it is expected that no new contracts will reference libor and will instead use sofr due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate all financial market participants including the company are impacted by the risks associated with this transition the impact of this transition on the interest rates charged the company and the terms of lending agreements are uncertain and could possibly adversely affect our financing costs including spread pricing on our credit facility and variable rate unsecured term loans  the term loans and certain other floating rate debt obligations as well as our operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to cost effective debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividend received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

we may experience regulatory or economic barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable 

from time to time we dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as “likekind exchanges” under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse tax consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise for example in 2017 we entered the denver colorado and southeast florida markets where we have now engaged and continue to pursue development and acquisition opportunities our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets we may be exposed to a variety of risks when we enter a new market including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily rental business we also own and lease ancillary retail and commercial space in particular when such tenants represent the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments gross rental revenue provided by leased retailcommercial space in our portfolio represented 14 of our total revenue in 2019  the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases and characteristics of many of our tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity for example we are proceeding with the sale of the residential condominiums at the park loggia a mixeduse development located in new york new york we may be unsuccessful at developing real estate with the intent to sell or in selling condominiums as a disposition strategy for an asset which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “communities—other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

we are exposed to various risks from our real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring developing or maintaining ownership of apartment communities as a whollyowned investment at times we invest in real estate as a partner or a coventurer with other investors joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell or similar arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest acquire our partners interest or force a sale of the asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds and joint ventures  

we have investment interests in unconsolidated real estate entities collectively ventures ranging from 200 to 500  the ventures present risks including the following 

 

we are exposed to risks associated with real estate assets that are subject to ground leases that may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in those assets limit our use and expose us to loss if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

we own assets which are subject to the terms of longterm ground leases these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to operate the properties in addition we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us terminated or lapse as we get closer to the lease termination dates the values of the properties could decrease if we are unable to agree upon an extension of the lease with the lessor certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations andor periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology or any noncompliance with applicable laws with respect to the use of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis we also maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches 

however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

various laws and regulations and interpretations thereof as well as agreements with payment processors require or may require us to comply with rules related to our websites for use by residents and prospective residents including requirements related to accessibility of our websites to persons with disabilities and our handling and use of data we collect we could face liabilities for failure to comply with these requirements new statutes such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” and related regulations are evolving and may be subject to differing interpretations we could incur costs to comply with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards 

expanding social media vehicles present new risks 

the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation in addition employees or others might disclose nonpublic sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels the continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks discussed below 

earthquake risk as further described in item 2 “communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical 

severe or inclement weather risk we are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding severe or inclement weather may result in increased costs resulting from increased maintenance repair of water and wind damage removal of snow and ice and in the case of our development communities delays in construction that result in increased construction costs and delays in realizing rental revenues from a community 

a single catastrophe that affects one of our regions such as an earthquake that affects the west coast or a hurricane or severe winter storm that affects the midatlantic metro new yorknew jersey or new england regions may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

climate change risk to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

terrorism risk we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc which have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage and that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms and in amounts we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical if an uninsured property 

loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we have acquired although we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we may fail to adequately observe such program or a disturbance of acms may occur nevertheless exposing us to liability 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 

  

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to regular us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our stockholders in addition we hold through our taxable reit subsidiaries certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary or to engage in activities that generate nonqualifying reit income our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to us tax as regular corporations the archstone acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations 

the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the fasb and the sec create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position 

prospective investors are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the effects of recently enacted tax legislation and other legislative regulatory and administrative developments 

on december 22 2017 hr 1 informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted the tcja made major changes to the code including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their stockholders the longterm effect of the significant changes made by the tcja remains uncertain the effect of any technical corrections with respect to the tcja could have an adverse effect on us or our stockholders or holders of our debt securities 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but it is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup redevelopment or unconsolidated according to the following attributes 

 

beginning january 1 2020 we have updated our definition of stabilized occupancy as the earlier of i attainment of 90 physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment in addition beginning january 1 2020 established communities will also include consolidated communities in our expansion markets of denver colorado and southeast florida these changes will be applied prospectively to all periods presented 

 

 

 

beginning january 1 2020 we have updated our definition of redevelopment communities to consist of consolidated communities that have i substantial redevelopment in progress or that is planned to begin during the fiscal year through a capital investment during the reconstruction effort that is expected to exceed the lesser of 5000000 or 10 of the communitys preredevelopment cost basis and ii physical occupancy that is below or is expected to be below 90 during or as a result of the redevelopment activity these changes will be applied prospectively to all periods presented 

 

development communities are communities that are either currently under construction or were under construction and completed during the fiscal year these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest where we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

as of december 31 2019  communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually changes in the established communities portfolios for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were as follows 



 

 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings of stacked flats andor townhome apartments in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities consisting of larger elevatorserved buildings of four or more stories frequently with structured parking as of january 31 2020  our current communities consisted of the following 



as discussed in item 1 “business” we operate under three core brands avalon ava and eaves by avalon we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint our core “ avalon” brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services “ ava” targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus “ eaves by avalon” is targeted to the cost conscious “value” segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of creating a better way to live helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 



we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2019  we completed construction of seven communities containing 2027 apartment homes acquired five whollyowned operating communities containing 1175 apartment homes and sold six whollyowned operating communities containing 1660 apartment homes the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 195 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 103 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2020  we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

 

 

 

 

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple or leasehold ownership interest in our development communities except for one which is being developed within an unconsolidated joint venture in addition we own a mixeduse project for which we are pursuing a forsale strategy of individual condominium units 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2020  there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 

development communities 

as of december 31 2019  we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in 22 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 6960 apartment homes and 64000 square feet of retail space to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 2596000000  we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the factors identified under “forwardlooking statements” for further discussion of development activity 

during 2019 we completed the construction of the park loggia located in new york ny which contains 172 forsale residential condominium units and 67000 square feet of retail space for an estimated total capitalized cost of 626000000  we currently intend to own and operate the retail portion of the development in 2020 through the date on which this report was filed with the sec we sold 14 residential condominiums at the park loggia for gross proceeds of approximately 47000000  in addition we have contracts outstanding on 41 of the remaining residential condominiums 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a fee simple ownership interest in these communities directly or through a whollyowned subsidiary unless otherwise noted in the table 



 

 

during the year ended december 31 2019  the company completed the development of the following communities 



 

 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2019  we had two communities containing 665 apartment homes under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 45000000  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

development rights 

at december 31 2019  we had 70486000 in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 27 development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 9587 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 22 development rights we control the land through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the parcel in addition five development rights are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and will be constructed on land currently associated with or adjacent to those operating communities 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any unrecoverable capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2019  we incurred a charge of 4991000 for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined were no longer probable of being developed 

you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the following presents a summary of the development rights 



 

 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2019  we acquired land parcels for five development rights as shown in the table below for an aggregate investment of 63864000  for all of the parcels construction has either started or is expected to start within the next six months 



 

 

disposition activity 

we sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our periods of ownership and we generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2019 to january 31 2020  we sold our interest in seven whollyowned operating communities containing 1910 apartment homes with an aggregate gross sales price of 492350000

we maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies along with other insurance policies we maintain have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses including but not limited to losses arising from nuclear liability or acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or casualty loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault the hayward fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels we procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with a loss limit of 175000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes however for any losses resulting from earthquakes at communities located in california or washington the loss limit is 200000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate the deductible applicable to losses resulting from earthquakes occurring in california is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building subject to a minimum of 100000 and a maximum of 25000000 per loss limits deductibles selfinsured retentions and coverages may increase or decrease annually during the insurance renewal process which occurs on different dates throughout the calendar year 

our communities are insured for certain property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor a master property insurance program which covers the majority of our communities this master property program provides a 400000000 limit for any single occurrence subject to certain sublimits and exclusions under the master property program we are subject to a 100000 deductible per occurrence as well as additional selfinsured retention for the next 350000 of loss per occurrence until the aggregate incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1500000 for the policy year 

our communities are insured for thirdparty liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance program the master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions and they require a selfinsured retention of 500000 per occurrence 

we also maintain certain casualty policies general liability umbrellaexcess and workers compensation for construction related risks which have various exclusions and deductibles that in management’s view are commercially reasonable certain projects are insured through our master insurance policies while others are insured through projectspecific insurance policies the limits vary by project and may be subject to deductibles up to 1500000 per occurrence 

we utilize a whollyowned captive insurance company to insure certain types and amounts of risks which includes property damage and resulting business interruption losses general liability insurance and other construction related liability risks in addition to our potential liability for the various policy selfinsured retentions and deductibles our captive insurance company is directly responsible for i 50 of the first 25000000 of losses per occurrence and 10 of the first 50000000 of losses per occurrence incurred by the master property insurance policy and ii covered liability claims arising out of our primary commercial 

general liability policy subject to a 2000000 per occurrence loss limit the captive is utilized to insure other limited levels of risk which may be in part reinsured by third party insurance 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism our communities are insured for terrorism related losses through the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” program this coverage extends to most of our casualty exposures subject to deductibles and insured limits and certain property insurance policies we have also purchased privatemarket insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of 600000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy and limited cyber liability insurance the crime policies protect us up to 30000000 per occurrence subject to sublimits and exclusions from employee theft of money securities or property the limited cyber liability insurance is part of our professional liability coverage and has limits of 15000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate the cyber liability coverage protects us from certain claims arising out of data breach wrongful acts data privacy issues and media liability 

the amount or types of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover all losses

executive overview 

business description 

our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets 

we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics we believe that the denver colorado and southeast florida markets share these characteristics and in 2017 we began to invest in these markets through acquisitions and developments we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 

2019 financial highlights 

net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2019 was 785974000  a decrease of 188551000  or 193  from the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in real estate sales and related gains increases in depreciation expense and income tax expense and decreases in joint venture real estate gains from the prior year these amounts were partially offset by increases in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities as well as decreases in interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt net from the prior year 

established communities noi for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 39149000  or 31  over the prior year the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 29  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 28 over 2018  

during 2019  we raised approximately 1278098000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes sale of common shares under cep iv and v including settlement of the forward and the sale of consolidated operating communities and other real estate this amount does not include proceeds from joint venture dispositions the funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of six operating communities and two ancillary land parcels we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2019  we 

 

 

 

we also achieved portfolio growth through acquisitions acquiring five consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 1175 apartment homes for an aggregate purchase price of 345450000  in addition we purchased our joint venture partners 450 interest in one operating community for 71280000  obtaining a 100 ownership interest in that community 

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources existing cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

communities overview 

as of december 31 2019 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 297 apartment communities containing 86846 apartment homes in 11 states and the district of columbia of which 22 communities were under development and two communities were under redevelopment of these communities 14 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including five owned by the nyc joint venture four owned by the us fund two owned by the ac jv and one that is being developed within a joint venture in addition we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 27 whollyowned communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 9587 apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current communities development communities and development rights our current communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities 

established communities are generally consolidated communities in markets where we have a significant presence that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years other stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the fiscal year leaseup communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the fiscal year unconsolidated communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2019 and 2018 follows dollars in thousands discussion of our operating results for 2017 and comparison to 2018 can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the companys form 10k filed with the sec on february 22 2019 



 

 2 percent change is not meaningful 

net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 188551000  or 193  to 785974000 in 2019 from 2018  primarily attributable to decreases in real estate sales and related gains increases in depreciation expense and income tax expense and decreases in joint venture real estate gains from the prior year these amounts were partially offset by increases in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities as well as decreases in interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt net from the prior year 

noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses expensed transaction development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries interest expense net loss gain on extinguishment of debt net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities depreciation expense corporate income tax benefit expense casualty and impairment loss gain net gain on sale of communities loss gain on other real estate transactions net forsale condominiums marketing and administrative costs and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



  

the noi increase for 2019 as compared to 2018 consists of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



the increase in our established communities noi in 2019 is due to increased rental rates partially offset by increased operating expenses 

historically for years prior to january 1 2019 we presented charges related to uncollectible lease revenue in operating expenses with the adoption of asu 201602 leases we are presenting such charges as an adjustment to revenue in our consolidated financial statements on a prospective basis as of january 1 2019 for reported segment financial information for the year ended december 31 2018  including for established communities as discussed below we have also included such charges as an adjustment to revenue for all prior years presented in order to provide comparability 

rental and other income increased in 2019 compared to the prior year due to additional rental income generated from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our established communities partially offset by a decrease in rental income from communities sold the change in classification of charges for uncollectible lease revenue as described above partially offsets the increase in rental and other income for the year ended december 31 2019 over the prior year 

consolidated communities—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities decreased to 72901 apartment homes for 2019  as compared to 73385 homes for 2018  the weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2647 for 2019 as compared to 2588 in 2018  

the following table presents the year to date change in rental revenue including the attribution of the change between rental rates and economic occupancy for established communities 



 

 

 

management development and other fees increased 1388000  or 389  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased property management fees earned from the nyc joint venture that was formed in december 2018 partially offset by lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from the us fund and the ac jv 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes decreased 14041000  or 32  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the change in classification of charges for uncollectible lease revenue as described above as well as a decrease from dispositions in the prior and current years partially offset by an increase due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 7974000  or 25  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased property insurance costs compensation and maintenance expense 

property taxes increased 11398000  or 47  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities and increased assessments for the companys stabilized portfolio partially offset by decreased property taxes from dispositions 

for established communities property taxes increased 6103000  or 33  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased assessments and rates in the current year in the companys east coast and northern and southern california markets as well as successful appeals in the companys pacific northwest market in the prior year these increases are partially offset by decreased tax rates in the pacific northwest and a successful appeal in northern california in the current year for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased 4193000  or 50  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased compensation related costs and spending on corporate initiatives in the current year partially offset by decreased advocacy contributions in the current year compared to the prior year 

expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries primarily reflect costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and therefore may vary significantly from year to year expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries increased 1726000  or 529  in 2019 as compared to the prior year 

interest expense net decreased 17389000  or 79  in 2019 as compared to the prior year this category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity amortization of premiumdiscount on debt and interest income the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding consolidated secured indebtedness and an increase in capitalized interest partially offset by an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness 

loss on the extinguishment of debt net reflects prepayment penalties the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired loss on the extinguishment of debt net decreased 16890000  or 966  in 2019 as compared to the prior year the loss of 17492000 in 2018 was due to 

 

 

depreciation expense increased 30382000  or 48  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities partially offset by dispositions 

general and administrative expense “ga” decreased 2327000  or 39  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to legal settlement proceeds related to a former development right and a construction defect at a community partially offset by an increase in compensation related expenses in the current year 

equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities decreased 6618000  or 433  in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to gains on the sale of communities in various ventures in the prior year coupled with noncash charges for the depreciation of inplace leases associated with purchase accounting within the nyc joint venture which were not present in the prior year 

gain on sale of communities decreased in 2019 as compared to the prior year the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area the gain of 166105000 in 2019 was primarily due to the sale of six whollyowned operating communities the gain of 374976000 in 2018 was primarily due to the sale of eight whollyowned operating communities and the recognition of the gain associated with the contribution of five whollyowned operating communities to the nyc joint venture a venture in which we retained a 200 interest 

forsale condominium marketing and administrative costs consist of costs associated with the forsale condominiums of the park loggia 

income tax expense of 13003000 for the year ended december 31 2019 consists of 5782000 of income tax expense primarily related to a net deferred tax liability for the gaap to tax basis differences at the park loggia and 7221000 of current and deferred tax expense related to other activity we undertook through taxable reit subsidiaries trs including the disposition of two whollyowned operating communities and our sustainability initiatives 

liquidity and capital resources 

we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management when we source capital we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 127614000 at december 31 2019  a decrease of 90250000 from 217864000 at december 31 2018  the following discussion relates to changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 1321804000 in 2019 from 1301111000 in 2018  the change was driven primarily by increased noi from existing acquired and newly developed communities 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities totaled 1193869000 in 2019  the net cash used was primarily due to 

 

these amounts are partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate of 422041000  

financing activities—net cash used in financing activities totaled 218185000 in 2019  the net cash used was primarily due to 

 

these amounts are partially offset by 

 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

on february 28 2019 we entered into a 1750000000 fifth amended and restated revolving loan agreement the “credit facility” with a syndicate of banks which replaces our prior 1500000000 credit facility dated as of january 14 2016 the term of the credit facility ends on february 28 2024 

  

the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on i the london interbank offered rate “libor” applicable to the period of borrowing for a particular draw of funds from the facility eg one month to maturity three months to maturity etc and ii the rating levels issued for our unsecured notes the current stated pricing for drawn borrowings is libor plus 0775 per annum  244 at january 31 2020  assuming a one month borrowing rate the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus 070 to libor plus 145 based upon the rating of our unsecured notes the credit facility also provides a competitive bid option that is available for borrowings of up to 65 of the credit facility amount this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing than the stated rate if market conditions allow the annual facility fee for the credit facility remained at 0125  resulting in a fee of 2188000 annually based on the 1750000000 facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we had 110000000 outstanding under the credit facility and had 6632000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2020  in addition we had 28767000 outstanding in additional letters of credit as of january 31 2020  

the phaseout of libor and expected transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects on our libor borrowings see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial covenants contained in the credit facility term loans and the indentures under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2019  

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in december 2015 we commenced a fourth continuous equity program “cep iv” under which we were able to sell andor enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of up to 1000000000 of its common stock from time to time in conjunction with cep iv we engaged sales agents who received compensation of up to 20 of the gross sales price for shares sold 

in may 2019 we replaced cep iv with a new continuous equity program cep v under which we may sell andor enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of up to 1000000000 of our common stock from time to time actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep v we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold we expect that if entered into we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement in connection with each forward sale agreement we will pay the relevant forward seller in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price a commission of up to 15 of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold during 2019 we entered into and settled a forward sales agreement as discussed below 

on september 25 2019 we entered into a forward contract under cep v to sell 947868 shares of common stock the forward the sales price was established based on the stock price during intraday trading on september 25 2019 in december 2019 we issued 947868 shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of 20796 per share for net proceeds of 197122000  in settlement of the forward the proceeds received were determined on the date of settlement with adjustments during the term of the contract for our dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varied with changes in the overnight bank funding rate 

in addition to the shares issued in settlement of the forward in 2019  we sold 755054 shares at an average sales price of 19826 per share for net proceeds of 147450000 under cep iv and 239580 shares at an average sales price of 20870 per share for net proceeds of 49250000 under cep v we have not engaged in sales activity subsequent to december 31 2019  as of january 31 2020  we had 752878000 remaining authorized for issuance under cep v 

forward interest rate swap agreements 

in 2019  in conjunction with the issuance of our 330 notes due 2029 we settled 250000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability of the unsecured notes making a payment of 12309000  

in addition in 2019 we entered into 350000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2020 which are outstanding as of december 31 2019  in february 2020 in conjunction with the pricing of the 700000000 principal amount of 230 unsecured notes due in 2030 discussed below we settled 350000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements making a payment of 20314000  

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

in addition to the credit facility the following debt activity occurred during 2019  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in february 2020 we priced an underwritten public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for 700000000 principal amount of 230 unsecured notes due in 2030 we anticipate receiving the net proceeds from this borrowing on february 25 2020 in addition we called for redemption of i 400000000 principal amount of our 3625 unsecured notes in advance of the october 2020 scheduled maturity and ii 250000000 principal amount of our 395 unsecured notes in advance of the january 2021 scheduled maturity in conjunction with the redemption of the outstanding unsecured notes due in october 2020 and january 2021 we anticipate recognizing a loss on debt extinguishment comprised of approximately 9300000 in prepayment penalties and the noncash writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs 

the following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2019 and 2018 dollars in thousands we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest 



 

 

future financing and capital needs—portfolio and capital markets activity 

in 2020  we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources which may include i real estate dispositions ii cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities iii borrowing capacity under our credit facility and iv secured and unsecured debt financings additional sources of liquidity in 2020 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects 

before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities and new markets where our partners bring development and operational expertise andor experience to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop redevelop or acquire the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

as of december 31 2019  we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures and limited liability company agreements we entered into through subsidiaries with equity residential in conjunction with the archstone acquisition collectively the “residual jv” refer to note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results for ventures holding operating apartment communities as of december 31 2019  detail of the real estate and associated indebtedness underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table dollars in thousands 



 

 

us fund —during 2019 the us fund sold one community and the adjacent marina containing 205 apartment homes and 229 boat slips for an aggregate sales price of 86000000  our share of the gain in accordance with gaap was 5788000  in conjunction with the disposition of the community the us fund repaid 49800000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of its scheduled maturity date 

north point ii jv lp —during 2016 we entered into a joint venture with an institutional investor to develop own and operate ava north point an apartment community located in cambridge ma which completed construction during 2018 and contains 265 apartment homes we owned a 550 interest in the venture and the venture partner owned the remaining 450 interest during 2019 we acquired the 450 equity interest of ava north point that was owned by our venture partner for a purchase price of 71280000  upon acquisition we consolidated ava north point as a whollyowned operating community 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities as referenced in the table above nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so in the future in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support or take any other action as any such action would depend on a variety of factors including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities andor our returns by providing time for performance to improve 

there are no other material lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest 

contractual obligations 

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2019 dollars in thousands 



 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

recent us federal income tax updates 

this summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice this discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances 

the following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment” in the prospectus dated february 23 2018 contained in our registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on february 23 2018 

consolidated appropriations act and proposed regulations updates 

on march 23 2018 the consolidated appropriations act 2018 the “caa” was enacted the caa amended various provisions of the code and implicate certain taxrelated disclosures contained in the prospectus also on june 7 2019 the internal revenue service promulgated proposed treasury regulations under section 897 of the code regarding qualified foreign pension funds while these proposed treasury regulations have not yet been finalized taxpayers generally may rely on the proposed treasury regulations as a result the discussion under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmentus taxation of nonus stockholdersspecial firpta rules” of the prospectus is replaced with the following paragraphs 

special firpta rules to the extent our stock is held directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships by a “qualified shareholder” it will not be treated as a us real property interest for such qualified shareholder further to the extent such treatment applies any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest for these purposes a qualified shareholder is generally a nonus stockholder that ia is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the united states that includes an exchange of information program and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty or b is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the united states and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units having a value greater than 50 of the value of all partnership units on the new york stock exchange or nasdaq ii is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” within the meaning of section 897k3b of the code and iii maintains records of persons holding 5 or more of the class of interests described in clauses ia or ib above however in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholders stock with “applicable percentage” generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules the applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of us real property interest such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder for these purposes an “applicable investor” is a person other than a qualified shareholder who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10 of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules 

for firpta purposes neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” as defined below nor a “qualified controlled entity” as defined below is treated as a nonus shareholder accordingly the us federal income tax treatment of ordinary dividends received by qualified foreign pension funds and qualified controlled entities will be determined without regard to the firpta rules discussed above and their gain from the sale or exchange of our stock as well as our capital gain dividends and distributions treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock will not be subject to us federal income tax unless such gain is treated as effectively connected with the qualified foreign pension fund’s or the qualified controlled entity’s conduct of a us trade or business a “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement i created or organized in a foreign country ii established to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees including selfemployed individuals or their designees by either a such foreign country as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers or b one or more employers in consideration for services rendered by such employees to such employers iii which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5 of its assets or income iv which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided or is otherwise available to relevant local tax authorities and v with respect to which under its local laws a contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate or b taxation of its investment income is deferred or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate a “qualified controlled entity” for purposes of the above summary means an entity all the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund alternatively under proposed treasury regulations that taxpayers generally may rely on but which are subject to change a “qualified controlled entity” is a trust or corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country all of the interests of which are 

held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds either directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities or partnerships 

in addition the caa clarified that for purposes of determining if a reit is a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” under firpta the presumption that generally a person holding less than 5 of a reit’s class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states for five years has been and will be treated as a us person applies for testing periods ending on or after december 18 2015 eg if a testing period ends on june 1 2018 then the presumption applies for the entire fiveyear period starting on june 1 2013 

the caa also amended numerous code provisions relating to the new rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 to provide that a broader range of partnershiprelated items may be adjusted on audit or in other tax proceedings 

recent fatca regulations 

on december 18 2018 the internal revenue service promulgated proposed treasury regulations under sections 14711474 of the code commonly referred to as fatca which proposed regulations eliminate fatca withholding on gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce us source interest or dividends and thus implicate certain taxrelated disclosures contained in the prospectus while these proposed treasury regulations have not yet been finalized taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed treasury regulations subject to certain limited exceptions as a result the following revisions are made to the prospectus 

 

 

other us federal income tax withholding and reporting requirements fatca the fatca provisions of the code subject to administrative guidance and certain intergovernmental agreements entered into thereunder impose a 30 withholding tax on certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other nonus entities unless i the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or ii the foreign nonfinancial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial united states owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial united states owner if the payee is a foreign financial institution that is not subject to special treatment under certain intergovernmental agreements it must enter into an agreement with the united states treasury department requiring among other things that it undertakes to identify accounts held by certain united states persons or united statesowned foreign entities annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30 on payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting and other requirements investors in jurisdictions that have entered into “intergovernmental agreements” may in lieu of the foregoing requirements be required to report such information to their home jurisdictions the compliance requirements under fatca are complex and special requirements may apply to certain categories of payees 

clarification 

finally the discussion under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmentus taxation of nonus stockholdersdistributions by avalonbay” of the prospectus is clarified to explain that the exception to fiprta for 10 or smaller holders may apply only if our common stock is regularly traded an established securities market located in the united states 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 



 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 48168000  46857000 and 47063000 for 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate as of december 31 2019  capitalized pursuit costs associated with development rights totaled 70486000  

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our direct and indirect investments in real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes during 2019  we settled an aggregate of 250000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2018 in conjunction with the may 2019 unsecured note issuance during 2019  we entered into 350000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2020 which are outstanding as of december 31 2019  in february 2020 in conjunction with the pricing of the 700000000 principal amount of 230 unsecured notes due in 2030 we settled 350000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements 

  

in addition we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had 1026150000 and 1169140000  respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2019 and 2018  our annual interest incurred would have increased by approximately 11221000 and 14963000  respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 7355371000 at december 31 2019 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 7595918000 at december 31 2019  contractual fixed rate debt represented 6675131000 of the fair value at december 31 2019  if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2019  the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 720500000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics we believe that denver colorado and southeast florida share these characteristics and we began investing in these markets in 2017 

at january 31 2019  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm shareholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital we pursue our development redevelopment investment and operating activities with the purpose of creating a better way to live  our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  described in item 2 communities we pursue our development and redevelopment activities primarily through inhouse development and inhouse redevelopment teams which are complemented by our inhouse acquisition platform we believe that our organizational structure which includes dedicated development and operational teams in each of our regions and strong culture are key differentiators providing us with highly talented dedicated and capable associates 

during the three years ended december 31 2018  we acquired 12  apartment communities and disposed of 21  apartment communities excluding unconsolidated investments and the five  whollyowned communities we contributed to the nyc joint venture as defined below during 2018 during the three years ended december 31 2018  we completed the development of 29  apartment communities and the redevelopment of 25  apartment communities 

we have investments in unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interest percentages ranging from 200 to 550 excluding joint ventures formed with equity residential as part of the archstone acquisition during the three years ended december 31 2018  excluding the nyc joint venture we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of 11  communities owned by unconsolidated real estate entities 

during 2018 we contributed five  whollyowned operating communities located in new york ny to a newly formed joint venture the nyc joint venture we retained a 200  interest in the venture and are acting as the managing member of the venture as well as the property manager for the communities the five  communities contain an aggregate of 1301  apartment homes and 58000  square feet of retail space 

on february 27 2013 pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated november 26 2012 the company together with equity residential acquired directly or indirectly all of the assets owned by archstone enterprise lp “archstone” which has since changed its name to jupiter enterprise lp including all of the ownership interests in joint ventures and other entities owned by archstone and assumed archstone’s liabilities both known and unknown with certain limited exceptions under the terms of the purchase agreement the company acquired approximately 400 of archstones assets and liabilities and equity residential acquired approximately 600 of archstone’s assets and liabilities the “archstone acquisition” 

a more detailed description of our unconsolidated real estate entities and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

during 2018  excluding the five  whollyowned operating communities contributed to the nyc joint venture we sold 10  operating communities including sales by unconsolidated entities and recognized a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of 205770000  

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site after the completion of entitlements and shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by undertaking the redevelopment primarily through an occupied turn strategy in which we continue to operate the community as we install improvements in occupied apartment homes working to minimize any impact on our current residents 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when real estate market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other terms of each proposal 

as part of the archstone acquisition in 2013 we acquired and still own 14  assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on the contributed assets our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don’t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the archstone partnership after review and investigation of archstone’s tax and accounting records we estimate that had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2018  with respect to all 14  assets the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately 48300000  at the present time we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income “noi” 

while we have achieved growth in the past through the establishment of discretionary real estate investments funds which placed certain limitations on our ability to acquire new communities during their investments periods we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue expense noi and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes see “tax matters” below 

financing strategy our financing strategy is to endeavor to maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to help ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1500000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2018  we had a total of approximately 681000  square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under development gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2018  was 26071000   11  of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail or forsale residential components of a mixeduse building or project that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a reit with limited exceptions such as those described under “property management strategy” above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net 

income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds other reits and other well capitalized investors to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment construction and operating risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

the construction and maintenance of our communities include a risk of major casualty events that could materially damage our property and the property of others and pose the risk of personal injury while we carry insurance for such risks in amounts we deem reasonable we cannot assure that such insurance will be adequate and when we have incurred and in the future may incur such casualties we are subject to losses on account of deductibles and selfinsured amounts in any event such casualties may also expose us in the future to higher insurance premiums greater construction or operating costs either voluntarily assumed by us or as a result of new local regulations and risks to our reputation among prospective residents or municipalities from which we may seek approvals in the future all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our real estate assets 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

rent control and other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlordtenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

we have seen a recent increase in municipalities implementing considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit our ability to raise rents based solely on market conditions for example in 2016 in mountain view california the voters passed a referendum that limits rent increases on existing tenants but not on new moveins in communities built before 1995 these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs such laws and regulations may limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability for new investments 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing absent changes in other factors our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our available cash will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest on our debt in this regard in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock and efforts to hedge such risk could be ineffective and cause us to incur costs 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

from time to time we use interest rate derivatives to hedge and manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks for example from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to issuance of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges to our earnings in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing and implementing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our 

hedging activities will be effective termination of these hedging agreements may involve net costs such as transaction fees settlement costs andor breakage costs 

bond financing and zoning and other compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning or an agreement relating to property taxes in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2018  52  of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and as a consequence may also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions in addition if we fail to observe these commitments we could lose benefits such as reduced property taxes or face liabilities including liability for the benefits we received under tax exempt bonds or agreements related to property taxes 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to cost effective debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividend received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

we may experience regulatory or economic barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable 

from time to time we dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as “likekind exchanges” under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse tax consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise for example in 2017 we entered the denver colorado and southeast florida markets where we have now engaged and continue to pursue development and acquisition opportunities our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily rental business we also own and lease ancillary retail and commercial space in particular when such tenants represent the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments gross rental revenue provided by leased retailcommercial space in our portfolio represented 11  of our total revenue in 2018 the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases and characteristics of many of our tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity for example we have indicated that we may pursue the sale of residential condominium units as a disposition strategy from the residential component of our development at 15 west 61st street new york new york we may be unsuccessful at developing real estate with the intent to sell or in selling condominiums as a disposition strategy for an asset which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “communities—other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

we are exposed to various risks from our real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring developing or maintaining ownership of apartment communities as a whollyowned investment at times we invest in real estate as a partner or a coventurer with other investors joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds and joint ventures  

we have investment interests in unconsolidated real estate entities collectively ventures ranging from 200  to 550  the ventures present risks including the following 



 

the governance provisions of our joint ventures with equity residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities  

in connection with the archstone acquisition we created joint ventures with equity residential that manage or have an interest in certain of the acquired assets and liabilities these structures involve participation in the ventures by equity residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate including the risk that equity residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures under the form for the joint venture arrangements neither we nor equity residential expect to individually have the sole power to control the ventures and an impasse could occur which could adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology or any noncompliance with applicable laws with respect to the use of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis we also maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches 

however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

various laws and regulations and interpretations thereof as well as agreements with payment processors require or may require us to comply with rules related to our websites for use by residents and prospective residents including requirements related to accessibility of our websites to persons with disabilities and our handling of data collection we could face liabilities for failure to comply with these requirements we could incur costs to comply with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks discussed below 

earthquake risk as further described in item 2 “communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical 

severe or inclement weather risk we are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding severe or inclement weather may result in increased costs resulting from increased maintenance repair of water and wind damage removal of snow and ice and in the case of our development communities delays in construction that result in increased construction costs and delays in realizing rental revenues from a community 

a single catastrophe that affects one of our regions such as an earthquake that affects the west coast or a hurricane or severe winter storm that affects the midatlantic metro new yorknew jersey or new england regions may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

climate change risk to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

terrorism risk  we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc which have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage and that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms and in amounts we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we have acquired although we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we may fail to adequately observe such program or a disturbance of acms may occur nevertheless exposing us to liability 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 

  

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to regular us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our stockholders in addition we hold through our taxable reit subsidiaries certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary or to engage in activities that generate nonqualifying reit income our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to us tax as regular corporations the archstone acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

prospective investors are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the effects of recently enacted tax legislation and other legislative regulatory and administrative developments 

on december 22 2017 hr 1 informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted the tcja made major changes to the code including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their stockholders the longterm effect of the significant changes made by the tcja remains uncertain and additional administrative guidance will be required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions the effect of any technical corrections with respect to the tcja could have an adverse effect on us or our stockholders or holders of our debt securities 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but it is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year the following is a description of each category 

current communities  are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup redevelopment or unconsolidated according to the following attributes 

 

 

 

 

 

development communities  are communities that are either currently under construction or were under construction and completed during the fiscal year these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights  are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest where we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

as of december 31 2018  communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually changes in the established communities portfolios for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



 

 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings of stacked flats andor townhome apartments in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities consisting of larger elevatorserved buildings of four or more stories frequently with structured parking as of january 31 2019  our current communities consisted of the following 



as discussed in item 1 “business” we operate under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint our core “ avalon”  brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services “ ava”  targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus “ eaves by avalon”  is targeted to the cost conscious “value” segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of creating a better way to live  helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 



we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2018  we completed construction of seven  communities containing 1915  apartment homes one of which was developed through an unconsolidated joint venture and sold 10  operating communities containing an aggregate of 2321  apartment homes as well as the five communities contributed to the nyc joint venture the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 192 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 99 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2019  we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

 

 

 

 

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in our development communities as well as a mixeduse project currently being developed in which we are pursuing a potential forsale strategy of individual condominium units 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2019  there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 

development communities 

as of december 31 2018  we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in 21  development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 6609  apartment homes and 87000  square feet of retail space to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 2383000000  additionally we are pursuing a potential forsale strategy of individual condominium units for the residential portion of the 15 west 61st street development which is currently under construction and when completed is expected to contain 172  residential units and 67000  square feet of retail space for a total capitalized cost of 620000000  we currently intend to own and operate the retail portion of the development we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the factors identified under “forwardlooking statements” for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a fee simple ownership interest in these communities directly or through a whollyowned subsidiary unless otherwise noted in the table 



 



 

during the year ended december 31 2018  the company completed the development of the following communities 



 

 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2018  we had nine  communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 177000000  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio in addition during 2018 we completed the reconstruction of the building that was destroyed in the edgewater casualty loss in 2015 the new edgewater building contains 240  apartment homes and was reconstructed for a total capitalized cost of 61000000  excluding costs incurred prior to the start of reconstruction you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 



 

 

development rights 

at december 31 2018  we had 84712000  in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in land parcels we own and 47443000  in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 28  development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2018  includes 74342000  in original land acquisition costs net of any impairment loss recognized the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 9769  apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 21  development rights we control the land through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through conditional agreements or options to acquire land for one  development right we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development in addition six  development rights are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and will be constructed on land currently associated with or adjacent to those operating communities during the next 12 months we expect to commence construction of an apartment community on the development right for which we currently own the land with a carrying basis of 84712000  

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2018  we incurred a charge of 4309000  for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined were no longer probable of being developed 

you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the following presents a summary of the development rights 



 

 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2018  we acquired land parcels for seven  development rights as shown in the table below for an aggregate investment of 140563000  for all of the parcels construction has either started or is expected to start within the next six months 



  

 

disposition activity 

we sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our periods of ownership and we generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2018  to january 31 2019  we sold our interest in nine  whollyowned operating communities containing 1982  apartment homes with an aggregate gross sales price of 688750000  excluding the five  whollyowned operating communities contributed to the nyc joint venture 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies along with other insurance policies we maintain have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses including but not limited to losses arising from nuclear liability or acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or casualty loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault the hayward fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels we procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with a loss limit of 175000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes however for any losses resulting from earthquakes at communities located in california or washington the loss limit is 150000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate the deductible applicable to losses resulting from earthquakes occurring in california is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building subject to a minimum of 100000 and a maximum of 25000000 per loss limits deductibles selfinsured retentions and coverages may increase or decrease annually during the insurance renewal process which occurs on different dates throughout the calendar year 

our communities are insured for certain property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor a master property insurance program which covers the majority of our communities this master property program provides a 400000000 limit for any single occurrence subject to certain sublimits and exclusions under the master property program we are subject to a 100000 deductible per occurrence as well as additional selfinsured retention for the next 350000 of loss per occurrence until the aggregate incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1500000 for the policy year 

our communities are insured for thirdparty liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance program the master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions and they require a selfinsured retention of 500000 per occurrence 

we also maintain certain casualty policies general liability umbrellaexcess and workers compensation for construction related risks which have various exclusions and deductibles that in management’s view are commercially reasonable certain projects are insured through our master insurance policies while others are insured through projectspecific insurance policies the limits vary by project and may be subject to deductibles up to 1500000 per occurrence 

we utilize a whollyowned captive insurance company to insure certain types and amounts of risks which includes property damage and resulting business interruption losses general liability insurance and other construction related liability risks in addition to our potential liability for the various policy selfinsured retentions and deductibles our captive insurance company is directly responsible for i 25 of the first 50000000 of losses per occurrence incurred by the master property insurance policy and ii covered liability claims arising out of our commercial general liability policy subject to a 2000000 per occurrence loss limit the captive is utilized to insure other limited levels of risk which may be in part reinsured by third party insurance 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism our communities are insured for terrorism related losses through the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” program this coverage extends to most of our casualty exposures subject to deductibles and insured limits and certain property insurance policies we have also purchased privatemarket insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of 600000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy and limited cyber liability insurance the crime policies protect us up to 30000000 per occurrence subject to sublimits and exclusions from employee theft of money securities or property the limited cyber liability insurance is part of our professional liability coverage and has limits of 15000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate the cyber liability coverage protects us from certain claims arising out of data breach wrongful acts data privacy issues and media liability 

the amount or types of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover all losses 

maplewood casualty loss 

in february 2017 a fire occurred at avalon maplewood located in maplewood nj maplewood which at the time was under construction and not yet occupied the company completed reconstruction of the damaged and destroyed portions of the community as well as the vertical construction of the community in 2018 in 2017 we reached a final insurance settlement for the property damage and lost income for the maplewood casualty loss of 19696000  after selfinsurance and deductibles of which 3495000  was recognized as business interruption insurance proceeds 

edgewater casualty loss 

in january 2015 a fire occurred at our avalon at edgewater apartment community located in edgewater nj “edgewater” edgewater consisted of two residential buildings one building containing 240 apartment homes was destroyed the second building containing 168 apartment homes suffered minimal damage and has been repaired in january 2016 we reached a final settlement with our property and casualty insurers regarding the property damage and lost income related to the edgewater casualty loss for which we received aggregate insurance proceeds of 73150000  after selfinsurance and deductibles we received 44142000  of these recoveries in 2015 and the remaining 29008000  in 2016 of which 8702000  was recognized as an additional net casualty gain and 20306000  as business interruption insurance proceeds 

in 2017 we commenced the reconstruction of the destroyed building which we completed in 2018 

to date a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us including four  class actions approximately 23 individual actions and subrogation actions by insurers who provided renters insurance to our residents while we can give no assurances we believe that any remaining liability will be covered by third party insurance andor will not have a material impact on our statement of financial position or operations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as discussed immediately above in january 2015 a fire occurred at the companys avalon at edgewater apartment community in edgewater nj the company believes that the fire was caused by sparks from a torch used during repairs being performed by a company employee who was not a licensed plumber the company has since revised its maintenance policies to require that nonflame tools be used for plumbing repairs where possible or where not possible inside the building envelope that a qualified third party vendor perform the work in accordance with the companys policies 

the company has established protocols for processing claims from third parties who suffered losses as a result of the fire and many third parties have contacted the companys insurance carrier and settled their claims through the date of this form 10k of the 229 occupied apartments destroyed in the fire the residents of approximately 95  units have settled claims with the companys insurer through this claims process 

with regard to the building that was destroyed three  class action lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of occupants and consolidated in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the company has agreed with class counsel to the terms of a settlement which provides a claims process with agreed upon protocols for instructing the adjuster as to how to evaluate claims and if needed an arbitration process to determine damage amounts to be paid to individual claimants covered by the class settlement in july 2017 the district court granted final approval of the class action settlement and all claims have been submitted to the independent claims adjuster a total of 66  units consisting of residents who did not previously settle their claims and who did not opt out of the class settlement are included in the class action settlement and bound by its terms however only approximately 45  units submitted claims the independent claims adjuster is currently reviewing the claims submitted the submitted claims total approximately 6900000  but based on the companys review of initial determinations made by the adjuster on a number of claims the company believes that the total amount actually awarded will be significantly less to date the claims adjuster completed its evaluation of 37  of these claims and it is expected that the evaluation of the remaining claims should be completed within the next month in addition to the class action lawsuits described above the company has resolved litigated claims with tenants of approximately 60  units there is currently one remaining resident lawsuit with respect to the destroyed building filed in the superior court of new jersey bergen county  law division the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the extent of damages claimed in that suit a number of subrogation lawsuits had been filed against the company by insurers of edgewater residents who obtained renters insurance these lawsuits have been resolved or are expected to be resolved during the first quarter of 2019 a fourth  class action being heard in the same federal court was filed against the company on behalf of a purported class of residents of the second edgewater building that suffered minimal damage in october 2018 the court certified the class and the case will continue as a class action 

having settled many third party claims as described above while the company can give no assurances the company currently believes that any potential remaining liability to third parties including any potential liability to third parties determined in accordance with the class settlement described above will not be material to the company and will in any event be substantially covered by the companys insurance policies 

the company is involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings unrelated to the edgewater casualty loss that arise in the ordinary course of its business while no assurances can be given the company does not currently believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

business description 

our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets 

we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics we believe that the denver colorado and southeast florida markets share these characteristics and in 2017 we began to invest in these markets through acquisitions and developments we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 

2018 financial highlights 

net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2018  was 974525000  an increase of 97604000  or 111  over the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains and noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities as well as decreases in loss on extinguishment of debt net and casualty and impairment loss these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of unconsolidated communities in various joint ventures and related promote income coupled with increases in depreciation and interest expense 

established communities noi for the year ended december 31 2018  increased by 26248000  or 23  over the prior year the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 25  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 32  over 2017  

during 2018  we raised approximately 1572833000  of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes sale of common shares under cep iv and the sale of consolidated operating communities and other real estate this amount does not include proceeds from joint venture dispositions the funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of eight  operating communities as well as the five communities contributed to the nyc joint venture and one  ancillary land parcel we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2018  we completed the construction of seven  communities containing an aggregate of 1915  apartment homes and 10000  square feet of retail space for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 742000000  or 693000000  when including only our 550 interest in one community developed through an unconsolidated joint venture we also started the construction of eight  communities containing an aggregate of 2154  apartment homes which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 718000000  in addition during 2018  we completed the redevelopment of eight  communities containing an aggregate of 3368  apartment homes for a total investment of 217000000  excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

we also achieved portfolio growth through acquisitions acquiring four  communities containing an aggregate of 1096  apartment homes for an aggregate purchase price of 334450000  

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources existing cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

communities overview 

as of december 31 2018  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 291  apartment communities containing 85158  apartment homes in 12  states and the district of columbia of which 21  communities were under development and nine  communities were under redevelopment of these communities 15  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including five  owned by the us fund five owned by the nyc joint venture and two  owned by the ac jv in addition we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 28  whollyowned communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 9769  apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current communities development communities and development rights our current communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities 

established communities are generally consolidated communities in markets where we have a significant presence that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years other stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the fiscal year leaseup communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the fiscal year unconsolidated communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2018  2017  and 2016  follows dollars in thousands 



 

 

net income attributable to common stockholders  increased 97604000  or 111  to 974525000  in 2018  from 2017  primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains and noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities as well as decreases in loss on extinguishment of debt net and casualty and impairment loss these amounts were partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of unconsolidated communities in various joint ventures and related promote income coupled with increases in depreciation and interest expense net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 157081000  or 152  to 876921000  in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains coupled with increases in depreciation loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year these amounts were partially offset by an increase in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities 

noi  is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management expenses expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries interest expense net loss gain on extinguishment of debt net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities depreciation expense corporate income tax benefit expense casualty and impairment loss gain net gain on sale of communities loss gain on other real estate transactions and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



  

the noi increases for both 2018  and 2017  as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



 

 

the increase in our established communities noi in 2018  and 2017  is due to increased rental rates partially offset by increased operating expenses 

rental and other income  increased in both 2018  and 2017  compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our established communities the changes between years are also impacted by business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the edgewater and maplewood casualty losses as described above 

consolidated communities—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 73385  apartment homes for 2018  as compared to 70081  homes for 2017  and 67849  homes for 2016  the weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2588  for 2018  as compared to 2556  in 2017  and 2476  in 2016  

established communities—rental revenue increased 40526000  or 25  to 1631633000  for 2018  from 1591107000  in the prior year the increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 25  to 2576  per apartment home and maintaining economic occupancy consistent at 961  rental revenue increased 38648000  or 25  for 2017  as compared to the prior year economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in 2018  as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the northern california region accounted for 225  of the established community rental revenue for 2018  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 27  for 2018  over the prior year average rental rates increased 27  to 2936  per apartment home and economic occupancy remained consistent at 964  for 2018  as compared to 2017  we believe improving income growth will support stronger rental revenue growth in northern california in 2019 

the metro new yorknew jersey region accounted for 221  of the established community rental revenue for 2018  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 17  for 2018  over the prior year average rental rates increased 18  to 3002  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 01  decrease in economic occupancy to 962  for 2018  as compared to 2017  we expect operating conditions in the metro new yorknew jersey region to improve modestly in 2019 driven primarily by a stronger income growth forecast than 2018 

the southern california region accounted for 209  of the established community rental revenue for 2018  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 36  for 2018  over the prior year average rental rates increased 35  to 2300  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 01  to 961  for 2018  as compared to 2017  we believe relatively stable job and income growth in southern california will continue to support favorable operating conditions in the region in 2019 

the new england region accounted for 147  of the established community rental revenue for 2018  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 30  for 2018  over the prior year average rental rates increased 29  to 2510  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 01  to 960  for 2018  as compared to 2017  we expect the operating environment in new england to improve in 2019 driven by strengthening income growth and a decrease in the volume of new apartment deliveries relative to 2018 

the midatlantic region accounted for 145  of the established community rental revenue for 2018  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 18  for 2018  over the prior year average rental rates increased 17  to 2218  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 01  to 960  for 2018  as compared to 2017  we believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in the midatlantic region will continue to limit our ability to increase rental rates in 2019 

the pacific northwest region accounted for 53  of the established community rental revenue for 2018  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 25  for 2018  over the prior year average rental rates increased 25  to 2301  per apartment home and economic occupancy remained consistent at 960  for 2018  as compared to 2017  we expect operating conditions in the pacific northwest to remain relatively stable in 2019 

management development and other fees  decreased 575000  or 139  and 1452000  or 259  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the decreases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from fund ii the us fund and the ac jv 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes  increased 12704000  or 30  and 21874000  or 54  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 5993000  or 20  and 6067000  or 20  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2018 was primarily due to increased compensation expense as well as maintenance and utilities costs partially offset by decreased marketing and property insurance costs the increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation expense bad debt and turnover and maintenance costs partially offset by decreased property insurance costs 

property taxes  increased 20188000  or 91  and 16538000  or 81  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2018  and 2017  were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities increased assessments across our portfolio as well as successful appeals in the prior years in excess of those recognized in the then current year 

for established communities property taxes increased 8520000  or 53  and 5300000  or 35  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to increased assessments and rates in the current year periods as well as successful appeals in the prior year periods in the companys west coast markets for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses  increased 10574000  or 152  and 2521000  or 38  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior year the increase in 2018 was primarily due to advocacy contributions not present in the prior year increased compensation related costs and spending on corporate initiatives in the current year the increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs partially offset by severance costs in 2016 not present in 2017 

investments and investment management expense  increased by 1773000  or 299  and 1114000  or 231  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2018 was primarily due to severance costs which were not present in the prior year and an increase in compensation expense the increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense 

expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries  primarily reflect abandoned pursuit costs as well as acquisition costs related to business acquisitions that occurred prior to the adoption of asu 201701 as of october 1 2016 subsequent to the adoption of asu 201701 we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in acquisition costs being capitalized instead of expensed abandoned pursuit costs include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period these aggregate costs increased 1573000  or 575  in 2018  and decreased 7186000  or 724  in 2017  as compared to the prior years the increase in 2018 was primarily due to increased abandoned development pursuit costs and the noncash writeoff of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the us fund and the ac jv the decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in acquisition costs related to communities acquired during the prior year periods that were expensed prior to the adoption of asu 201701 decreased development pursuit costs as well as the noncash writeoff of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the us fund in the prior year period in excess of amounts recognized in the current year period 

interest expense net  increased 21313000  or 107  and 12151000  or 65  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years this category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity amortization of premiumdiscount on debt and interest income the increase in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized resulting from a decrease in development and redevelopment activity as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness partially offset by a decrease in secured indebtedness the increase in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized resulting from a decrease in development activity as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness 

loss on the extinguishment of debt net  reflects   prepayment penalties the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired the loss of 17492000  for 2018 was due to 

 

 

the loss of 25472000  for 2017 was primarily due to 

 

 

depreciation expense  increased 47046000  or 81  and 52716000  or 99  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

general and administrative expense  “ga” increased 5692000  or 112  and 4902000  or 107  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses and a decrease in legal recoveries the increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses professional fees and sales and use tax expense 

casualty and impairment loss gain net of 215000  for 2018 primarily consists of an impairment charge of 826000  recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development and no longer intend to develop partially offset by 554000  of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the archstone acquisition the loss of 6250000  for 2017 consists of a 9350000  impairment charge recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development in 2004 and sold in july 2017 and the net impact of the maplewood casualty loss net of associated insurance receivables of 2338000  partially offset by 5438000  of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the archstone acquisition 

equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities  decreased 55474000  or 784  and increased 5782000  or 89  in 2018  and 2017  respectively as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to gains on the sale of communities in various ventures and the recognition of income for the companys promoted interest from fund ii in the prior year period coupled with the resulting decreased noi from the ventures in the current year period due to disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 the increase in 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of income for the companys promoted interest partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of communities in various ventures in the current year and decreased noi from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 

gain on sale of communities  increased in 2018  and decreased in 2017  as compared to the prior years the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area the gain of 374976000  in 2018 was primarily due to the sale of eight  whollyowned operating communities and the recognition of the gain associated with the contribution of five whollyowned operating communities to the nyc joint venture a venture in which we retained a 200 interest the gain of 252599000  in 2017 was primarily due to the sale of six whollyowned operating communities 

gain loss on other real estate transactions  of 345000  in 2018 was primarily composed of gains on ancillary real estate the loss of 10907000  in 2017 was primarily composed of the noncash writeoff of prepaid rent associated with the purchase of land previously subject to a ground lease 

liquidity and capital resources 

we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management when we source capital we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 217864000  at december 31 2018  an increase of 15958000  from 201906000  at december 31 2017  the following discussion relates to changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 1301111000  in 2018  from 1256257000  in 2017  the change was driven primarily by increased noi from existing acquired and newly developed communities 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities totaled 596651000  in 2018  the net cash used was primarily due to 



 

these amounts are partially offset by 

 

financing activities—net cash used in financing activities totaled 688502000  in 2018  the net cash used was primarily due to 

 

these amounts are partially offset by 

 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we have a 1500000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility which matures in april 2020 we may extend the maturity for up to nine months provided we are not in default and upon payment of a 1500000 extension fee the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 0825  per annum  334  at january 31 2019  assuming a one month borrowing rate the annual facility fee is 0125  or approximately 1875000  annually based on the 1500000000  facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we had 106000000  outstanding under the credit facility and had 40010000  outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2019  

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility the term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2018  

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured

in december 2015 we commenced a fourth continuous equity program “cep iv” under which we may sell up to 1000000000  of our common stock from time to time actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep iv we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 20  of the gross sales price for shares sold cep iv also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to 1000000000  in aggregate sales price of our common stock we expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement in connection with each forward sale agreement we will pay the relevant forward seller in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price commission of up to 20  of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold in 2018  we sold 244924  shares at an average sales price of 18914  per share for net proceeds of 45629000  as of january 31 2019  we had 846591000  of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program and no forward sales agreements outstanding 

forward interest rate swap agreements 

in 2018  we entered into 250000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2019 which are outstanding as of december 31 2018  at maturity of the outstanding swap agreements we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value assuming that we issue the debt as expected the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment 

in conjunction with our march 2018 unsecured note issuance we settled 300000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2017 and designated as cash flow hedges of interest variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes receiving a payment of 12598000  

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following debt activity occurred during 2018  

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  dollars in thousands we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest 





 

 

future financing and capital needs—portfolio and capital markets activity 

in 2019  we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including i real estate dispositions ii cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities iii borrowing capacity under our credit facility and iv secured and unsecured debt financings additional sources of liquidity in 2019  may include the issuance of common and preferred equity our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects 

before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop redevelop or acquire the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

during 2018 we contributed five whollyowned operating communities located in new york ny to a newly formed joint venture the nyc joint venture for net cash proceeds of 276799000  and the assumption of 395939000  of secured indebtedness by the venture recognizing a gain on sale of 179861000  we retained a 200  interest in the venture and are acting as the managing member of the venture as well as the property manager for the communities the five  communities contain an aggregate of 1301  apartment homes and 58000  square feet of retail space in conjunction with the formation of the venture we entered into the refinancing and borrowing activities discussed in liquidity and capital resources future financing and capital needs—debt maturities and the venture assumed all outstanding indebtedness 

the us fund has six  institutional investors including us we are the general partner of the us fund and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the us fund we have an equity investment of 31194000  net of distributions representing a 286  combined equity interest the us fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested the us fund has a term that expires in july 2023 assuming the exercise of two oneyear extension options during 2018  the us fund sold one  community containing 131  apartment homes for a sales price of 85500000  our share of the gain was 8636000  in conjunction with the disposition of this community the us fund repaid 27928000  of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity date 

the ac jv has four  institutional investors including us excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the ac jv we have an equity investment of 34799000  net of distributions representing a 200  equity interest the ac jv was formed in 2011 during 2018  the ac jv sold one  community containing 392  apartment homes for a sales price of 94250000  our proportionate share of the gain in accordance with gaap was 2019000  in conjunction with the disposition of this community the ac jv repaid a 50647000  loan to the equity investors in the venture at par 

during 2016 we entered into a joint venture to develop own and operate ava north point an apartment community located in cambridge ma which completed construction during 2018 and contains 265  apartment homes we own a 550  interest in the venture and the venture partner owns the remaining 450  interest ava north point is the third phase of a master planned development the other phases of which are owned through the ac jv during 2016 we provided the partners of the ac jv the opportunity to acquire the ava north point land parcel we owned as required in the right of first offer “rofo” provisions for the ac jv after certain partners of the ac jv declined to participate we entered into the new joint venture and sold the land parcel to the venture in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit and managed the development of ava north point in exchange for a developer fee upon sale of the land parcel we recognized a gain of 10621000  at december 31 2018  excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of ava north point we have an equity investment of 45162000  

during 2015 we entered into a joint venture agreement to purchase land and pursue entitlements and predevelopment activity for a mixeduse development project in sudbury ma including multifamily apartment homes retail senior housing and agerestricted housing we have a 600  ownership interest in the venture during 2017 we and our joint venture partner each acquired our respective portions of the real estate held by the venture with our portion consisting of a parcel of land on which we are developing an apartment community acquired for an investment of 19200000  along with our joint venture partner we retained continuing involvement with the venture to fund the completion of the planned infrastructure and site work which is substantially complete as of december 31 2018  

as part of the archstone acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with equity residential through which we assumed obligations of archstone in the form of preferred interests some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements the “legacy jv” we have a 400  interest in the legacy jv during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  the legacy jv redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends of which our portion was 1120000  2000000  and 1960000  respectively at december 31 2018  the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of 36806000  our 400  share of which was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets presented elsewhere in this report 

in conjunction with the archstone acquisition through subsidiaries we entered into three limited liability company agreements with equity residential collectively the “residual jv” through which we and equity residential acquired i certain assets of archstone that we and equity residential have divested the “residual assets” and ii various liabilities of archstone that we and equity residential agreed to assume the “residual liabilities” the residual assets included various licenses insurance policies contracts office leases and other miscellaneous assets the residual liabilities include most existing or future litigation and claims related to archstone’s operations for periods before the close of the archstone acquisition except for i claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by us or equity residential which generally remain the sole responsibility of us or equity residential as applicable and ii certain tax and other litigation between archstone and various equity holders in archstone related to periods before the close of the archstone acquisition and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of archstone that occurred prior to closing for which the seller has agreed to indemnify us and equity residential we jointly control the residual jv with equity residential and we hold a 400 economic interest in the residual jv we believe our remaining potential obligations under the residual jv will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in addition during 2018 we held an investment in and received the final distributions for fund ii fund ii was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds and iii additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund ii had six institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries was the general partner of fund ii and we had an equity interest of 313  combined general partner and limited partner equity interest upon achievement of a threshold return we had a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest which represented the first 400  of further fund ii distributions which was in addition to our share of the remaining 600  of distributions fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in august 2011 in 2017 fund ii sold its final apartment communities and we completed the dissolution of fund ii in 2018 

as of december 31 2018  we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting refer to note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results for ventures holding operating apartment communities as of december 31 2018  detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table dollars in thousands 



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities as referenced in the table above nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so in the future in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support or take any other action as any such action would depend on a variety of factors including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities andor our returns by providing time for performance to improve 

there are no other material lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest 

contractual obligations 

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2018  dollars in thousands 



 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

recent us federal income tax updates 

this summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice this discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances 

the following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment” in the prospectus dated february 23 2018 contained in our registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on february 23 2018 

consolidated appropriations act updates 

on march 23 2018 the consolidated appropriations act 2018 the “caa” was enacted the caa amended various provisions of the code and implicate certain taxrelated disclosures contained in the prospectus as a result the discussion under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmentus taxation of nonus stockholdersspecial firpta rules” of the prospectus is replaced with the following paragraphs 

special firpta rules  to the extent our stock is held directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships by a “qualified shareholder” it will not be treated as a us real property interest for such qualified shareholder further to the extent such treatment applies any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest for these purposes a qualified shareholder is generally a nonus stockholder that ia is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the united states that includes an exchange of information program and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty or b is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the united states and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units having a value greater than 50 of the value of all partnership units on the new york stock exchange or nasdaq ii is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” within the meaning of section 897k3b of the code and iii maintains records of persons holding 5 or more of the class of interests described in clauses ia or ib above however in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholders stock with “applicable percentage” generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules the applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of us real property interest such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder for these purposes an “applicable investor” is a person other than a qualified shareholder who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10 of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules 

for firpta purposes a “qualified foreign pension fund” shall not be treated as a nonus stockholder and any entity all of the interests of which are held by an qualified foreign pension fund shall be treated as such a fund a qualified foreign pension fund is an organization or arrangement i created or organized in a foreign country ii established to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees including selfemployed individuals or their designees by either a a foreign country as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers or b one or more employers in consideration for services rendered by such employees to such employers iii which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5 of its assets or income iv which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided or is otherwise available to relevant local tax authorities and v with respect to which under its local laws a contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate or b taxation of its investment income is deferred or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate 

in addition the caa clarified that for purposes of determining if a reit is a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” under firpta the presumption that generally a person holding less than 5 of a reit’s class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states for five years has been and will be treated as a us person applies for testing periods ending on or after december 18 2015 eg if a testing period ends on june 1 2018 then the presumption applies for the entire fiveyear period starting on june 1 2013 

the caa also amended numerous code provisions relating to the new rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 to provide that a broader range of partnershiprelated items may be adjusted on audit or in other tax proceedings 

recent fatca regulations 

on december 18 2018 the internal revenue service promulgated proposed treasury regulations under sections 14711474 of the code commonly referred to as fatca which proposed regulations eliminate fatca withholding on gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce us source interest or dividends and thus implicate certain taxrelated disclosures contained in the prospectus while these proposed treasury regulations have not yet been finalized taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed treasury regulations subject to certain limited exceptions as a result the following revisions are made to the prospectus 

 

 

other us federal income tax withholding and reporting requirements fatca  the fatca provisions of the code subject to administrative guidance and certain intergovernmental agreements entered into thereunder impose a 30 withholding tax on certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other nonus entities unless i the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or ii the foreign nonfinancial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial united states owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial united states owner if the payee is a foreign financial institution that is not subject to special treatment under certain intergovernmental agreements it must enter into an agreement with the united states treasury department requiring among other things that it undertakes to identify accounts held by certain united states persons or united statesowned foreign entities annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30 on payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting and other requirements investors in jurisdictions that have entered into “intergovernmental agreements” may in lieu of the foregoing requirements be required to report such information to their home jurisdictions the compliance requirements under fatca are complex and special requirements may apply to certain categories of payees 

clarification 

finally the discussion under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmentus taxation of nonus stockholdersdistributions by avalonbay” of the prospectus is clarified to explain that the exception to fiprta for 10 or smaller holders may apply only if our common stock is regularly traded an established securities market located in the united states 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements 

to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2018  our assets would have increased by 1247749000  and our liabilities would have increased by 741282000  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 46857000  47063000  and 45201000  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate as of december 31 2018  capitalized pursuit costs associated with development rights totaled 47443000  

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a reit is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on our taxable income if we annually distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to regular federal and state corporate income taxes and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2018  our net income would have decreased by approximately 266240000  

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 

acquisition of investments in real estate 

we assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes during 2018  we entered into 250000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2019 during 2018  we settled an aggregate of 300000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2017 in conjunction with the march 2018 unsecured note issuance in addition we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had 1169140000  and 1460326000  respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2018  and 2017  our annual interest incurred would have increased by approximately 14963000  and 14867000  respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 7102355000  at december 31 2018  had an estimated aggregate fair value of 6774153000  at december 31 2018  contractual fixed rate debt represented 5779167000  of the fair value at december 31 2018  if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2018  the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 240633000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics 

at january 31 2018  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm shareholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital we pursue our development redevelopment investment and operating activities with the purpose of creating a better way to live  our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  described in item 2 communities we pursue our development and redevelopment activities primarily through inhouse development and inhouse redevelopment teams which are complemented by our inhouse acquisition platform we believe that our organizational structure which includes dedicated development and operational teams in each of our regions and strong culture are key differentiators providing us with highly talented dedicated and capable associates 

during the three years ended december 31 2017  we acquired eight  apartment communities and disposed of 16  apartment communities excluding activity for unconsolidated investments inclusive of the funds as defined below during the three years ended december 31 2017  we completed the development of 35  apartment communities and the redevelopment of 21  apartment communities 

on february 27 2013 pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated november 26 2012 the company together with equity residential acquired directly or indirectly all of the assets owned by archstone enterprise lp “archstone” which has since changed its name to jupiter enterprise lp including all of the ownership interests in joint ventures and other entities owned by archstone and assumed archstone’s liabilities both known and unknown with certain limited exceptions under the terms of the purchase agreement the company acquired approximately 400 of archstones assets and liabilities and equity residential acquired approximately 600 of archstone’s assets and liabilities the “archstone acquisition” 

in march 2005 we formed avalonbay value added fund lp “fund i” a private discretionary real estate investment vehicle which we managed and in which we owned a 152  interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in 2005 through the close of its investment period in 2008 fund i acquired 20  communities fund i disposed of the last of its communities in 2014 and was dissolved in 2015 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp “fund ii” a second private discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 313  interest from the commencement of fund ii in 2008 through the close of its investment period in 2011 fund ii acquired 13  operating communities during the three years ended december 31 2017  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of 10  communities owned by fund ii during 2017  fund ii sold its final apartment communities and we expect to complete the dissolution of fund ii in 2018 

in conjunction with the archstone acquisition through subsidiaries we acquired and own the general partner interest and hold a 286  interest in the us fund the us fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested as of december 31 2017  the us fund owns six  communities containing 1077  apartment homes one of which includes a marina containing 229  boat slips during the three years ended december 31 2017  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of three  communities owned by the us fund 

in conjunction with the archstone acquisition through subsidiaries we acquired a 200  ownership interest in archstone multifamily partners ac jv lp the “ac jv” the ac jv is a joint venture that was formed in 2011 and as of december 31 2017  owns three  operating apartment communities containing 921  apartment homes the ac jv partnership agreement contains provisions that require us to provide a right of first offer “rofo” to the ac jv in connection with additional opportunities to acquire or develop additional interests in multifamily real estate assets within a specified geographic radius of the existing assets generally one mile or less the rofo restriction expires in 2019 

a more detailed description of fund ii and the us fund collectively the “funds” the ac jv and other joint ventures and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in conjunction with the archstone acquisition through subsidiaries we entered into three limited liability company agreements with equity residential collectively the “residual jv” through which we and equity residential acquired i certain assets of archstone that we and equity residential have substantially divested the “residual assets” and ii various liabilities of archstone that we and equity residential agreed to assume the “residual liabilities” the residual assets included a 200 interest in lake mendota investments llc and subsidiaries “swib” a joint venture which disposed of the last of its communities in 2015 various licenses insurance policies contracts office leases and other miscellaneous assets the residual liabilities include most existing or future litigation and claims related to archstone’s operations for periods before the close of the archstone acquisition except for i claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by us or equity residential which generally remain the sole responsibility of us or equity residential as applicable and ii certain tax and other litigation between archstone and various equity holders in archstone related to periods before the close of the archstone acquisition and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of archstone that occurred prior to closing for which the seller has agreed to indemnify us and equity residential we jointly control the residual jv with equity residential and we hold a 400 economic interest in the residual jv 

during 2017  we sold 10  operating communities including sales by unconsolidated entities and recognized a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of  291273000  

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site after the completion of entitlements and shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by undertaking the redevelopment primarily through an occupied turn strategy in which we continue to operate the community as we install improvements and frequently install improvements in occupied apartment homes working to minimize any impact on our current residents 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when real estate market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other terms of each proposal 

as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired and still own 14  assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on the contributed assets our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don’t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the archstone partnership after review and investigation of archstone’s tax and accounting records we estimate that had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2017  with respect to all 14  assets the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately 50600000  at the present time we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income “noi” 

while we have achieved growth in the past through the establishment of discretionary real estate investments funds which placed certain limitations on our ability to acquire new communities during their investments periods we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue expense noi and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes see “tax matters” below 

financing strategy our financing strategy is to endeavor to maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to help ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1500000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2017  we had a total of 771288  square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under development gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2017  was 29137000   13  of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail or forsale residential components of a mixeduse building or project that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a reit with limited exceptions such as those described under “property management strategy” above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds other reits and other well capitalized investors to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment construction and operating risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

the construction and maintenance of our communities includes a risk of major casualty events that could materially damage our property and the property of others and pose the risk of personal injury while we carry insurance for such risks in amounts we deem reasonable we cannot assure that such insurance will be adequate and when we have incurred and in the future may incur such casualties we are subject to losses on account of deductibles and selfinsured amounts in any event such casualties may also expose us in the future to higher insurance premiums greater construction or operating costs either voluntarily assumed by us or as a result of new local regulations and risks to our reputation among prospective residents or municipalities from which we may seek approvals in the future all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our real estate assets 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

rent control and other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlordtenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

we have seen a recent increase in municipalities considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents based solely on market conditions depending on the nature of such laws or regulations and the number of our communities that become subject to any such restriction on rent increases our revenues and net income could be adversely affected for example in 2016 in mountain view california the voters passed a referendum that limits rent increases on existing tenants but not on new moveins in communities built before 1995 we have three  communities with a total of 946  apartment homes that are subject to the new law we are aware of efforts in other municipalities to enact similar controls as well as an effort in california to overturn a state law that currently limits municipal rent control in that state to i apartments built before 1995 and ii renewal increases in rent not new tenancies upon a vacancy 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability for new investments 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing absent changes in other factors our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our available cash will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest on our debt in this regard in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2017  59  of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these 

commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and as a consequence may also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

the mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to cost effective debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividend received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

we may experience regulatory or economic barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily business we also own and lease ancillary retail space when retail represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “communities—other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

we are exposed to various risks from our real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities as a whollyowned investment at times we may invest in real estate as a partner or a coventurer with other investors joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds and joint ventures  

we have investment interests in the funds and joint ventures collectively the ventures ranging from 200  to 550  the ventures present risks including the following 

 

the governance provisions of our joint ventures with equity residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities  

in connection with the archstone acquisition we created joint ventures with equity residential that manage or have an interest in certain of the acquired assets and liabilities these structures involve participation in the ventures by equity residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate including the risk that equity residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures under the form for the joint venture arrangements neither we nor equity residential expect to individually have the sole power to control the ventures and an impasse could occur which could adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis we also maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches 

however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks 

or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks discussed below 

earthquake risk as further described in item 2 “communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical 

severe or inclement weather risk particularly in new england and the metro new yorknew jersey area we are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding severe or inclement weather may result in increased costs resulting from increased maintenance repair of water and wind damage removal of snow and ice and in the case of our development communities delays in construction that result in increased construction costs and delays in realizing rental revenues from a community 

a single catastrophe that affects one of our regions such as an earthquake that affects the west coast or a hurricane or severe winter storm that affects the midatlantic metro new yorknew jersey or new england regions may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

climate change risk   to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

terrorism risk   we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc which markets have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage and that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms and in amounts we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in the companys view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we have acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 

  

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to regular us federal corporate income tax on our taxable income in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our stockholders in addition we may hold through our taxable reit subsidiaries certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly we also may use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to us tax as regular corporations the archstone acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

legislative or regulatory action related to federal income tax laws could adversely affect our stockholders holders of debt securities andor our business 

on december 22 2017 hr 1 informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted the tcja makes major changes to the code including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their stockholders among the changes made by the tcja are i permanently reducing the generally applicable corporate tax rate ii generally reducing the tax rate applicable to individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 iii eliminating or modifying certain previously allowed deductions including substantially limiting interest deductibility and for individuals the deduction for nonbusiness state and local taxes and iv for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 providing for preferential rates of taxation through a deduction of up to 20 subject to certain limitations on most ordinary reit dividends and certain trade or business income of noncorporate taxpayers the tcja also imposes new limitations on the deduction of net operating losses which may result in us having to make additional 

taxable distributions to our stockholders in order to comply with reit distribution requirements or avoid taxes on retained income and gains the effect of the significant changes made by the tcja is highly uncertain and administrative guidance will be required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions the effect of any technical corrections with respect to the tcja could have an adverse effect on us or our stockholders or holders of our debt securities investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the tcja on their investment in our common stock preferred stock or debt securities 

in addition in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder we cannot assure you that future changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our common stock 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but it is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year the following is a description of each category 

current communities  are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup redevelopment or unconsolidated according to the following attributes 

 

 

 

 

 

development communities  are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights  are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest where we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

as of december 31 2017  communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually changes in the established communities portfolios for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



 

 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings of stacked flats andor townhome apartments in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities consisting of larger elevatorserved buildings of four or more stories frequently with structured parking as of january 31 2018  our current communities consisted of the following 



as discussed in item 1 “business” we operate under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint our core “ avalon”  brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services “ ava”  targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus “ eaves by avalon”  is targeted to the cost conscious “value” segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of creating a better way to live  helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 



we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2017  we completed construction of 14  communities containing 5189  apartment homes and sold 10  operating communities containing an aggregate of 3182  apartment homes the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 187 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 115 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2018  we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

 

 

 

 

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 20  of the 21  development communities one development community is being developed within a joint venture 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2018  there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 

development communities 

as of december 31 2017  we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in 21  development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 6544  apartment homes and 97000  square feet of retail space to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 2979000000  we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the factors identified under “forwardlooking statements” for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a fee simple ownership interest in these communities directly or through a whollyowned subsidiary unless otherwise noted in the table 



 



 

during the year ended december 31 2017  the company completed the development of the following communities 



 

 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2017  we had nine  communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 269000000  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 



 

 

development rights 

at december 31 2017  we had 68364000  in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in land parcels we own and 45819000  in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 29  development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2017  includes 48446000  in original land acquisition costs the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 9496  apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 23  development rights we control the land through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through conditional agreements or options to acquire land for four  development rights we either currently own the land have an ownership interest in a joint venture that owns the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development in addition two  development rights are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and will be constructed on land currently associated with those operating communities during the next 12 months we expect to commence construction of apartment communities on the four  development rights for which we currently own the land with a carrying basis of 68364000  

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2017  we incurred a charge of 2736000  for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined were no longer probable of being developed 

you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the following presents a summary of the development rights 



 

 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2017  we acquired land parcels for six  development rights as shown in the table below for an aggregate investment of 83738000  for all of the parcels construction has either started or is expected to start within the next six months 



  

 

other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of 13640000  which we do not currently plan to develop these parcels consist of both ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop and land parcels we acquired for development and now intend to sell during 2017  we recognized an impairment charge of 9350000  for one land parcel that we did not plan to develop and sold in july 2017 we believe that the current carrying value for all other land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are future indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

disposition activity 

we sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our periods of ownership and we generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2017  to january 31 2018  we sold our interest in six  whollyowned communities containing 1624  apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 475500000

we maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies along with other insurance policies we maintain have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses including but not limited to losses arising from nuclear liability or acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or casualty loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault the hayward fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels we procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with a loss limit of 175000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes however for communities located in california or washington the loss limit is 150000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes the deductible applicable to losses resulting from earthquakes occurring in california is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building subject to a minimum of 100000 and a maximum of 25000000 per loss limits deductibles selfinsured retentions and coverages may increase or decrease annually during the insurance renewal process which occurs on different dates throughout the calendar year 

our communities are insured for certain property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor a master property insurance program which covers the majority of our communities this master property program provides a 400000000 limit for any single occurrence subject to certain sublimits and exclusions under the master property program we are subject to a 100000 deductible per occurrence as well as additional selfinsured retention for the next 350000 of loss per occurrence until the aggregate incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1500000 for the policy year 

our communities are insured for thirdparty liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance program the master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions and they require a selfinsured retention of 500000 per occurrence 

we also maintain certain casualty policies general liability umbrellaexcess and workers compensation for construction related risks which have various exclusions and deductibles that in management’s view are commercially reasonable certain projects are insured through our master insurance policies while others are insured through projectspecific insurance policies the limits vary by project and may be subject to deductibles up to 1500000 per occurrence 

we utilize a whollyowned captive insurance company to insure certain types and amounts of risks which includes property damage and resulting business interruption losses general liability insurance and other construction related liability risks in addition to our potential liability for the various policy selfinsured retentions and deductibles our captive insurance company is directly responsible for i 25 of the first 50000000 of losses per occurrence incurred by the master property insurance policy and ii covered liability claims arising out of our commercial general liability policy subject to a 2000000 per occurrence loss limit the captive is utilized to insure other limited levels of risk which may be in part reinsured by third party insurance 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism our communities are insured for terrorism related losses through the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” program this coverage extends to most of our casualty exposures subject to deductibles and insured limits and certain property insurance policies we have also purchased privatemarket insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of 600000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy and limited cyber liability insurance the crime policies protect us up to 30000000 per occurrence subject to sublimits and exclusions from employee theft of money securities or property the limited cyber liability insurance is part of our professional liability coverage and has limits of 15000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate the cyber liability coverage protects us from certain claims arising out of data breach wrongful acts data privacy issues and media liability 

the amount or types of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover all losses 

maplewood casualty loss 

in february 2017 a fire occurred at our avalon maplewood development community located in maplewood nj maplewood which was under construction and not yet occupied we believe that liabilities to third parties resulting from the fire will not be material and will in any event be substantially covered by insurance subject to a deductible the company has commenced reconstruction of the damaged and destroyed portions of the community in 2017 we reached a final insurance settlement for the property damage and lost income for the maplewood casualty loss of 19696000  after selfinsurance and deductibles of which 3495000  was recognized as business interruption insurance proceeds 

edgewater casualty loss 

in january 2015 a fire occurred at our avalon at edgewater apartment community located in edgewater nj “edgewater” edgewater consisted of two residential buildings one building containing 240 apartment homes was destroyed the second building containing 168 apartment homes suffered minimal damage and has been repaired in january 2016 we reached a final settlement with our property and casualty insurers regarding the property damage and lost income related to the edgewater casualty loss for which we received aggregate insurance proceeds of 73150000  after selfinsurance and deductibles we received 44142000  of these recoveries in 2015 and the remaining 29008000  in 2016 of which 8702000  was recognized as an additional net casualty gain and 20306000  as business interruption insurance proceeds 

in 2017 we commenced the reconstruction of the destroyed building which we expect to complete in 2019 

to date a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us including three  class actions approximately 20 individual actions and subrogation actions by insurers who provided renters insurance to our residents having incurred applicable deductibles we currently believe that all of our remaining liability to third parties will not be material and will in any event be substantially covered by our insurance policies however we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter see item 3  legal proceedings below 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as discussed immediately above in january 2015 a fire occurred at the companys avalon at edgewater apartment community in edgewater nj the company believes that the fire was caused by sparks from a torch used during repairs being performed by a company employee who was not a licensed plumber the company has since revised its maintenance policies to require that nonflame tools be used for plumbing repairs where possible or where not possible inside the building envelope that a qualified third party vendor perform the work in accordance with the companys policies 

the company has established protocols for processing claims from third parties who suffered losses as a result of the fire and many third parties have contacted the companys insurance carrier and settled their claims through the date of this form 10k of the 229 occupied apartments destroyed in the fire the residents of approximately 95  units have settled claims with the companys insurer through this claims process 

three  class action lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of occupants of the destroyed building and consolidated in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the company has agreed with class counsel to the terms of a settlement which provides a claims process with agreed upon protocols for instructing the adjuster as to how to evaluate claims and if needed an arbitration process to determine damage amounts to be paid to individual claimants covered by the class settlement in july 2017 the district court granted final approval of the class action settlement and all claims have been submitted to the independent claims adjuster a total of 66  units consisting of residents who did not previously settle their claims and who did not opt out of the class settlement are included in the class action settlement and bound by its terms however only 44  units submitted claims the independent claims adjuster is currently reviewing the claims submitted which total approximately 6900000  to date this claims adjuster has issued awards of behalf of three  units and it is expected that the remaining awards should be determined and issued within the next two months a fourth  class action being heard in the same federal court was filed against the company on behalf of residents of the second edgewater building that suffered minimal damage in addition to the class action lawsuits described above 19  lawsuits representing approximately 143  individual plaintiffs filed in the superior court of new jersey bergen county  law division were previously scheduled for trial on january 2 2018 in advance of this date the company was able to resolve all of these claims in principle which included approximately 50  units the company previously resolved litigated claims with another 10  units there is currently one  remaining lawsuit which was recently filed in the superior court of new jersey bergen county  law division on behalf of one  apartment unit the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the extent of damages claimed in that suit there are also seven  subrogation lawsuits that have been filed against the company by insurers of edgewater residents who obtained renters insurance it is the companys position that in the majority of the applicable leases the residents waived subrogation rights one  of these lawsuits has been dismissed on that basis one  is pending in the superior court of new jersey bergen county  law division one  has been amicably resolved in principle and the other four  have been consolidated and are currently pending in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the district court denied the companys motions seeking dismissal on this basis the company will reassess the viability of this defense after conducting additional discovery 

having settled many third party claims through the insurance claims process the company currently believes that any potential remaining liability to third parties including any potential liability to third parties determined in accordance with the class settlement described above will not be material to the company and will in any event be substantially covered by the companys insurance policies however the company can give no assurances in this regard and continues to evaluate this matter 

the company is involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings unrelated to the edgewater casualty loss that arise in the ordinary course of its business while no assurances can be given the company does not currently believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

business description 

our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets 

we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics we believe that the denver colorado and southeast florida markets share these characteristics and we are pursuing opportunities to invest in these markets through acquisitions and developments having acquired one operating community in each of these markets in 2017 we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 

financial highlights 

for the year ended december 31 2017  net income attributable to common stockholders was 876921000  a decrease of 157081000  or 152  from the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains coupled with increases in depreciation loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year these amounts were partially offset by an increase in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities 

for the year ended december 31 2017  established communities noi increased by 27191000  or 25  over the prior year the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 25  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 25  over 2016  

during 2017  we raised approximately 2320132000  of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes sale of common shares under cep iv and the sale of real estate this amount does not include proceeds from joint venture dispositions and secured debt associated with the refinancing of existing secured indebtedness the funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of six  operating communities three  undeveloped land parcels and other real estate we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2017  we completed the construction of 14  communities containing an aggregate of 5189  apartment homes and 71000  square feet of retail space for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 1897000000  we also started the construction of eight  communities containing an aggregate of 2600  apartment homes which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 808000000  in addition during 2017  we completed the redevelopment of seven  communities containing an aggregate of 2072  apartment homes for a total investment of 99000000  excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we sold six  whollyowned operating communities containing an aggregate of 1624  apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of 475500000  we also sold other ancillary real estate including undeveloped land parcels and 421a tax certificates representing the right to qualify for certain property tax exemptions in new york city for an aggregate sales price 39154000  we recorded an aggregate gain in accordance with gaap of 252845000  associated with our real estate disposition activity 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we acquired three  communities containing an aggregate of 1062  apartment homes and 27000  square feet of retail space for an aggregate purchase price of 365750000  

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources existing cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

communities overview 

as of december 31 2017  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 288  apartment communities containing 84158  apartment homes in 12  states and the district of columbia of which 21  communities were under development and nine  communities were under redevelopment of these communities 12  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including six  owned by the us fund three  owned by the ac jv and one  that is being developed within a joint venture in addition we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 29  whollyowned communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 9496  apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current communities development communities and development rights our current communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities 

established communities are generally consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years other stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the current year leaseup communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year unconsolidated communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2017  2016  and 2015  follows dollars in thousands 



 

 

net income attributable to common stockholders  decreased 157081000  or 152  to 876921000  in 2017  from 2016  primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains coupled with increases in depreciation loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year these amounts were partially offset by an increase in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities net income attributable to common stockholders increased 291964000  or 393  to 1034002000  in 2016  from 2015  primarily due to an increase in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains these amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year 

noi  is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management expenses expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries interest expense net loss gain on extinguishment of debt net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities depreciation expense corporate income tax expense casualty and impairment loss gain net gain on sale of communities loss gain on other real estate transactions and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



  

the noi increases for both 2017  and 2016  as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



 

 

the increase in our established communities noi in 2017  and 2016  is due to increased rental rates partially offset by increased operating expenses the increase in 2016 is also partially offset by decreased economic occupancy 

rental and other income  increased in both 2017  and 2016  compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our established communities the changes between years are also impacted by business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the edgewater and maplewood casualty losses as described above 

consolidated communities—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 70081  apartment homes for 2017  as compared to 67849  homes for 2016  and 64211  homes for 2015  the weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2556  for 2017  as compared to 2476  in 2016  and 2388  in 2015  

established communities—rental revenue increased 38648000  or 25  to 1574395000  for 2017  from 1535747000  in the prior year the increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 24  to 2511  per apartment home and an increase in economic occupancy of 01  to 955  rental revenue increased 64206000  or 43  for 2016  as compared to the prior year economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in 2017  as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region accounted for approximately 230  of the established community rental revenue for 2017  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 21  for 2017  over the prior year average rental rates increased 20  to 3038  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 01  to 958  for 2017  as compared to 2016  we expect operating conditions in the metro new yorknew jersey region to remain bifurcated between new york city and surrounding suburban submarkets in 2018 we believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in new york city are limiting our ability to increase rental rates while surrounding suburban submarkets are more insulated from this new competition 

the southern california region accounted for approximately 215  of the established community rental revenue for 2017  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 39  for 2017  over the prior year average rental rates increased 41  to 2214  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 02  decrease in economic occupancy to 953  for 2017  as compared to 2016  we expect an increase in new apartment deliveries in southern california in 2018 but believe strengthening job and income growth will continue to support a favorable operating environment 

the northern california region accounted for approximately 214  of the established community rental revenue for 2017  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 16  for 2017  over the prior year average rental rates increased 11  to 2839  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 05  to 957  for 2017  as compared to 2016  we expect operating conditions to remain challenged in the northern california region in 2018 due to slower job growth and an increase in competition from new apartment deliveries 

the new england region accounted for approximately 148  of the established community rental revenue for 2017  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 24  for 2017  over the prior year average rental rates increased 23  to 2420  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 01  to 956  for 2017  as compared to 2016  we expect the operating environment in new england in 2018 to be more favorable in the suburban submarkets than in the urban submarkets due to higher levels of new apartment deliveries in the urban submarkets 

the midatlantic region accounted for approximately 140  of the established community rental revenue for 2017  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 18  for 2017  over the prior year average rental rates increased 19  to 2153  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 01  decrease in economic occupancy to 952  for 2017  as compared to 2016  we believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in the midatlantic region will limit our ability to increase rental rates in select submarkets in 2018 

the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 53  of the established community rental revenue for 2017  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 54  for 2017  over the prior year average rental rates increased 52  to 2228  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 02  to 952  for 2017  as compared to 2016  we expect strong job and income growth in 2018 in the pacific northwest region will continue to support a favorable operating environment 

management development and other fees  decreased 1452000  or 259  and 4348000  or 437  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the decreases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from fund ii and the us fund the decrease in 2016 was also due to asset management and disposition fees earned in the prior year not present in 2016 from the residual jv 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes  increased 21874000  or 54  and 29260000  or 78  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 6067000  or 20  and 7256000  or 25  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation expense bad debt and turnover and maintenance costs partially offset by decreased property insurance costs the increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased bad debt expense compensation and community repairs and maintenance costs partially offset by decreased utility costs and a decrease in snow removal and other costs related to the severe winter storms in our northeast markets that occurred during the first quarter of 2015 

property taxes  increased 16538000  or 81  and 11338000  or 59  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities increased assessments across our portfolio as well as successful appeals and reductions of supplemental taxes in the prior years in excess of those recognized in the then current year 

for established communities property taxes increased 5300000  or 35  and 6616000  or 44  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased assessments in the current year periods as well as successful appeals in the prior year periods in the companys west coast markets the increase in 2016 was primarily due to increased assessments as well as appeals and supplemental tax reversals in 2015 in excess of those recognized in 2016 for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses  increased 2521000   or 38  in 2017  as compared to the prior year the increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs in the current year partially offset by severance costs in the prior year not present in current year 

investments and investment management expense  increased by 1114000  or 231  and 452000  or 103  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to increases in compensation expense 

expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries  primarily reflect abandoned pursuit costs as well as acquisition costs related to business acquisitions that occurred prior to the adoption of asu 201701 as of october 1 2016 subsequent to the adoption of asu 201701 we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in acquisition costs being capitalized instead of expensed abandoned pursuit costs include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period these aggregate costs decreased 7186000  or 724  in 2017  and increased 3100000  or 454  in 2016  as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in acquisition costs related to communities acquired during the prior year periods that were expensed prior to the adoption of asu 201701 decreased development pursuit costs as well as the noncash writeoff of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the us fund in the prior year period in excess of amounts recognized in the current year period the increase in 2016 was primarily due to costs related to five operating communities acquired in 2016 as well as the noncash writeoff of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the us fund 

interest expense net  increased 12151000  or 65  and 11895000  or 68  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years this category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity amortization of premiumdiscount on debt and interest income the increase in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness the increase in 2016 was due to an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness as well as an increase in variable interest rates 

loss gain on the extinguishment of debt net  reflects   prepayment penalties the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired the loss of 25472000  for 2017 was primarily due to prepayment penalties of 33515000 and the noncash writeoff of deferred financing costs of 1450000 associated with the repayment of 556313000 aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 12 whollyowned operating communities in advance of their may 2019 maturity dates this was partially offset by a gain of 10839000 primarily composed of the writeoff of unamortized premium on the repayment of 670590000 principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 11 whollyowned operating communities in advance of their november 2017 maturity dates the loss of 7075000   for 2016 was primarily due to the prepayment penalty associated with the early repayment of 250000000 principal amount of 570 coupon unsecured notes and the noncash writeoff of deferred financing costs for the variable rate debt secured by avalon walnut creek 

depreciation expense  increased 52716000  or 99  and 53511000  or 112  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

general and administrative expense  “ga” increased 4902000  or 107  and 2997000  or 70  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses professional fees and sales and use tax expense the increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in legal and consulting fees as well as increased charitable contributions over the prior year 

casualty and impairment loss gain net for 2017 consists of a 9350000  impairment charge recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development in 2004 and sold in july 2017 and the net impact of the maplewood casualty loss net of associated insurance receivables of 2338000  partially offset by 5438000  of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the archstone acquisition the gain for 2016 consists of 8702000  of property damage insurance proceeds from the final insurance settlement for the edgewater casualty loss and 5732000  in net thirdparty insurance proceeds related to severe winter storms that occurred in 2015 in our northeast markets these amounts were partially offset by 10500000  of aggregate impairment charges recognized for ancillary land parcels 

equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities  increased 5782000  or 89  and decreased 5056000  or 72  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of income for the companys promoted interest partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of communities in various ventures in the current year and decreased noi from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to decreased noi from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2015 and 2016 as well as amounts received in 2015 for avalon 

at mission bay ii related to a modification of the joint venture agreement to eliminate our promoted interest for future distributions partially offset by increased gains from dispositions in 2016 

gain on sale of communities  decreased in 2017  and increased 2016  as compared to the prior years the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area the gain of 252599000  in 2017 was primarily due to the sale of six whollyowned operating communities and the gain of 374623000  in 2016 was primarily due to the sale of seven whollyowned operating communities 

loss gain on other real estate transactions  decreased in 2017  and increased 2016  as compared to the prior years the loss of 10907000  in 2017 was primarily composed of the noncash writeoff of prepaid rent associated with the purchase of land previously under a ground lease the gain of 10224000  in 2016 was primarily composed of the gain on the land we sold to an unconsolidated joint venture 

income tax expense  decreased by 164000   and   1178000  in 2017  and 2016  respectively as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the timing of federal income tax expense amounts related to dispositions of our direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the archstone acquisition which were owned through a taxable reit subsidiary 

liquidity and capital resources 

we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management when we source capital we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 201906000  at december 31 2017  a decrease of 128071000  from 329977000  at december 31 2016  the following discussion relates to changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 1256257000  in 2017  from 1160272000  in 2016  the change was driven primarily by increased noi from existing acquired and newly developed communities 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities totaled 965381000  in 2017  the net cash used was primarily due to 

 

these amounts are partially offset by 

 

financing activities—net cash used in financing activities totaled 418947000  in 2017  the net cash used was primarily due to 

 

these amounts are partially offset by 

 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we have a 1500000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility which matures in april 2020 we may extend the maturity for up to nine months provided we are not in default and upon payment of a 1500000 extension fee the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 0825  per annum  240  at january 31 2018  assuming a one month borrowing rate the annual facility fee is 0125  or approximately 1875000  annually based on the 1500000000  facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we had 163000000  under the credit facility and had 46165000  outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2018  

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility the term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2017  

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in december 2015 we commenced a fourth continuous equity program “cep iv” under which we may sell up to 1000000000  of our common stock from time to time actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep iv we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 20  of the gross sales price for shares sold cep iv also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to 1000000000  in aggregate sales price of our common stock we expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement in connection with each forward sale agreement we will pay the relevant forward seller in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price commission of up to 20  of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold in 2017  we sold 568424  shares at an average sales price of 18839  per share for net proceeds of 105478000  as of january 31 2018  we had 892915000  of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program and no forward sales agreements outstanding 

forward interest rate swap agreements 

in 2017  we entered into 300000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2018 which are outstanding as of december 31 2017  at maturity of the outstanding swap agreements we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value assuming that we issue the debt as expected the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment 

in addition during 2017  we settled an aggregate of 800000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements receiving net aggregate payments of 391000  which consisted of the following activity 

 

 

 

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following debt activity occurred during 2017  

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2017  and 2016  dollars in thousands we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest 





 

 

future financing and capital needs—portfolio and capital markets activity 

in 2018  we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including i real estate dispositions ii cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities iii borrowing capacity under our credit facility and iv secured and unsecured debt financings additional sources of liquidity in 2018  may include the issuance of common and preferred equity our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects 

before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop redevelop or acquire the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

fund ii was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds and iii additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund ii has six  institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and we have an equity investment of 2576000  net of distributions representing a 313  combined general partner and limited partner equity interest upon achievement of a threshold return we have a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest representing the first 400  of further fund ii distributions which are in addition to our share of the remaining 600  of distributions fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in august 2011 in 2017 fund ii sold its final apartment communities we expect to complete the dissolution of fund ii in 2018 

during 2017  fund ii sold its final three  communities containing 1366  apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of 272050000  our share of the gain was 26322000  and in addition we recognized income for our promoted interest of 26742000  in conjunction with the disposition of these communities fund ii repaid the remaining 127179000  of secured indebtedness at par in advance of the scheduled maturity dates 

the us fund has six  institutional investors including us we are the general partner of the us fund and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the us fund we have an equity investment of 39896000  net of distributions representing a 286  combined equity interest the us fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested the us fund has a term that expires in july 2023 assuming the exercise of two oneyear extension options 

during 2017  the us fund sold one  community containing 192  apartment homes for a sales price of 107000000  our share of the gain was 13788000  in conjunction with the disposition of this community the us fund repaid 32542000  of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity date which resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and writeoffs of deferred financing costs of which our portion was 406000  

the ac jv has four  institutional investors including us excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the ac jv we have an equity investment of 49492000  net of distributions representing a 200  equity interest the ac jv was formed in 2011 

during 2016 we entered into a joint venture to develop own and operate ava north point an apartment community located in cambridge ma which is currently under construction and expected to contain 265  apartment homes upon completion we own a 550  interest in the venture and the venture partner owns the remaining 450  interest ava north point is the third phase of a master planned development the other phases of which are owned through the ac jv during 2016 we provided the partners of the ac jv the opportunity to acquire the ava north point land parcel we owned as required in the rofo provisions for the ac jv after certain partners of the ac jv declined to participate we entered into the new joint venture and sold the land parcel to the venture in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit and we are overseeing the development in exchange for a developer fee upon sale of the land parcel we recognized a gain of 10621000  the construction of ava north point is expected to be completed during 2018 and as of december 31 2017  excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of ava north point we have an equity investment of 36370000  

during 2015 we entered into a joint venture agreement to purchase land and pursue entitlements and predevelopment activity for a mixeduse development project in sudbury ma including multifamily apartment homes retail senior housing and agerestricted housing we have a 600  ownership interest in the venture during 2017 we and our joint venture partner each acquired our respective portions of the real estate held by the venture with our portion consisting of a parcel of land acquired for an investment of 19200000  along with our joint venture partner we retain continuing involvement with the venture to fund the completion of the planned infrastructure and site work at december 31 2017  we recorded an obligation of 4340000  representing our share of costs for the venture to complete this work 

as part of the archstone acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with equity residential through which we assumed obligations of archstone in the form of preferred interests some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements the “legacy jv” we have a 400  interest in the legacy jv during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  the legacy jv redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends of which our portion was 2000000  1960000  and 14410000  respectively at december 31 2017  the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of 37579000  our share of which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets presented elsewhere in this report 

as of december 31 2017  we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures and fund ii which sold its final apartment community in 2017 refer to note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results for ventures holding operating apartment communities as of december 31 2017  detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table dollars in thousands 



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities as referenced in the table above nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so in the future in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support or take any other action as any such action would depend on a variety of factors including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities andor our returns by providing time for performance to improve 

there are no other material lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest 

contractual obligations 

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2017  dollars in thousands 



 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act 

of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should 

not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2017  our assets would have increased by 571578000  and our liabilities would have increased by 534355000  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue we defer external costs associated with originating new leases recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 47063000  45201000  and 43943000  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2017  our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our costs charged to expense would have increased by 4706000  

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2017  would have decreased by 4582000  

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a reit is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on our taxable income if we annually distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to regular federal and state corporate income taxes and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2017  our net income would have decreased by approximately 352522000  

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 

acquisition of investments in real estate 

the adoption of asu 201701 as discussed in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report has impacted our accounting framework for the acquisition of investments in real estate prior to adoption of asu 201701 on october 1 2016 we accounted for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement which required the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value typical assets and liabilities acquired include land buildings furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of above or below market leases and inplace leases in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilized various sources including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed we expensed all costs incurred related to acquisitions of operating communities subsequent to adoption of asu 201701 we assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes during 2017  we entered into 300000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2018 during 2017  we settled an aggregate of 800000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the refinancing of three  secured borrowings in may 2017 as well as our may 2017 and june 2017 unsecured note issuances in addition we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had 1460326000  and 1208262000  respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2017  and 2016  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 14867000  and 12901000  respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 7404313000  at december 31 2017  had an estimated aggregate fair value of 7296455000  at december 31 2017  contractual fixed rate debt represented 6025384000  of the fair value at december 31 2017  if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2017  the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 479977000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics 

at january 31 2017  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm shareholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital we pursue our development investment and operating activities with the purpose of creating a better way to live  our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management in addition to our inhouse development and construction capabilities we supplement our growth through our inhouse redevelopment and acquisition platforms we believe that our organizational structure which includes dedicated development and operational teams in each of our regions and strong culture are key differentiators and provide us with access to highly talented dedicated and capable associates 

we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint the avalon  brand is our core offering focusing on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services in urban and suburban markets our ava  brand is designed for people who want to live in or near urban neighborhoods and in close proximity to public transportation services shopping and nightlife ava  apartments are generally smaller many engineered for roommate living and feature modern design and a technology focus our eaves by avalon  brand is designed for renters who seek good quality apartment living often in a suburban setting with practical amenities and services at a more modest price point 

during the three years ended december 31 2016  we acquired six  apartment communities and disposed of 16  apartment communities excluding activity for the funds as defined below during the three years ended december 31 2016  we completed the development of 38  apartment communities and the redevelopment of 19  apartment communities 

on february 27 2013 pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated november 26 2012 the company together with equity residential acquired directly or indirectly all of the assets owned by archstone enterprise lp “archstone” which has since changed its name to jupiter enterprise lp including all of the ownership interests in joint ventures and other entities owned by archstone and assumed archstone’s liabilities both known and unknown with certain limited exceptions under the terms of the purchase agreement the company acquired approximately 400 of archstones assets and liabilities and equity residential acquired approximately 600 of archstone’s assets and liabilities the “archstone acquisition” 

in march 2005 we formed avalonbay value added fund lp “fund i” a private discretionary real estate investment vehicle which we managed and in which we owned a 152  interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in 2008 fund i acquired 20  communities during the three years ended december 31 2016  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of the last of the four  communities owned by fund i fund i disposed of the last of its communities in 2014 and was dissolved in april 2015 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp “fund ii” a second institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 313  interest in 2012 fund ii acquired its final operating community from the commencement of fund ii through the close of its investment period fund ii acquired 13  operating communities as of december 31 2016  fund ii owns three  communities containing 1366  apartment homes during the three years ended december 31 2016  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of nine  communities owned by fund ii 

archstone multifamily partners ac lp the “us fund” was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested as of december 31 2016  the us fund owns seven  communities containing 1269  apartment homes one of which includes a marina containing 229  boat slips in conjunction with the archstone acquisition through subsidiaries we acquired and own the general partner of the us fund and hold a 286  interest in the us fund during the three years ended december 31 2016  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of two  communities owned by the us fund 

archstone multifamily partners ac jv lp the “ac jv” is a joint venture in which we acquired archstones 200  ownership interest the ac jv was formed in 2011 and as of december 31 2016  owns three  operating apartment communities containing 921  apartment homes one of which completed development in 2014 the ac jv partnership agreement contains provisions that require us to provide a right of first offer “rofo” to the ac jv in connection with additional opportunities to acquire or develop additional interests in multifamily real estate assets within a specified geographic radius of the existing assets generally one mile or less the rofo restriction expires in 2019 

a more detailed description of fund i fund ii and the us fund collectively the “funds” the ac jv and other joint ventures and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

through subsidiaries the company and equity residential entered into three limited liability company agreements collectively the “residual jv” through which the company and equity residential acquired i certain assets of archstone that the company and equity residential have substantially divested the “residual assets” and ii various liabilities of archstone that the company and equity residential agreed to assume in conjunction with the archstone acquisition the “residual liabilities” the residual assets included a 200 interest in lake mendota investments llc and subsidiaries “swib” a joint venture which disposed of the last of its communities in 2015 various licenses insurance policies contracts office leases and other miscellaneous assets the residual liabilities include most existing or future litigation and claims related to archstone’s operations for periods before the close of the archstone acquisition except for i claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by the company or equity residential which generally remain the sole responsibility of the company or equity residential as applicable and ii certain tax and other litigation between archstone and various equity holders in archstone related to periods before the close of the archstone acquisition and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of archstone that occurred prior to closing for which the seller has agreed to indemnify the company and equity residential the company and equity residential jointly control the residual jv and the company holds a 400 economic interest in the residual jv 

during 2016  we sold 12  operating communities including sales by unconsolidated entities and recognized a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of  428370000  in addition we sold other real estate primarily composed of ancillary real estate and recognized a gain in accordance with gaap of 10224000  

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by undertaking the redevelopment primarily through an occupied turn strategy in which we continue to operate the community as we install improvements working to minimize any impact on our current residents 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired and still own 14  assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on the contributed assets our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don’t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the archstone partnership after review and investigation of archstone’s tax and accounting records we estimate that had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2016  with respect to all 14  assets the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately 54600000  at the present time we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income “noi” 

while we have achieved growth in the past through the establishment of discretionary real estate investments funds which placed certain limitations on our ability to acquire new communities during their investments periods we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue expense noi and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes see “tax matters” below 

financing strategy we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1500000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2016  we had a total of 693410  square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under development gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2016  was 21390000   10  of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail or forsale residential components of a mixeduse building or project that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions such as those described under “property management strategy” above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited 

judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment construction and operating risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

the construction and maintenance of our communities includes a risk of major casualty events that could materially damage our property and the property of others and pose the risk of personal injury while we carry insurance for such risks in amounts we deem reasonable we cannot assure that such insurance will be adequate and when we have incurred and in the future may incur such casualties we are subject to losses on account of deductibles and selfinsured amounts in any event such casualties may also expose us in the future to higher insurance premiums greater construction or operating costs either voluntarily assumed by us or as a result of new local regulations and risks to our reputation among prospective residents or municipalities from which we may seek approvals in the future all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

we have seen a recent increase in municipalities considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents based solely on market conditions depending on the nature of such laws or regulations and the number of our communities that become subject to any such restriction on rent increases our revenues and net income could be adversely affected for example in 2016 in mountain view california the voters passed a referendum that would limit rent increases on existing tenants but not on new moveins in communities built before 1995 we have three  communities with a total of 946  apartment homes that would be subject to the new law although the implementation of the mountain view ordinance is currently stayed in connection with a lawsuit challenging the ordinance filed by the california apartment association 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability for new investments 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2016  approximately 58  of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily business we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “communities—other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

we are exposed to various risks from our real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds and joint ventures  

we formed fund ii in which we have an equity interest of 313  and as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired equity interests in the us fund and the ac jv of 286  and 200  respectively which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and managing member the investment periods for fund ii and the us fund are over the funds and joint ventures collectively the ventures present risks including the following 

 

the governance provisions of our joint ventures with equity residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities  

in connection with the archstone acquisition we created joint ventures with equity residential that manage or have an interest in certain of the acquired assets and liabilities these structures involve participation in the ventures by equity residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate including the risk that equity residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures under the form for the joint venture arrangements neither we nor equity residential expect to individually have the sole power to control the ventures and an impasse could occur which could adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis we also maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches 

however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks discussed below 

earthquake risk as further described in item 2 “communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical 

severe or inclement weather risk particularly in new england and the metro new yorknew jersey area we are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding severe or inclement weather may result in increased costs such as losses and costs resulting from repair of water and wind damage removal of snow and ice and in the case of our development communities delays in construction that result in increased construction costs and delays in realizing rental revenues from a community in addition severe or inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance of our communities 

where we have a geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe that affects a region such as an earthquake that affects the west coast or a hurricane or severe winter storm that affects the midatlantic metro new yorknew jersey or new england regions may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

climate change risk   to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

terrorism risk   we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc markets that have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage and that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms and in amounts we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we have acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 

  

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may through our taxable reit subsidiaries hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to us tax as regular corporations the archstone acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

legislative or regulatory action related to federal income tax laws could adversely affect our stockholders andor our business 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder in addition according to publicly released statements a top legislative priority of the trump administration and the current congress may be significant reform of the code including significant changes to taxation of business entities and the deductibility of interest expense there is a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood timing and details of any such tax reform and the impact of any potential tax reform on our business and on the price of our common stock we cannot assure you that changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our common stock 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year the following is a description of each category 

current communities  are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup redevelopment or unconsolidated according to the following attributes 

 

 

 

 

 

development communities  are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights  are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest where we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

as of december 31 2016  communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually determined as of january 1 of each of the respective years the established communities portfolios for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



 

 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings as of january 31 2017  our current communities consisted of the following 



 

 

our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features which may include 

 

other features at various communities may include 

 

as described in item 1 “business” we operate under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  our core “ avalon”  brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services “ ava”  targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus “ eaves by avalon”  is targeted to the cost conscious “value” segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of creating a better way to live  helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 



we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2016  we completed construction of 1715  apartment homes in eight  communities and sold twelve  operating communities containing an aggregate of 4026  apartment homes the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 193 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 125 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2017  we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

 

 

 

 

for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for certain of the land leases for which we have an absolute ownership interest that expire in october 2026 november 2028 may 2041 july 2046 december 2086 and april 2095 

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 25  of the 27  development communities one development community is being developed within a joint venture and one development community is being developed with a private development partner and we will own the multifamily rental portion of the development

as of december 31 2016  we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in 27  development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 9129  apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 4045000000  we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” including the factors identified under “forwardlooking statements” for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a fee simple ownership interest in these communities directly or through a whollyowned subsidiary unless otherwise noted in the table 



 



 

during the year ended december 31 2016  the company completed the development of the following communities 



 

 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2016  there were four  communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 80700000  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 



 

 

development rights 

at december 31 2016  we had 84293000  in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in land parcels we own and 40179000  in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land as well as land associated with the building destroyed in the edgewater as defined below casualty loss not considered a development right collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 25  development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2016  includes 63082000  in original land acquisition costs the original land acquisition cost per home after consideration of planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate ranged from 24000  per home in washington  to 51000  per home in virginia  the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 8487  apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 18  development rights we control the land through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through conditional agreements or options to acquire land for the five  remaining development rights we either currently own the land have an ownership interest in a joint venture that owns the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development in addition two  development rights are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and will be constructed on land currently associated with those operating communities during the next 12 months we expect to commence construction of apartment communities on three  of the development rights for which we currently own the land with a carrying basis of 49584000  

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2016  we incurred a charge of approximately 4183000  for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 

you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the following presents a summary of the development rights 



 

 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2016  we acquired land parcels for eight  development rights as shown in the table below for an aggregate investment of 101372000  for all of the parcels construction has either started or is expected to start within the next 12 months 



  



other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of 46958000  which we do not currently plan to develop of which 20846000  was under contract to be sold as of december 31 2016  and was disposed of in january 2017 these parcels consist of both ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop and land parcels we acquired for development and now intend to sell during 2016  we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of 10500000  relating to three ancillary land parcels which we either sold during the year or intend to sell as of the date of this report we believe that the current carrying value for all other land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are future indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

disposition activity 

we sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2016 to january 31 2017  we sold our interest in seven  whollyowned communities containing 2051  apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 522850000  

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies along with other insurance policies we maintain have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from nuclear liability or acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault the hayward fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels we procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with limits of 175000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes however for communities located in california or washington the limit is 150000000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes the deductible applicable to losses resulting from earthquakes occurring in california is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building subject to a minimum of 100000 and a maximum of 25000000 per loss 

our communities are insured for property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor coverage provided under a master property insurance policy covering the majority of our communities the master policy provides a 400000000 limit for any single occurrence subject to certain sublimits and exclusions under the master policy we are subject to a 100000 deductible per occurrence as well as additional selfinsured retention for the next 350000 of loss per occurrence until the aggregate incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1500000 for the policy year 

  

our communities are insured for thirdparty liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies andor coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance policies the master commercial general liability and umbrellaexcess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions and require a selfinsured retention of 250000 per occurrence 

we utilize a whollyowned captive insurance company to insure certain risks which includes property damage and resulting business interruption losses and other construction related liability risks the captive is directly responsible for 12 of the losses incurred by the master property insurance policy on a per occurrence basis in excess of any applicable deductibles up to the first 50000000 of loss 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in january 2015 the president signed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which extended a program that is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program certain communities are insured for terrorism related losses through this federal program we have also purchased privatemarket insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of 600000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides terrorism coverage through tripra subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy and limited cyber liability insurance the crime policies protect us up to 30000000 per occurrence subject to sublimits and exclusions from employee theft of money securities or property the limited cyber liability insurance is part of our professional liability coverage and has limits of 15000000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate the cyber liability coverage protects us from certain claims arising out of data breach wrongful acts data privacy issues and media liability 

the amount of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover losses 

maplewood casualty loss 

in february 2017 a fire occurred at our avalon maplewood development community located in maplewood nj which was under construction and not yet occupied we are currently assessing our direct losses resulting from the fire which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild the portion of the development community that was destroyed andor damaged as well as our potential liability to third parties who may have incurred damages on account of the fire while we currently believe that our direct losses and any potential liability to third parties will be substantially covered by our insurance policies including coverage for the replacement cost of the building third party claims and business interruption loss subject to deductibles as well as a selfinsured portion of the property insurance for which we are obligated for 12 of the first 50000000 in losses we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter 

edgewater casualty loss 

in january 2015 a fire occurred at our avalon at edgewater apartment community located in edgewater nj “edgewater” edgewater consisted of two residential buildings one building containing 240 apartment homes was destroyed the second building containing 168 apartment homes suffered minimal damage and has been repaired in january 2016 we reached a final settlement with our property and casualty insurers regarding the property damage and lost income related to the edgewater casualty loss for which we received aggregate insurance proceeds of 73150000  after selfinsurance and deductibles we received 44142000  of these recoveries in 2015 and the remaining 29008000  in 2016 of which 8702000  was recognized as an additional net casualty gain and 20306000  as business interruption insurance proceeds 

to date a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us including five  purported class actions 21  individual actions and other subrogation actions by insurers who provided renters insurance to our residents having incurred applicable deductibles we currently believe that all of our remaining liability to third parties will not be material and will in any event be substantially covered by our insurance policies however we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as discussed immediately above in january 2015 a fire occurred at the companys avalon at edgewater apartment community in edgewater nj the company believes that the fire was caused by sparks from a torch used during repairs being performed by a company employee who was not a licensed plumber the company has since revised its maintenance policies to require that nonflame tools be used for plumbing repairs where possible or where not possible inside the building envelope that a qualified third party vendor perform the work in accordance with avalonbay policies 

the company has established protocols for processing claims from third parties who suffered losses as a result of the fire and many third parties have contacted the companys insurance carrier and settled their claims through the date of this form 10k of the 229 occupied apartments destroyed in the fire the residents of approximately 97  units have settled claims with the companys insurer and claims from an additional approximate 34  units are being evaluated by the companys insurer 

three  class action lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of occupants of the destroyed building and consolidated in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the company has agreed with class counsel to the terms of a proposed settlement which would provide a claims process with agreed upon protocols for instructing the adjuster as to how to evaluate claims and if needed an arbitration process to determine damage amounts to be paid to individual claimants covered by the class settlement on december 9 2016 class counsel refiled with the court a motion for preliminary approval of this class settlement and the company did not oppose such motion the company cannot predict when or if the court will approve the settlement a fourth  class action being heard in the same federal court was filed against the company on behalf of residents of the second edgewater building that suffered minimal damage recently a fifth  class action lawsuit was filed against the company seeking to certify a class on behalf of both buildings and other third parties the company removed this action to the same federal court as the other four  and is currently seeking to consolidate it with the fourth  class action lawsuit referenced above in addition to the class action lawsuits described above 21  lawsuits representing approximately 150  individual plaintiffs have been filed in the superior court of new jersey bergen county  law division and 20  of these lawsuits are currently pending most of the state court cases have been consolidated by the court and the company expects all of them to be consolidated shortly the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the extent of damages claimed in all of the suits there are also five  subrogation lawsuits that have been filed against the company by insurers of edgewater residents who obtained renters insurance it is the company’s position that in the majority of the applicable leases the residents waived subrogation rights one  of these lawsuits has been dismissed on that basis and the other four  are currently pending in the united states district court for the district of new jersey the district court recently denied the companys motion to dismiss which was filed in one of these lawsuits and the company is currently seeking reconsideration of that decision as well as certification to appeal 

having settled many third party claims through the insurance claims process the company currently believes that any potential remaining liability to third parties including any potential liability to third parties determined in accordance with the class settlement described above if approved will not be material to the company and will in any event be substantially covered by the companys insurance policies however the company can give no assurances in this regard and continues to evaluate this matter 

the company is involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings unrelated to the edgewater casualty loss that arise in the ordinary course of its business while no assurances can be given the company does not currently believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

business description 

we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 

our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets 

financial highlights 

for the year ended december 31 2016  net income attributable to common stockholders was 1034002000  an increase of 291964000  or 393  over the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains these amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2016  established communities noi increased by 49606000  or 48  over the prior year the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 43  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 31  over 2015  

during 2016  we raised approximately 1668474000  of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes and the sale of real estate exclusive of proceeds from the disposition of joint ventures and secured debt assumed in conjunction with acquisitions the funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of seven  operating communities one land parcel and ancillary real estate we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2016  we completed the construction of eight  communities containing an aggregate of 1715  apartment homes for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 510800000  we also started the construction of nine  communities containing an aggregate of 2732  apartment homes which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 1588600000  including our share of the total capitalized cost for one community being developed within a joint venture in which we own a 550 interest in addition during 2016  we completed the redevelopment of 10  communities containing an aggregate of 2739  apartment homes for a total investment of 115900000  excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

during the year ended december 31 2016  we sold seven  whollyowned operating communities containing an aggregate of 2051  apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of 522850000  resulting in an aggregate gain in accordance with gaap of 370301000  we also sold other real estate primarily composed of one land parcel which was sold to a joint venture in which we own a 550 interest and ancillary real estate for an aggregate sales price 41178000  resulting in an aggregate gain in accordance with gaap of 10224000  

during the year ended december 31 2016  we acquired five  communities containing an aggregate of 1265  apartment homes and 40000  square feet of retail space for an aggregate purchase price of 532350000  one community avalon clarendon was a mixeduse development originally acquired through a joint venture we established separate legal ownership of the residential and retail office and public parking components of the venture with our venture partner and as a result consolidated avalon clarendon reporting the operating results of the community as part of our consolidated operations beginning in october 2016 in conjunction with the acquisition of avalon hoboken we assumed a fixed rate secured mortgage note with a principal balance of 67904000  and a contractual interest rate of 418  maturing in december 2020 in conjunction with the acquisition of avalon columbia pike we assumed a fixed rate secured mortgage note with a principal balance of 70507000  and a contractual interest rate of 338  maturing in november 2019 

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources existing cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

communities overview 

as of december 31 2016  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 285  apartment communities containing 83667  apartment homes in 10  states and the district of columbia of which 27  communities were under development and four  communities were under redevelopment of these communities 16  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including three  owned by subsidiaries of fund ii seven  owned by the us fund three  owned by the ac jv and one  that is being developed within a joint venture in addition we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 25  whollyowned communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 8487  apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current communities development communities and development rights our current communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities 

established communities are generally consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years other stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the current year leaseup communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year unconsolidated communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2016  2015  and 2014  follows dollars in thousands 



 



net income attributable to common stockholders  increased 291964000  or 393  to 1034002000  in 2016  primarily due to an increase in noi from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in real estate sales and related gains these amounts were partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense and a loss on extinguishment of debt in the current year coupled with a gain on extinguishment of debt in the prior year net income attributable to common stockholders increased 58471000  or 86  to 742038000  in 2015  from 2014  primarily due to an increase in noi from newly developed and existing operating communities and gains from net insurance recoveries and the extinguishment of debt partially offset by a decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities 

noi  is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management expenses expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries interest expense net loss gain on extinguishment of debt net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities depreciation expense corporate income tax expense casualty and impairment gain loss net gain on sale of real estate assets gain on sale of discontinued operations income from discontinued operations and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale not classified as discontinued operations 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



 

   

the noi increases for both 2016  and 2015  as compared to the prior year consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



 

 

the increase in our established communities noi in 2016  and 2015  is due to increased rental rates partially offset by decreased economic occupancy and increased operating expenses 

rental and other income  increased in both 2016  and 2015  compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our established communities the increase for 2016  is also due to business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the edgewater casualty loss 

consolidated communities—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 67849  apartment homes for 2016  as compared to 64211  homes for 2015  and 61686  homes for 2014  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2476  for 2016  as compared to 2388  in 2015  and 2254  in 2014  

established communities—rental revenue increased 64206000  or 43  to 1541034000  for 2016  from 1476828000  in the prior year the increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 44  to 2450  per apartment home partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 01  to 955  rental revenue increased 66136000  or 50  for 2015  as compared to the prior year economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in 2016  as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region accounted for approximately 245  of the established community rental revenue for 2016  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 29  for 2016  over the prior year average rental rates increased 28  to 2972  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 01  to 957  for 2016  as compared to 2015  while new york city is absorbing a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries suburban markets surrounding the city are more insulated from this new competition and we expect to see continued growth over the prior year in the metro new yorknew jersey region in 2017 

the northern california region accounted for approximately 207  of the established community rental revenue for 2016  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 67  for 2016  over the prior year average rental rates increased 69  to 2795  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 02  decrease in economic occupancy to 952  for 2016  as compared to 2015  we expect slower job growth and elevated levels of new apartment deliveries will temper growth in 2017 relative to prior years

gain on sale of communities  increased in 2016  and 2015  as compared to the prior years the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area prior to our adoption of asu 201408 as of january 1 2014 gain on sale of communities was presented in gain on sale of discontinued operations the gain of 374623000  in 2016 was primarily due to gains on the sale of seven  whollyowned operating communities and the gain of 115625000  in 2015 was due to gains on the sale of three whollyowned operating communities 

gain on sale of other real estate increased in 2016  and 2015  as compared to the prior years the gain of 10224000  in 2016 was primarily composed of the gain on the land we sold to an unconsolidated joint venture the gain of 9647000  in 2015 was a result of the gain on sale of air rights representing the right to increase density for future residential development and two undeveloped land parcels

liquidity and capital resources 

we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management when we source capital we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 214994000  at december 31 2016  a decrease of 185513000  from 400507000  at december 31 2015  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 1143484000  in 2016  from 1056754000  in 2015  the change was driven primarily by increased noi from existing and newly developed and acquired communities and the receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities totaled 1037352000  in 2016  the net cash used was primarily due to 

 

these amounts are partially offset by 

 

financing activities—net cash used in financing activities totaled 291645000  in 2016  the net cash used was primarily due to 

 

these amounts are partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of 1122488000  

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

in january 2016 we extended the maturity of the credit facility from april 2017 to april 2020 and amended other provisions in the credit facility in addition pursuant to an option available under the terms of the credit facility with the approval of the syndicate of lenders we increased the aggregate facility size from 1300000000  to 1500000000  the “credit facility increase” we may further extend the term for up to nine months provided we are not in default and upon payment of a 1500000  extension fee in connection with the credit facility increase the applicable margin over reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates on our borrowings from time to time decreased the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 0825  per annum  160  at january 31 2017  assuming a one month borrowing rate the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus 080  to libor plus 155  based on our credit ratings in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to 65  of the credit facility amount which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate if market conditions allow in connection with the credit facility increase the annual facility fee was also amended to lower the fee to 0125  from 015  resulting in a fee of approximately 1875000  annually based on the 1500000000  facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 45321000  outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2017  

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility the term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2016  

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in december 2015 we commenced a fourth continuous equity program “cep iv” under which we may sell up to 1000000000  of our common stock from time to time actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep iv we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 20  of the gross sales price for shares sold cep iv also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to 1000000000  in aggregate sales price of our common stock we expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement in connection with each forward sale agreement we will pay the relevant forward seller in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price commission of up to 20  of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold as of december 31 2016  we had no  sales under the program and had not entered into any forward sale agreements as of january 31 2017  we had 1000000000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program 

forward interest rate swap agreements 

during 2015 and 2016  we entered into 1200000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2016 and 2017 during 2016  we settled 400000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the may 2016 unsecured notes issuance making a payment of 14847000  at maturity of the remaining outstanding forward interest rate swap agreements we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value assuming that we issue the debt as expected the impact from settling these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment 

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following debt activity occurred during 2016  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

the following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2016  and 2015  dollars in thousands we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest 





 



future financing and capital needs—portfolio and capital markets activity 

in 2017  we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including i real estate dispositions ii cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities iii borrowing capacity under our credit facility and iv secured and unsecured debt financings additional sources of liquidity in 2017  may include the issuance of common and preferred equity our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects 

before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop redevelop or acquire the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

fund ii was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds and iii additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund ii has six  institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund ii we have an equity investment of 19737000  net of distributions representing a 313  combined general partner and limited partner equity interest upon achievement of a threshold return we have a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest representing the first 200  of further fund ii distributions which are in addition to our share of the remaining 800  of distributions during 2016  we recognized income of 7985000  for our promoted interest fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in august 2011 fund ii has a term that expires in august 2020 assuming the exercise of two oneyear extension options 

during 2016  fund ii sold three  communities containing an aggregate of 1514  apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of 382950000  our share of the total gain in accordance with gaap was 41501000  in conjunction with the disposition of these communities fund ii repaid 156248000  of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates which resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and writeoffs of deferred financing costs of which our portion was 1768000

in may 2016 we entered into a joint venture agreement to facilitate the acquisition of avalon clarendon located in arlington va avalon clarendon is part of a mixeduse development containing residential retail office and public parking we contributed 120300000  to the venture for our share of the purchase price we had shared control of the overall venture but had all of the rights and obligations associated with the residential component of avalon clarendon containing 300  apartment homes the joint venture partner had all of the rights and obligations associated with the retail office and public parking components of the mixeduse development during september 2016 we established separate legal ownership of the residential and retail office and public parking components of the venture with our venture partner and we retained all of the rights and obligations associated with the residential component after this legal separation beginning october 2016 we began reporting the operating results of avalon clarendon as part of our consolidated operations in conjunction with the consolidation of avalon clarendon we recorded the consolidated assets at fair value resulting in a gain of 4322000  for the difference between the fair value of avalon clarendon and our equity interest at the date of consolidation of 115848000  primarily attributable to depreciation recognized during the period the community was owned in the joint venture 

as part of the archstone acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with equity residential through which we assumed obligations of archstone in the form of preferred interests some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements the “legacy jv” we have a 400  interest in the legacy jv during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  the legacy jv redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends of which our portion was 1960000  14410000  and 6300000  respectively at december 31 2016  the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of 39921000  our share of which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets presented elsewhere in this report 

as of december 31 2016  we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting excluding development joint ventures refer to note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results for ventures holding operating apartment communities as of december 31 2016  detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table dollars in thousands 



 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 5 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities as referenced in the table above nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so in the future in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support or take any other action as any such action would depend on a variety of factors including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities andor our returns by providing time for performance to improve 

with respect to fund ii each individual mortgage loan was made to a special purpose single asset subsidiary of fund ii each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only except under exceptional circumstances such as fraud or misapplication of funds in which case fund ii could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan in no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in fund ii including against us or our whollyowned subsidiaries that invest in fund ii a default by fund ii or a fund ii subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other nonfund subsidiaries or affiliates if fund ii or a subsidiary of fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan the value of our investment in fund ii would likely decline if a fund ii subsidiary or fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan we andor the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support fund ii through additional equity contributions andor take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default such as foreclosure of a fund ii asset 

there are no other material lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest 

contractual obligations 

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2016  dollars in thousands 



 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

federal income tax law changes and updates 

the following discussion updates the disclosures under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment” in the prospectus dated february 19 2015 contained in our registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on february 19 2015 

the discussion in the last sentence under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmentother us federal income tax withholding and reporting requirements” on page 61 is replaced with the following sentence ‘‘withholding under this legislation will apply after december 31 2018 with respect to the gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce us source interest or dividends and currently applies with respect to other withholdable payments’’ 

the discussion under “federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmenttaxation of avalonbay as a reitownership of partnership interests by a reit” on page 47 is supplemented by inserting the paragraph below at the end of that subsection 

under the code a partnership that is not treated as a corporation under the publicly traded partnership rules generally is not subject to us federal income tax instead each partner is allocated its distributive share of the partnership’s items of income gain loss deduction and credit and is required to take such items into account in determining the partner’s income however a recent law change enacted under the bipartisan budget act of 2015 effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 requires the partnership to pay the hypothetical increase in partnerlevel taxes including interest and penalties resulting from an adjustment of partnership tax items on audit or in other tax proceedings unless the partnership elects an alternative method under which the taxes resulting from the adjustment and interest and penalties are assessed at the partner level many uncertainties remain as to the application of these rules including the application of the alternative method to partners that are reits and the impact they will have on us however it is possible that partnerships in which we invest may be subject to us federal income tax interest and penalties in the event of a us federal income tax audit as a result of these law changes 

recent legislation modifies several of the reit rules discussed in the prospectus the “protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015” the “act” was enacted on december 18 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to reit qualification and taxation some of these implicate certain taxrelated disclosure contained in the prospectus and are briefly summarized below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act 

of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 



 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method excluding the residual jv at december 31 2016  our assets would have increased by 827020000  and our liabilities would have increased by 706110000  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue we defer external costs associated with originating new leases recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 45201000  43943000  and 37433000  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2016  our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our costs charged to expense would have increased by 4520000  

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2016  would have decreased by 4018000  

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2016  our net income would have decreased by approximately 415669000  

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 

acquisition of investments in real estate 

the adoption of asu 201701 as discussed in note 1 “organization basis of presentation and significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report has impacted our accounting framework for the acquisition of investments in real estate prior to adoption of asu 201701 on october 1 2016 we accounted for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement which required the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value typical assets and liabilities acquired include land buildings furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of above or below market leases and inplace leases in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilized various sources including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed we expensed all costs incurred related to acquisitions of operating communities subsequent to adoption of asu 201701 we assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes during 2015 and 2016  we entered into 1200000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2016 and 2017 in may 2016 we settled 400000000  of the aggregate outstanding swaps in conjunction with our may 2016 unsecured note issuance in addition we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had 1208262000  and 1345182000  respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2016  and 2015  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 12901000  and 14492000  respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 7076758000  at december 31 2016  had an estimated aggregate fair value of 6963089000  at december 31 2016  contractual fixed rate debt represented 5926025000  of the fair value at december 31 2016  if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2016  the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 334076000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns on apartment community investments relative to other markets 

at january 31 2016  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 8 segment reporting of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm shareholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital we pursue our development investment and operating activities with the purpose of creating a better way to live  our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management in addition to our inhouse development and construction capabilities we supplement our growth through our inhouse redevelopment and acquisition platforms we believe that our organizational structure which includes dedicated development and operational teams in each of our regions and strong culture are key differentiators and provide us with access to highly talented dedicated and capable associates 

we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint the avalon  brand is our core offering focusing on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services in urban and suburban markets our ava  brand is designed for people who want to live in or near urban neighborhoods and in close proximity to public transportation services shopping and nightlife ava  apartments are generally smaller many engineered for roommate living and feature modern design and a technology focus our eaves by avalon  brand is designed for renters who seek good quality apartment living often in a suburban setting with practical amenities and services at a more modest price point 

on february 27 2013 pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated november 26 2012 the company together with equity residential acquired directly or indirectly all of the assets owned by archstone enterprise lp archstone which has since changed its name to jupiter enterprise lp including all of the ownership interests in joint ventures and other entities owned by archstone and assumed archstone’s liabilities both known and unknown with certain limited exceptions under the terms of the purchase agreement the company acquired approximately 400 of archstones assets and liabilities and equity residential acquired approximately 600 of archstone’s assets and liabilities the “archstone acquisition” 

during the three years ended december 31 2015  excluding activity for the funds as defined below and interests acquired in unconsolidated joint ventures as part of the archstone acquisition detailed below we acquired 56  apartment communities of which 54  were acquired as part of the archstone acquisition during the three years ended december 31 2015  we disposed of 17  apartment communities six  of which were acquired in the archstone acquisition and completed the development of 42  apartment communities and the redevelopment of 15  apartment communities in addition we acquired two  whollyowned communities in 2016  through the date this form 10k was filed 

in march 2005 we formed avalonbay value added fund lp fund i a private discretionary real estate investment vehicle which we managed and in which we owned a 152  interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in 2008 fund i acquired 20  communities during the three years ended december 31 2015  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of the last of the 11  communities owned by fund i fund i disposed of the last of its communities in 2014 and was dissolved in april 2015

in conjunction with the archstone acquisition excluding the residual jv we acquired interests in three  additional joint ventures archstone multifamily partners ac lp the us fund archstone multifamily partners ac jv lp the ac jv and brandywine apartments of maryland llc brandywine 

the us fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested as of december 31 2015  the us fund owns nine  communities containing 1730  apartment homes one of which includes a marina containing 229  boat slips through subsidiaries we acquired and own the general partner of the fund and hold a 286  interest in the fund in 2016  through the date this form 10k was filed the us fund had sold two  communities 

the ac jv is a joint venture in which we acquired archstones 200  ownership interest the ac jv was formed in 2011 and owns three  operating apartment communities containing 921  apartment homes one of which completed development in 2014 the ac jv partnership agreement contains provisions that require us to provide a right of first offer rofo to the ac jv in connection with additional opportunities to acquire or develop additional interests in multifamily real estate assets within a specified geographic radius of the existing assets generally one mile or less the rofo restriction expires in 2019 

brandywine owns a 305  apartment home community located in washington dc which is managed by a third party brandywine is comprised of five  members who hold various interests in the joint venture in conjunction with the archstone acquisition we acquired a 261 equity interest in the venture and subsequently purchased an additional 26 interest and as of december 31 2015  hold a 287  equity interest in the venture 

a more detailed description of fund i fund ii and the us fund collectively the funds the ac jv brandywine and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 5 investments in real estate entities of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

through subsidiaries the company and equity residential entered into three limited liability company agreements collectively the “residual jv” through which the company and equity residential acquired i certain assets of archstone that the company and equity residential have divested to third parties or to the company or equity residential the “residual assets” and ii various liabilities of archstone that the company and equity residential agreed to assume in conjunction with the archstone acquisition the “residual liabilities” the residual assets included a 200 interest in lake mendota investments llc and subsidiaries swib a joint venture which disposed of the last of its communities in 2015 various licenses insurance policies contracts office leases and other miscellaneous assets the residual liabilities include most existing or future litigation and claims related to archstone’s operations for periods before the close of the archstone acquisition except for i claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by the company or equity residential which generally remain the sole responsibility of the company or equity residential as applicable and ii certain tax and other litigation between archstone and various equity holders in archstone related to periods before the close of the archstone acquisition and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of archstone that occurred prior to closing for which the seller has agreed to indemnify the company and equity residential the company and equity residential jointly control the residual jv and the company holds a 400 economic interest in the residual jv 

during 2015  we sold seven  operating communities including sales by unconsolidated entities excluding the residual jv and recognized a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap of  145351000  in addition we sold two  undeveloped land parcels and air rights representing the right to increase density for future residential development and recognized a gain in accordance with gaap of 9647000  

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

 3 

 after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 communities in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term development is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to construction refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by undertaking the redevelopment primarily through an occupied turn strategy in which we continue to operate the community as we install improvements working to minimize any impact on our current residents 

throughout this report the term redevelopment is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as reconstruction which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired 14 assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or repaying secured financing on the contributed assets as of december 31 2015  the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would be triggered by the sale of all 14  contributed assets is estimated to be approximately 41700000  

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence 

acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income noi 

while we have achieved growth in the past through the establishment of discretionary real estate investments funds which placed certain limitations on our ability to acquire new communities during their investments periods we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

 onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue expense and noi produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a taxable reit subsidiary which is a subsidiary that is treated as a c corporation subject to federal income taxes see tax matters below 

financing strategy we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1500000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the credit facility sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or 

debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 660605  square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under construction gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2015  was 18528000   10  of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail or forsale residential components of a mixeduse building or project that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions such as those described under property management strategy above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a risk factors 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 8 

 costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as taxexempt bonds and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2015  approximately 60  of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily business we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 communities—other land and real estate assets in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

we are exposed to various risks from our real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds  

we formed fund ii in which we have an equity interest of 313  and as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired equity interests in the us fund and the ac jv of 286  and 200  respectively which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and managing member the investment periods for fund ii and the us fund are over the funds present risks including the following 

 12 

 the governance provisions of our joint ventures with equity residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities  

in connection with the archstone acquisition we created joint ventures with equity residential that manage certain of the acquired assets and liabilities these structures involve participation in the ventures by equity residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate including the risk that equity residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures under the form for the joint venture arrangements neither we nor equity residential expect to individually have the sole power to control the ventures and an impasse could occur which could adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis we also maintain cyber risk insurance to cover certain risks arising out of data and network breaches 

however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

earthquake risk as further described in item 2 communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical 

severe or inclement weather risk particularly in new england and the metro new yorknew jersey area we are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding severe or inclement weather may result in increased costs such as losses and costs resulting from repair of water and wind damage removal of snow and ice and in the case of our development communities delays in construction that result in increased construction costs and delays in realizing rental revenues from a community in addition severe or inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance of our communities 

where we have a geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe that affects a region such as an earthquake that affects the west coast or a hurricane or severe winter storm that affects the midatlantic metro new yorknew jersey or new england regions may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

terrorism risk   we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc markets that have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities 

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other 

contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties 

we cannot assure you that 

 our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition 

future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may through our taxable reit subsidiaries hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to us tax as regular corporations the archstone acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

 item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities redevelopment communities and unconsolidated communities while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year 

the following is a description of each category 

current communities  are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup redevelopment or unconsolidated according to the following attributes 

 development communities  are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights  are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest where we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

as of december 31 2015  communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually determined as of january 1 of each of the respective years the established communities portfolios for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



 

 current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings as of january 31 2016  our current communities consisted of 140  gardenstyle of which 18  are mixed communities and include town homes 23  highrise and 94  midrise apartment communities 

our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features which may include 

 other features at various communities may include 

 as described in item 1 business we operate under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  our core avalon  brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services ava  targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an 

emphasis on modern design and a technology focus eaves by avalon  is targeted to the cost conscious value segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of creating a better way to live  helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities excluding indirect interests associated with the residual jv are located in the following geographic markets 



we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2015  we completed construction of 4170  apartment homes in 13  communities and sold seven  communities containing an aggregate of 2311  apartment homes the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 191 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 132 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2016  we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

 20 

 for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for certain of the land leases for which we have an absolute ownership interest that expire in october 2026 november 2028 may 2041 july 2046 december 2086 and april 2095 

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 25 of the 26  development communities we are developing one development community with a private development partner and we will own the multifamily rental portion of the development 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2016  there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 

profile of current development and unconsolidated communities 1 



















 

 

development communities 

as of december 31 2015  we had 26  development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 8112  apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 2884800000  we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations including the factors identified under forwardlooking statements for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities unless otherwise noted in the table 



 

 32 

 during the year ended december 31 2015  the company completed the development of the following communities 



 

 redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2015  there were nine  communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 122000000  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 



 

 development rights 

at december 31 2015  we had 484377000  in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in land parcels we own and 37577000  in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 32  development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2015  includes 442016000  in original land acquisition costs the original land acquisition cost per home after consideration of planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate ranged from 16000  per home in massachusetts  to 326000  per home in new york  the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 9634  apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 24  development rights we control the land through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through conditional agreements or options to acquire land for the eight  remaining development rights we either currently own the land have an ownership interest in a joint venture that owns the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2015  we incurred a charge of approximately 3016000  for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 

you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the following presents a summary of these development rights 



 

 land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2015  we acquired direct and indirect interests in land parcels for eight  development rights as shown in the table below for an aggregate investment of approximately 480550000  for six  of the eight  parcels construction has either started or is expected to start within the next 12 months 



 

 35 

other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately 28968000  which we do not currently plan to develop these parcels consist primarily of ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop we currently believe on the filing date of this report there is no need to record a charge for impairment for these parcels however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

disposition activity 

we sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2015 to january 31 2016  we sold our interest in three  whollyowned communities containing 851  apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 265500000  

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 150000000 of coverage earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a 175000000 limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate in california the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building with a maximum of 25000000 per loss our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 350000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional selfinsured retention until the total incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1500000 we selfinsure a portion of our property insurance which includes the earthquake risks 

through a whollyowned captive insurance company the company is responsible for 12 of the losses for its property insurance coverage in excess of any applicable deductible up to the first 50000000 of loss with amounts beyond that covered by thirdparty insurance 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program congress reauthorized tripra in january 2015 for six years we have also purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 400000000 including insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides terrorism coverage through tripra subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 30000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property this amount may not be sufficient to cover losses that may be in excess of the policy limits 

edgewater casualty gain 

in january 2015 a fire occurred at the company’s avalon at edgewater apartment community located in edgewater new jersey edgewater edgewater consisted of two residential buildings one building containing 240 apartment homes was destroyed the second building containing 168 apartment homes suffered minimal damage and has been repaired in january 2016 the company reached a final settlement with its property and casualty insurers regarding the property damage and lost income related to the edgewater fire resulting in aggregate insurance recoveries for these aspects of this matter after selfinsurance and deductibles of 73008000 the company received 44000000 of these recoveries in 2015 and expects to receive the remaining 29008000 during the three months ending march 31 2016 which will be recognized as casualty gain and business interruption insurance recovery 

to date a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us including four purported class actions having incurred applicable deductibles the company currently believes that all of its remaining liability to third parties will be substantially covered by its insurance policies however the company can give no assurances in this regard and continues to evaluate this matter 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as discussed immediately above in january 2015 a fire occurred at the companys avalon at edgewater apartment community in edgewater nj 

the company believes that the fire was caused by sparks from a torch used during repairs being performed by a company employee who was not a licensed plumber the company has since revised its maintenance policies to require that nonflame tools be used for plumbing repairs where possible or where not possible inside the building envelope that a qualified third party vendor perform the work in accordance with avalonbay policies 

the company is aware that third parties incurred significant property damage and are claiming other losses such as relocation costs as a result of the fire the company has established protocols for processing claims and has encouraged any party who sustained a loss to contact the company’s insurance carrier to file a claim through the date of this form 10k of the 229 occupied apartments destroyed in the fire the residents of approximately 76 units have settled claims with our insurer and claims from an additional 44 units are being evaluated by our insurer 

to date four putative class action lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of avalon at edgewater residents and others who may have been harmed by the fire the court has consolidated these actions in the united states district court for the district of new jersey in addition 18 lawsuits representing approximately 145 individual plaintiffs have been filed in the superior court of new jersey bergen county  law division these cases have been consolidated by the court the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the extent of damages claimed having incurred applicable deductibles the company currently believes that all of its remaining liability to third parties will be substantially covered by its insurance policies however the company can give no assurances in this regard and continues to evaluate this matter 

the company is involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings unrelated to the edgewater fire that arise in the ordinary course of its business while no assurances can be given the company does not currently believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

business description 

we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns on apartment community investment relative to other markets we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 

our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select us markets providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value we pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are the best markets and submarkets leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets 

financial highlights 

for the year ended december 31 2015  net income attributable to common stockholders was 742038000  an increase of 58471000  or 86  over the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in noi from newly developed and existing operating communities and gains from net insurance recoveries and the extinguishment of debt partially offset by a decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities 

for the year ended december 31 2015  established communities noi increased by 53656000  or 58  over the prior year the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 50  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 30  over 2014  

during 2015  we raised approximately 1823743000  of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes settlement of the forward equity contract to sell 4500000  shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of 14654  per share borrowing the final 50000000  available under the term loan and asset sales exclusive of proceeds from the disposition of joint ventures the funds raised from asset sales consist of the proceeds from the sale of three  communities two  undeveloped land parcels and air rights for gross sales proceeds of 289320000  we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2015  we completed the development of 13  communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 1312700000  we also started the development of 13  communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 1191500000  in addition during 2015  we completed the redevelopment of four  communities for a total investment of 59600000  excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources existing cash on hand operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we sold three  communities containing an aggregate of 851  apartment homes for an aggregate gross sales price of 265500000  and an aggregate gain in accordance with gaap of 115625000  we also sold two  undeveloped land parcels and air rights representing the right to increase density for future residential development for 23820000  resulting in a gain in accordance with gaap of 9647000  

communities overview 

as of december 31 2015  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 285  apartment communities containing 83696  apartment homes in 11  states and the district of columbia of which 26  communities were under construction and nine  communities were under reconstruction of these communities 20  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including six  owned by subsidiaries of fund ii and nine  owned by the us fund in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 32  whollyowned communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 9634  apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities development communities and development rights our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities to be compared between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 segment reporting of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found in liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2015  2014  and 2013  follows dollars in thousands 



 

 

net income attributable to common stockholders  increased 58471000  or 86  to 742038000  in 2015  primarily due to an increase in noi from newly developed and existing operating communities and gains from net insurance recoveries and the extinguishment of debt partially offset by a decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities net income attributable to common stockholders increased 330426000  or 936  in 2014  from 2013  primarily due to an increase in income from unconsolidated real estate entities resulting from the gains on sales of communities in various ventures including the company’s promoted interests increased noi from newly developed and acquired communities losses on an interest rate contract in the prior year not present in 2014 a decrease in expensed acquisition costs related to the archstone acquisition and a decrease in depreciation expense related to inplace leases acquired as part of the archstone acquisition 

noi  is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management expenses expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net interest expense gain loss on extinguishment of debt loss on interest rate contract general and administrative expense joint venture income loss depreciation expense corporate income tax expense casualty gain loss and impairment loss net gain on sale of real estate assets gain on sale of discontinued operations income from discontinued operations and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale not classified as discontinued operations 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



 

 the noi increases for both 2015  and 2014  as compared to the prior year consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



the increase in our established communities noi in 2015  and 2014  is due to increased rental rates partially offset by decreased economic occupancy and increased operating expenses 

rental and other income  increased in both 2015  and 2014  compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our established communities 

overall portfolio—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 64211  apartment homes for 2015  as compared to 61686  homes for 2014  and 57240  homes for 2013  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2388  for 2015  as compared to 2254  in 2014  and 2171  in 2013  

established communities—rental revenue increased 66136000  or 50  to 1382895000  for 2015  from 1316759000  in the prior year the increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 53  to 2358  per apartment home partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 03  to 956  rental revenue increased 36096000  or 39  for 2014  as compared to the prior year economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in 2015  as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region accounted for approximately 276  of the established community rental revenue for 2015  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 34  for 2015  over the prior year average rental rates increased 40  to 2928  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 06  decrease in economic occupancy to 956  for 2015  as compared to 2014  while new york city is absorbing a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries suburban markets surrounding the city are more insulated from this new competition and we expect to see continued growth over the prior year in the metro new yorknew jersey region in 2016 

the northern california region accounted for approximately 198  of the established community rental revenue for 2015  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 95  for 2015  over the prior year average rental rates increased 104  to 2593  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 09  decrease in economic occupancy to 954  for 2015  as compared to 2014  although we project job growth to moderate and new apartment deliveries to remain elevated we expect the northern california region will continue to produce strong revenue growth in 2016 

the southern california region accounted for approximately 182  of the established community rental revenue for 2015  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 63  for 2015  over the prior year average rental rates increased 65  to 1984  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 02  decrease in economic occupancy to 958  for 2015  as compared to 2014  southern california has seen steady job growth and limited new apartment supply which we expect will continue to support favorable operating results during 2016 

the midatlantic region accounted for approximately 151  of the established community rental revenue for 2015  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 08  for 2015  over the prior year average rental rates increased 05  to 2070  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 03  to 956  for 2015  as compared to 2014  although new apartment supply will remain elevated accelerating job growth is expected to support continued modest growth in 2016

the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 55  of the established community rental revenue for 2015  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 71  for 2015  over the prior year average rental rates increased 73  to 1945  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 02  decrease in economic occupancy to 951  for 2015  as compared to 2014  we believe that healthy rental revenue growth will continue in 2016 although it may be tempered by the delivery of new apartment homes

investments and investment management  costs decreased 115000  or 26  in 2015  and increased by 495000  or 124  in 2014  as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a decline in our investment fund management activity partially offset by an increase in compensation costs the increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs partially offset by a decline in our investment fund management activity 

expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries  primarily reflect the costs incurred related to our asset investment activity abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits offset by any recoveries associated with acquisitions for periods prior to our ownership these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period these costs increased 10539000  in 2015  and decreased 48767000  in 2014  as compared to the prior years the increase in 2015 was primarily due to receipts in 2014 related to communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition for periods prior to the company’s ownership which are primarily comprised of property tax and mortgage insurance refunds as well as increased costs associated with the acquisition of real estate and abandonment of pursuits as compared to the prior year the decrease in 2014 as compared to the prior year was due to the archstone acquisition in 2013 as well as 

receipts in 2014 related to communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition for periods prior to the company’s ownership discussed above

gain on sale of real estate increased in 2015  and 2014  as compared to the prior years the increase in 2015 was a result of the gain on sale of air rights representing the right to increase density for future residential development and two undeveloped land parcels the increase in 2014 was due to changes in volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels 

gain on sale of communities  increased in 2015  and 2014  as compared to the prior years the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area prior to our adoption of asu 201408 as of january 1 2014 gain on sale of communities was presented in gain on sale of discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources 

we employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management when we source capital we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 400507000  at december 31 2015  a decrease of 108953000  from 509460000  at december 31 2014  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 1056754000  in 2015  from 886641000  in 2014  the increase was driven primarily by increased noi from existing and newly developed communities and the timing of payments of corporate obligations 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities of 1199517000  in 2015  is related to investments in assets primarily through development and redevelopment partially offset by proceeds received for dispositions and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures in 2015  we invested 1625191000  in the following areas 

 these amounts are partially offset by 

 financing activities—net cash provided by financing activities totaled 33810000  in 2015  the net cash usedprovided is primarily due to 

 50 

 these amounts are partially offset by 

 variable rate unsecured credit facility 

as of december 31 2015  we had a 1300000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility which was scheduled to mature in april 2017 

in january 2016 we extended the maturity of the credit facility from april 2017 to april 2020  and amended other provisions in the credit facility in addition pursuant to an option available under the terms of the credit facility with the approval of the syndicate of lenders we increased the aggregate facility size from 1300000000  to 1500000000  the credit facility increase we may further extend the term for up to nine months provided we are not in default and upon payment of a 1500000  extension fee in connection with the credit facility increase the applicable margin over reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates on our borrowings from time to time decreased the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor  plus 0825  per annum  125  at january 31 2016  assuming a one month borrowing rate the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus 080  to libor plus 155  based on our credit ratings in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to 65  of the credit facility amount which allows banks that are part the lender consortium to bid to make loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate if market conditions allow in connection with the credit facility increase the annual facility fee was also amended to lower the fee to 0125  from 015  approximately 1875000  annually based on the 1500000000  facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 50299000  outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2016  

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility the term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

 we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2015  

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in august 2012 we commenced a third continuous equity program cep iii under which were authorized by our board of directors to sell up to 750000000  of shares of our common stock from time to time during a 36 month period cep iii expired in august 2015 and we had no  sales under the program during the year ended december 31 2015  

in december 2015 we commenced a fourth continuous equity program cep iv under which we may sell up to 1000000000  of our common stock from time to time actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep iv we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 20  of the gross sales price for shares sold cep iv 

also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to 1000000000  in aggregate sales price of our common stock we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price however we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement in connection with each forward sale agreement we will pay the relevant forward seller in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price commission of up to 20  of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold as of december 31 2015  we had no  sales under the program and had not entered into any forward sale agreements as of january 31 2016  we had 1000000000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program 

forward equity contract 

on september 9 2014 based on a market closing price of 15583  per share on that date we entered into a forward contract to sell 4500000  shares of common stock for an initial forward price of 15174  per share net of offering fees and discounts the forward the sales price and proceeds achieved were determined on the dates of settlement with adjustments during the term of the contract for the company’s dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varied with changes in the fed funds rate during the year ended december 31 2015  we issued 4500000  shares of common stock at a weighted average sales price of 14654  per share for net proceeds of 659423000  in settlement of the forward 

forward interest rate swap agreements 

during 2015  we entered into 600000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2016 and 2017 at maturity of the agreements we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value assuming that we issue the debt as expected the impact from settling these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment during january and february 2016 we entered into 450000000  additional forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability of interest rates on an incremental portion of expected debt activity in 2016 and 2017 

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility or term loan although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following debt activity occurred during 2015  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 the following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2015  dollars in thousands as compared to the amounts of debt outstanding as of at december 31 2014  we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest

 future financing and capital needs—portfolio and capital markets activity 

in 2016 we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including i real estate dispositions ii cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities iii borrowing capacity under our credit facility and iv secured and unsecured debt financings additional sources of liquidity in 2016 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects 

before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop redevelop or acquire the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets we believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

the funds were established to engage in real estate acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds and iii additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 5 investments in real estate entities of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

we have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities as referenced in the table above nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so in the future in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support or take any other action as any such action would depend on a variety of factors including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities andor our returns by providing time for performance to improve 

with respect to fund ii each individual mortgage loan was made to a special purpose single asset subsidiary of fund ii each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only except under exceptional circumstances such as fraud or misapplication of funds in which case fund ii could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan in no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in fund ii including against us or our whollyowned subsidiaries that invest in fund ii a default by fund ii or a fund ii subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other nonfund subsidiaries or affiliates if fund ii or a subsidiary of fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan the value of our investment in fund ii would likely decline if a fund ii subsidiary or fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan we andor the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support fund ii through additional equity contributions andor take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default such as foreclosure of a fund ii asset 

in addition as part of the formation of fund ii we provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee the guarantee provided that if upon final liquidation of fund ii the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of fund ii whether from operating cash flow or property sales did not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner then we would pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall but in no event more than 10  of the total capital contributions made by the partner during the year ended december 31 2015  the limited partner transferred its investment interest to an unrelated third party the guarantee was not transferred with the investment interest so we have no further obligation under the guarantee 

there are no other material lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest 

contractual obligations 

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2015  dollars in thousands

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effects of a decline in market rents similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

federal income tax law changes and updates 

the following discussion updates the disclosures under ‘‘federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment’’ in the prospectus dated february 19 2015 contained in our registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on february 19 2015 

the discussion in the last sentence under ‘‘federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmentother us federal income tax withholding and reporting requirements’’ on page 61 is replaced with the following sentence ‘‘withholding under this legislation will apply after december 31 2018 with respect to the gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce us source interest or dividends and currently applies with respect to other withholdable payments’’ 

the discussion under ‘‘federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investmenttaxation of avalonbay as a reitownership of partnership interests by a reit’’ on page 47 is supplemented by inserting the paragraph below at the end of that subsection 

under the code a partnership that is not treated as a corporation under the publicly traded partnership rules generally is not subject to us federal income tax instead each partner is allocated its distributive share of the partnership’s items of income gain loss deduction and credit and is required to take such items into account in determining the partner’s income however a recent law change enacted under the bipartisan budget act of 2015 effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 requires the partnership to pay the hypothetical increase in partnerlevel taxes including interest and penalties resulting from an adjustment of partnership tax items on audit or in other tax proceedings unless the partnership elects an alternative method under which the taxes resulting from the adjustment and interest and penalties are assessed at the partner level many uncertainties remain as to the application of these rules including the application of the alternative method to partners that are reits and the impact they will have on us however it is possible that partnerships in which we invest may be subject to us federal income tax interest and penalties in the event of a us federal income tax audit as a result of these law changes 

recent legislation modifies several of the reit rules discussed in the prospectus the “protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015” the “act” was enacted on december 18 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to reit qualification and taxation some of these implicate certain taxrelated disclosure contained in the prospectus and are briefly summarized below

 forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains forwardlooking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words believe expect anticipate intend estimate assume project plan may shall will and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking 

statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a risk factors in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 organization and basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method excluding the residual jv at december 31 2015  our assets would have increased by 1232958000  and our liabilities would have increased by 967676000  

we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue we defer external costs associated with originating new leases recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 43943000  37433000  and 38128000  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2015  our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our costs charged to expense would have increased by 4394000  

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2015  would have decreased by 3758000  

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2015  our net income would have decreased by approximately 298299000  

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 

acquisition of investments in real estate 

we account for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement which requires the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value typical assets and liabilities acquired include land building furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovebelow market leases and inplace leases in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes during 2015 we entered into 600000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of the companys expected debt issuance activity in 2016 and 2017 through the date of this form 10k we entered into an additional 450000000  of forward interest rate swap agreements also to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of the companys expected debt issuance activity in 2016 and 2017 in addition we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had 1345182000  and 1297461000  respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2015  and 2014  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 14492000  and 13035000  respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 6481291000  at december 31 2015  had an estimated aggregate fair value of 6368758000  at december 31 2015  contractual fixed rate debt represented 5304633000  of the fair value at december 31 2015  if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2015  the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 368234000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns on apartment community investments relative to other markets 

at january 31 2015  we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 any discussion of apartment communities and homes as of december 31 2014  and january 31 2015  includes 240 apartment homes which were destroyed and are uninhabitable as a result of the fire at avalon at edgewater in january 2015 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we intend to raze or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 segment reporting of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire an interest in apartment communities in our selected markets iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital our strategy is to be leaders in multifamily market research consumer insight and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming us submarkets a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint the avalon  brand is our core offering focusing on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services in urban and suburban markets our ava  brand is designed for people who want to live in or near urban neighborhoods and in close proximity to public transportation services shopping and nightlife ava  apartments are generally smaller many engineered for roommate living and feature modern design and a technology focus our eaves by avalon  brand is designed for renters who seek good quality apartment living often in a suburban setting with practical amenities and services at a more modest price point 

during the three years ended december 31 2014  excluding activity for the funds as defined below we acquired 59  apartment communities of which 54  were acquired as part of the archstone acquisition as defined in this form 10k in addition in 2013 in conjunction with the archstone acquisition excluding the residual jv we acquired interests in three  unconsolidated joint ventures as well as the residual jv as discussed below which as of december 31 2014  own an aggregate of 13  apartment communities during the three years ended december 31 2014  we disposed of 16  apartment communities six  of which were acquired in the archstone acquisition and completed the development of 37  apartment communities and the redevelopment of 22  apartment communities during 2012 we also purchased our joint venture partners interest in one operating community obtaining a 100 ownership interest in that apartment community in addition we sold one  whollyowned community in 2015  through the date this form 10k was filed 

in march 2005 we formed avalonbay value added fund lp fund i a private discretionary real estate investment vehicle which we manage and in which we own a 152  interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in 2008 fund i acquired 20  communities during the three years ended december 31 2014  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of the last of the 17  communities owned by fund i during 2014  fund i disposed of its final four communities fund i has a term that expires in march 2015 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp fund ii a second institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 313  interest in 2012 fund ii acquired its final operating community from the commencement of fund ii through the close of its investment period fund ii acquired 13  operating communities during the three years ended december 31 2014  we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of three  communities owned by fund ii 

in conjunction with the archstone acquisition excluding the residual jv we acquired interests in three  additional joint ventures archstone multifamily partners ac lp the us fund archstone multifamily partners ac jv lp the ac jv and brandywine apartments of maryland llc brandywine 

the us fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested the us fund owns nine  communities containing 1730  apartment homes one of which includes a marina containing 229  boat slips through subsidiaries we acquired and own the general partner of the fund and hold a 286  interest in the fund 

the ac jv is a joint venture in which we acquired archstones 200  ownership interest the ac jv was formed in 2011 and owns three  operating apartment communities containing 921  apartment homes one of which completed development in 2014  the ac jv partnership agreement contains provisions that require us to provide a right of first offer rofo to the ac jv in connection with additional opportunities to acquire or develop additional interests in multifamily real estate assets within a specified geographic radius of the existing assets generally one mile or less the rofo restriction expires in 2019 

brandywine owns a 305  apartment home community located in washington dc which is managed by a third party brandywine is comprised of five  members who hold various interests in the joint venture in conjunction with the archstone acquisition we acquired a 261 equity interest in the venture and subsequently purchased an additional 26 interest and as of december 31 2014  hold a 287  equity interest in the venture 

a more detailed description of fund i fund ii the us fund and the ac jv collectively the funds brandywine and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 6 investments in real estate entities of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

through subsidiaries the company and equity residential entered into three limited liability company agreements collectively the “residual jv” through which the company and equity residential acquired i certain assets of archstone that the company and equity residential plan to divest to third parties or to the company or equity residential over time the “residual assets” and ii various liabilities of archstone that the company and equity residential agreed to assume in conjunction with the archstone acquisition the “residual liabilities” the residual assets currently include a 200  interest in lake mendota investments llc and subsidiaries swib a joint venture which currently owns and manages four  apartment communities with 1410  apartment homes in the united states two  land parcels and various licenses insurance policies contracts office leases and other miscellaneous assets the residual liabilities include most existing or future litigation and claims related to archstone’s operations for periods before the close of the archstone acquisition except for i claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by the company or equity residential which generally remain the sole responsibility of the company or equity residential as applicable and ii certain tax and other litigation between archstone and various equity holders in archstone related to periods before the close of the archstone acquisition and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of archstone that occurred prior to closing for which lehman has agreed to indemnify the company and equity residential the company and equity residential jointly control the residual jv and the company holds a 400  economic interest in the assets and liabilities of the residual jv 

including sales by unconsolidated entities and entities in which we held a residual profits interest and excluding the sale of indirect interests associated with the residual jv during 2014  we sold 12  operating communities and recognized a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap of  181557000  we also recognized income of 60534000  representing our promoted interests in certain of the unconsolidated ventures disposed of in 2014 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

 3 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 communities in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term development is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to construction refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phases 

throughout this report the term redevelopment is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as reconstruction which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired 14 assets that were contributed by third parties on a taxdeferred basis to an archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests to protect the taxdeferred nature of the contribution the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling or repaying secured financing on the contributed assets as of december 31 2014  the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would be triggered by the sale of all 14 contributed assets is estimated to be approximately 44000000  

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income noi 

we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

 onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the noi produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner from time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing andor maintenance activity at one or more of our communities 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a taxable reit subsidiary which is a subsidiary that is treated as a c corporation subject to federal income taxes see tax matters below 

financing strategy we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1300000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the credit facility sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2014  we had a total of 625798  square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under construction gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2014  was 17894000   11  of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail component of a mixeduse building that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code or the treasury regulations thereunder our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions such as those described under property management strategy above we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a risk factors 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 8 

 costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as taxexempt bonds and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2014  approximately 60  of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily business we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are currently implementing two new brands of communities that target various customer preferences we cannot assure that these brands will be successful or that our costs in developing and implementing these brands will result in incremental revenue and earnings 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 communities—other land and real estate assets in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

we are exposed to various risks from our real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

we are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds  

we formed fund i and fund ii in which we have an equity interest of 152  and 313  and as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired equity interests in the us fund and the ac jv of 286  and 200  respectively which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and managing member and in which at december 31 2014  we have an aggregate equity investment excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of each respective fund of approximately 250024000  net of distributions to us the investment periods for fund i fund ii and the us fund are over and fund i has a term that expires in march 2015 the funds present risks including the following 

 the governance provisions of our joint ventures with equity residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities  

in connection with the archstone acquisition we created joint ventures with equity residential that manage certain of the acquired assets and liabilities these structures involve participation in the ventures by equity residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate including the risk that equity residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures under the form for the joint venture arrangements neither we nor equity residential expect to individually have the sole power to control the ventures and an impasse could occur which could adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition andor reputation 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including among others engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis we also maintain cyber risk insurance to cover certain risks arising out of data and network breaches 

however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities and penalties 

we are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage including risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

earthquake risk as further described in item 2 communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical 

severe or inclement weather risk particularly in new england and the metro new yorknew jersey area we are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including hurricanes severe winter storms and coastal flooding severe or inclement weather may result in increased costs such as losses and costs resulting from repair of water and wind damage removal of snow and ice and in the case of our development communities delays in construction that result in increased construction costs and delays in realizing rental revenues from a community in addition severe or inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance of our communities 

where we have a geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe that affects a region such as an earthquake that affects the west coast or a hurricane or severe winter storm that affects the midatlantic metro new yorknew jersey or new england regions may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

terrorism risk   we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metro new yorknew jersey and washington dc markets that have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of these substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge these laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties we currently do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of vapor intrusion at our communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may through our taxable reit subsidiaries hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to us tax as regular corporations the archstone acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

 item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities and exclude communities owned by the residual jv while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year 

the following is a description of each category 

current communities  are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 development communities  are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights  are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community or where we are the designated developer in a publicprivate partnership we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases 

as of december 31 2014  communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in excluding indirect interests associated with the residual jv were classified as follows 



 

 our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually determined as of january 1 of each of the respective years the established communities portfolio for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  had 23  19  and 11  communities added respectively and six  seven  and 17  communities removed respectively the company removes a community from its established communities portfolio for the upcoming year and then generally maintains that designation if the company believes that planned activity for a community for the upcoming year will result in that communitys expected operations not being comparable to the prior year period the company believes that a communitys expected operations will not be comparable to the prior year period when it intends either i to undertake a significant capital renovation of the community such that the company would consider the community to be classified as a redevelopment community or ii to dispose of a community through a sale or other disposition transaction for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  the company removed four  five  and 10  communities respectively from its established communities portfolio due to a reclassification to the redevelopment community portfolio on account of then current or expected redevelopment and removed two  two  and seven  communities respectively from its established communities portfolio due to the planned disposition of the communities 

effective april 1 2014 the company updated its operating segments primarily to include communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition in the results of operations of our established community portfolio for the balance of the year the established communities portfolio as of december 31 2014  added 43 stabilized communities to the established communities portfolio primarily those acquired as part of the archstone acquisition and removed one community from our established communities portfolio effective january 1 2014 due to a reclassification to the redevelopment community portfolio 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings as of january 31 2015  our current communities consisted of 142  gardenstyle of which 16  are mixed communities andor include town homes 21  highrise and 89  midrise apartment communities 

our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features which may include 

 other features at various communities may include 

 as described in item 1 business we operate under three core brands avalon ava  and eaves by avalon  our core avalon  brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services ava  targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus eaves by avalon  is targeted to the cost conscious value segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents  helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities excluding indirect interests associated with the residual jv are located in the following geographic markets 



 

 we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2014  we completed construction of 4121  apartment homes in 17  communities and sold 3234  apartment homes in 12  communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 195 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 131 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2015  we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

 20 

for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for certain of the land leases for which we have an absolute ownership interest that expire in october 2026 november 2028 and april 2095 

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 24 of the 26  development communities and a leasehold interest in two  of the development communities with the land leases expiring in december 2086 and november 2106 the land lease expiring in 2086 provides an option for the company to purchase the land at some point during the lease term 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2015  there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes

development communities 

as of december 31 2014  we had 26  development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 8524  apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 3011000000  in addition the land for two  development communities that we control under longterm land lease agreements is subject to future minimum rental amounts of approximately 7704000  in 2015  in the aggregate we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations including the factors identified under forwardlooking statements for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities unless otherwise noted in the table 



 

 32 

 during the year ended december 31 2014  the company completed the development of the following communities 



 

 33 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2014  there were eight  communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 131700000  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 



 

 development rights 

at december 31 2014  we had 180516000  in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own and 67029000  in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through an option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 37  development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2014  includes 144099000  in original land acquisition costs the original land acquisition cost per home ranged from 24000  per home in connecticut  to 74000  per home in new york  the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 10384  apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 24  development rights we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land for the 13  remaining development rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2014  we incurred a charge of approximately 3964000  for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 

you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the following presents a summary of these development rights 



 

 land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2014  we acquired land parcels for 12  development rights as shown in the table below for an aggregate investment of approximately 139685000  



 

 in january 2015 we acquired land for 325000000  associated with three  development rights located in new york ny and bellevue wa if developed as expected the development rights related to this land will contain 910  apartment homes for a projected total capital cost of 509717000  

other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately 20941000  which we do not currently plan to develop these parcels consist of i land that we originally planned to develop and ii ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop we believe that the current carrying value for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

disposition activity 

we i sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2014 to january 31 2015  we sold our interest in five  whollyowned communities containing 1660  apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 411700000  

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured and selfinsured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 150000000 of coverage earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a 175000000 limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate in california the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building with a maximum of 25000000 per loss our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 350000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional selfinsured retention until the total incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1500000 we selfinsure a portion of our primary property insurance which includes the earthquake risks 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program congress reauthorized tripra in january 2015 for six years we have also purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 400000000 including insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides terrorism coverage through tripra subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors  we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 30000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property this amount may not be sufficient to cover losses that may be in excess of the policy limits 

edgewater casualty loss 

in january 2015 a fire occurred at our avalon at edgewater apartment community located in edgewater new jersey edgewater edgewater consisted of two residential buildings one building which contained 240 apartment homes was destroyed and is uninhabitable the second building which contains 168 apartment homes has been reoccupied and we currently believe it only suffered minimal damage we are currently assessing our direct losses resulting from the fire which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild as well as our liability to third parties who incurred damages on account of the fire to date a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us including three purported class actions while we currently believe that our direct losses and liability to third parties will be substantially covered by our insurance policies including coverage for the replacement cost of the building third party claims and business interruption loss subject to deductibles as well as a selfinsured portion of the property insurance for which we are obligated for 12 of the first 50000000 in losses we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter 

as of december 31 2014 edgewater was encumbered with a fixedrate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 595 and an outstanding principal balance of 75012000 due in may 2019 the “edgewater mortgage” the edgewater mortgage stipulates that in the event of a casualty loss such as the edgewater fire the lender has absolute discretion to determine the disposition of the insurance proceeds and can compel us i to direct the insurance proceeds to be used for the restoration of edgewater or ii to apply the insurance proceeds to repay the outstanding loan balance at par as of the date of this form 10k we are complying with all lender requirements and are working with the lender to resolve open issues related to the edgewater mortgage 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as discussed immediately above in january 2015 a fire occurred at the companys avalon at edgewater apartment community in edgewater nj the company is aware that third parties including residents suffered significant property damage and other losses such as relocation costs associated with the fire but the company is not aware of any persons who suffered major personal injury to date a number of lawsuits have been filed on behalf of edgewater residents including the following three purported class actions demarco and bayer et al v avalonbay communities inc et al  and gutierrez v avalonbay communities inc et al  each filed in the united states district court for the district of new jersey and loposky and kemp et al v avalonbay communities inc et al filed in the superior court of new jersey bergen county  law division while the company currently believes that subject to applicable deductibles all of its liability to third parties resulting from the fire will be substantially covered by its insurance policies the company can give no assurances in this regard and continues to evaluate this matter 

the company is involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given the company does not currently believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

executive overview 

business description 

we develop redevelop acquire own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle and shorter lease terms allow for a better ability to take advantage of inflationary environments we focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life we believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior riskadjusted returns on apartment community investment relative to other markets we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 

our strategy is to be leaders in market research and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming submarkets of the united states our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

financial highlights 

for the year ended december 31 2014  net income attributable to common stockholders was 683567000  an increase of 330426000  or 936  over the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in income from unconsolidated real estate entities resulting from the gains on sales of communities in various ventures including the company’s promoted interests increased noi from newly developed and acquired communities losses on an interest rate contract in the prior year not present in 2014 a decrease in expensed acquisition costs related to the archstone acquisition and a decrease in depreciation expense related to inplace leases acquired as part of the archstone acquisition 

for the year ended december 31 2014  established communities noi increased by 22961000  or 35  over the prior year the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 39  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 49  over 2013  for purposes of the discussion in the mda our established communities include those communities which we owned and had stabilized occupancy as of january 1 2013 and therefore does not include communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition 

during 2014  we raised approximately 1154220000  of gross capital through the issuance of common equity and unsecured notes borrowing on the term loan and asset sales exclusive of proceeds from the disposition of joint ventures the funds raised from asset sales consist of the proceeds from the sale of four  communities and one  parcel of land for gross sales proceeds of 304250000  in addition in january 2015 we sold one community avalon on stamford harbor located in stamford ct for 115500000  we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value we increased development activity during 2014  from the prior year in anticipation of continued favorable economic conditions and apartment fundamentals during 2014  we completed the development of 17  communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 1134300000  we also started the development of 14  communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 1342800000  in addition during 2014  we completed the redevelopment of five  communities for a total investment of 53000000  excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets and financial flexibility we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility and term loan secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt preferred equity andor common equity including common equity issued pursuant to the forward the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we acquired avalon mission oaks located in camarillo ca avalon mission oaks contains 160  apartment homes and was acquired for a purchase price of 47000000  

during the year ended december 31 2014  we sold four  communities containing an aggregate of 1337  apartment homes for an aggregate gross sales price of 296200000  and an aggregate gain in accordance with gaap of 106138000  during 2014  we also sold a land parcel in huntington station ny for 8050000  resulting in a gain in accordance with gaap of 490000  

during the year ended december 31 2014  three of the companys joint ventures excluding the residual jv sold operating communities 

 in conjunction with the disposition of these communities the respective ventures repaid 224178000  of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates this resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and a write off of deferred financing costs of which the company’s portion was approximately 2339000  and was reported as a reduction of equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities

as discussed under item 2 communities — insurance and risk of uninsured losses — edgewater casualty loss in january 2015 a fire occurred at edgewater the company is currently assessing its direct losses resulting from the fire which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild as well its liability to third parties who incurred damages on account of the fire 

communities overview 

as of december 31 2014  excluding indirect interests associated with the residual jv we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 277  apartment communities containing 82487  apartment homes in 11  states and the district of columbia of which 26  communities were under construction and eight  communities were under reconstruction of these communities 24  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including 10  owned by subsidiaries of fund ii and nine  owned by the us fund in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 37  whollyowned communities that if developed as expected will contain an estimated 10384  apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities development communities and development rights our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities to be compared between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 segment reporting of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found in liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2014  2013  and 2012  follows dollars in thousands 



 

 

net income attributable to common stockholders  increased 330426000  or 936  to 683567000  in 2014  primarily due to an increase in income from unconsolidated real estate entities resulting from the gains on sales of communities in various ventures including the company’s promoted interests increased noi from newly developed and acquired communities losses on an interest rate contract in the prior year not present in 2014 a decrease in expensed acquisition costs related to the archstone acquisition and a decrease in depreciation expense related to inplace leases acquired as part of the archstone acquisition net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 70728000  or 167  in 2013  from 2012  primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense and expensed transaction costs associated with the archstone acquisition coupled with the recognition of losses on an interest rate contract the decrease was partially offset by an increase in noi from communities acquired in the archstone acquisition and our existing and newly developed communities in 2013 as well as an increase in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year 

noi  is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excluding corporatelevel income including management development and other fees corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management expenses expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net interest expense gain loss on extinguishment of debt general and administrative expense joint venture income loss depreciation expense casualty loss impairment loss on land holdings gain on sale of real estate assets income from discontinued operations and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale not classified as discontinued operations 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



 

 47 

the noi increases for both 2014  and 2013  as compared to the prior year consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



the increase in our established communities noi in 2014  is due to increased rental rates partially offset by decreased economic occupancy and increased operating expenses the increase in 2013  is due to increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy partially offset by increased operating expenses 

rental and other income  increased in both 2014  and 2013  as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities including those acquired in the archstone acquisition in 2013 and an increase in rental rates and economic occupancy in 2013 at our established communities 

overall portfolio—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 61686  apartment homes for 2014  as compared to 57240  homes for 2013  and 43411  homes for 2012  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2254  for 2014  as compared to 2171  in 2013  and 2017  in 2012  

established communities—rental revenue increased 36096000  or 39  to 963917000  for 2014 from 927821000  in the prior year the increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 40  to 2273  per apartment home partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 01  to 960  rental revenue increased 34749000  or 43  for 2013  as compared to the prior year economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions except the midatlantic in 2014  as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region which accounted for approximately 330  of the established community rental revenue for 2014  experienced an increase in rental revenue of 34  for 2014  as compared to 2013  as a result of an increase in average rental rates to 2680  per apartment home economic occupancy remained consistent at 964  for 2014  as compared to 2013  apartment demand in the metro new yorknew jersey region is being driven by job growth across a diverse group of industries including healthcare professional business services technology retail hospitality and education we expect to see continued growth in the metro new yorknew jersey region in 2015 new york city is beginning to see a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries but suburban markets surrounding the city are more insulated from this new competition 

the new england region accounted for approximately 186  of the established community rental revenue for 2014  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 25  over the prior year average rental rates increased 29  to 2189  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 04  decrease in economic occupancy to 953  for 2014  as compared to 2013  accelerating employment growth in the medical education and technology fields is supporting apartment demand in the boston metro area the fairfield market continues to experience moderate economic growth due to the area’s greater exposure to the financial services sector which has experienced slower job growth during this recovery than other industries 

the northern california region accounted for approximately 181  of the established community rental revenue for 2014  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 77  over the prior year average rental rates increased 76  to 2524  per apartment home and economic occupancy increased 01  to 963  for 2014  as compared to 2013  while new apartment supply may slow revenue growth in future periods we expect the strength in the technology industry to continue to fuel demand for apartment homes in 2015 

the southern california region accounted for approximately 145  of the established community rental revenue for 2014  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 46  over the prior year average rental rates increased 47  to 1873  per apartment home and were partially offset by a 01  decrease in economic occupancy to 962  for 2014  as compared to 2013  southern california has seen steady job growth and limited new apartment supply which we expect will continue to support favorable operating results in 2015 

the midatlantic region which represented approximately 102  of the established community rental revenue during 2014  experienced a decrease in rental revenue of 05  as compared to 2013  average rental rates decreased by 02  to 1969  per apartment home and economic occupancy decreased 03  to 955  for 2014  as compared to 2013  a combination of elevated levels of new apartment deliveries and job growth slightly below the expected national average are expected to challenge the region’s apartment fundamentals for 2015 

the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 56  of the established community rental revenue for 2014  and experienced a rental revenue increase of 59  over the prior year average rental rates increased 62  to 1824  and were partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 03  to 954  for 2014  as compared to 2013  the region’s online retail technology and manufacturing sectors continue to support growth in the economy and apartment fundamentals rental revenue growth may be tempered in 2015 by the delivery of new apartment homes particularly in the urban core of seattle 

management development and other fees  decreased 452000  or 39  in 2014  and increased 1245000  or 121  in 2013  as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from fund i and fund ii partially offset by increased property and asset management fees related to the archstone acquisition and related private real estate investment management funds the us fund and the ac jv the increase in 2013 was primarily due to increased property and asset management fees related to the archstone acquisition and related private real estate investment management funds the us fund and the ac jv partially offset by lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from fund i and fund ii 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes  increased 50696000  or 172  and 84064000  or 398  in 2014  and 2013  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment homes including the communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition in february 2013 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 7475000  or 40  and 4374000  or 26  in 2014  and 2013  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance utilities and payroll costs 

property taxes  increased 19860000  or 125  and 61219000  or 628  in 2014  and 2013  respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the net impact of the communities acquired in the archstone acquisition as well as the addition of newly developed apartment communities coupled with increased tax rates and assessments across our portfolio the increase in 2014 was partially offset by reductions in expected supplemental billings related to communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition 

for established communities property taxes increased 6206000  or 67  and 4282000  or 54  in 2014  and 2013  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher rates and assessments as well as refunds received in the prior year in excess of the current year period the increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher rates and assessments partially offset by higher successful appeals and refunds received in 2013 as compared to the prior year for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 massachusetts also has laws that limit property tax increases we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses  increased 7236000  or 136  and 10912000  or 259  in 2014  and 2013  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related costs coupled with increased activities related to rebranding and corporate initiatives as well as increases associated with the archstone acquisition the increase in 2013 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs as well as the increase in corporatelevel personnel and expenses associated with the archstone acquisition 

investments and investment management  costs increased 495000  or 124  in 2014  and decreased by 2081000  or 343  in 2013  as compared to the prior years the increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in compensation costs partially offset by a decline in our investment fund management activity the decrease in 2013 was primarily due to reductions in compensation costs related to the relative decrease in our investment fund management activity 

expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs net of recoveries  primarily reflect the costs incurred related to our asset investment activity abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits offset by any recoveries associated with acquisitions for periods prior to our ownership these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period these costs decreased 48767000  in 2014  and increased 33700000  or 2969  in 2013  as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to receipts related to communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition for periods prior to the company’s ownership which are primarily comprised of property tax and mortgage insurance refunds the increase in 2013 over the prior year is due primarily to costs associated with the archstone acquisition 

interest expense net  increased 8216000  or 48  and 35482000  or 259  in 2014  and 2013  respectively as compared to the prior years this category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development activity amortization of the mark to market adjustment on debt assumed as part of the archstone acquisition and interest income the increase in 2014 was primarily due to increased unsecured debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to our increased development activity the increase in 2013 was primarily due to net interest costs on debt assumed in the archstone acquisition partially offset by increased capitalized interest related to our increased development activity 

loss on the extinguishment of debt net  reflects   prepayment penalties the expensing of deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired excluding costs related to debt secured by assets sold or held for sale 

loss on interest rate contract  reflects the loss recorded by the company related to the forward interest rate protection agreement that matured in may 2013 based on changes in the companys capital markets outlook in 2013 the company did not issue the anticipated debt for which the interest rate protection agreement was transacted 

depreciation expense  decreased 117533000  or 210  in 2014  and increased 316535000  or 1299  in 2013  as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of amortization for lease intangibles in 2013 not present in 2014 from communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition the increase in 2013 was primarily due to additional depreciation expense from the archstone acquisition consisting largely of the depreciation of inplace lease intangibles which were depreciated over a six month period 

general and administrative expense  ga increased 1852000  or 47  and 5472000  or 160  in 2014  and 2013  respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense partially offset by legal recoveries in 2014 not present in the prior year the increase in 2013 over 2012 was primarily due to increased compensation costs including costs related to the archstone acquisition 

casualty and impairment loss  for 2012 consists of the losses we incurred associated with superstorm sandy 

equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities  increased by 159920000  in 2014  and decreased 32068000  in 2013  as compared to the prior years the increase in 2014 was primarily due to gains on the sales of communities in various ventures including the companys promoted interests coupled with certain expensed transaction costs associated with the archstone acquisition that were incurred in 2013 through the unconsolidated joint venture entities owned with equity residential that were not present in 2014 the decrease in 2013 is primarily due to costs of approximately 39543000 associated with the archstone acquisition that were incurred through the unconsolidated joint venture entities owned with equity residential during the year 

gain on sale of land  increased in 2014  and decreased 2013  as compared to the prior years due to changes in volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels 

gain on sale of communities  increased in 2014  over 2013  due to our implementation of new accounting guidance under asu 201408 effective january 1 2014 which impacted where we report income from operations as well as gains or losses from the disposition of operating communities gain on disposition for communities classified as held for sale subsequent to the adoption of the guidance is presented as part of this line item for communities classified as held for sale prior to our adoption of asu 201408 gain on sale is presented as gain on sale of discontinued operations 

gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity for 2012 represents the amount by which the fair value of our prior ownership interest in the joint venture that owned avalon del rey exceeded our carrying value 

income tax expense  for 2014 consists of federal income tax expense related to dispositions of the companys direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the archstone acquisition which were owned through a taxable reit subsidiary 

income from discontinued operations  represents the net income generated by real estate sold and qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2012 through december 31 2014  income from discontinued operations decreased in 2014  and 2013  as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2014 was due to the change in accounting guidance for discontinued operations under asu 201408 with individual community dispositions no longer classified as such the decrease in 2013 was due to changes in the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area as compared to the prior year see note 7 real estate disposition activities to our consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of discontinued operations decreased in 2014  and increased in 2013  as compared to the prior years the amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area after our adoption of asu 201408 as of january 1 2014 gain on sale of communities is presented as gain on sale of communities 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  resulted in an allocation of income of 13760000  in 2014  and an allocation of loss of 370000  and 307000  in 2013  and 2012  respectively the amount for 2014 includes our joint venture partners 848 interest in the gain on the sale of a fund i community that was consolidated for financial reporting purposes in the amount of 14132000 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

in 2015  we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources which may include the physical settlement of the forward real estate dispositions cash balances on hand borrowing capacity under our credit facility andor the term loan secured and unsecured debt financings and other public or private sources of liquidity including the issuance of common and preferred equity as well as cash generated from our operating activities our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects capital raising activities in 2014  included asset sales the term loan entered into in march the issuance of common stock under cep iii as defined below and the issuance of unsecured notes in november 

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 509460000  at december 31 2014  an increase of 228105000  from 281355000  at december 31 2013  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 886641000  in 2014  from 724315000  in 2013  the increase was driven primarily by increased noi from existing and newly developed communities a decrease in acquisition costs and the timing of payments of corporate obligations 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities of 816760000  in 2014  is related to investments in assets primarily through development and redevelopment partially offset by proceeds received for dispositions and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures in 2014  we invested 1341657000  in the following areas 

 51 

we received proceeds from dispositions of 297466000  and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures in the amount of 203945000  associated primarily with the disposition of communities from cvp i llc fund i and fund ii 

financing activities—net cash provided by financing activities totaled 158224000  in 2014  the net cash provided is due to 

 these amounts are partially offset by 

 variable rate unsecured credit facility 

the company has a 1300000000  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility which matures in april 2017 we may extend the maturity for up to one  year through the exercise of two  six  month extension options for an aggregate fee of 1950000  the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor  plus 105   122  at january 31 2015  assuming a one month borrowing rate the annual facility fee is 015  or approximately 1950000  annually based on the 1300000000  facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 47963000  outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2015  

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility the term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the principal financial covenants include the following 

 we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2014  

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in august 2012 we commenced a third continuous equity program cep iii under which we are authorized by our board of directors to sell up to 750000000  of shares of our common stock from time to time during a 36 month period in conjunction with cep iii we have engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 15  of the gross sales price for shares sold during the year ended december 31 2014  we sold 2069538  shares at an average sales price of 14495  per share for net proceeds of 295465000  as of january 31 2015  we had 346304000  of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program 

forward equity contract 

on september 9 2014 based on a market closing price of 15583 per share on that date we entered into a forward contract to sell 4500000 shares of common stock for an initial forward price of 15174 per share net of offering fees and discounts the forward the sales price and proceeds achieved will be determined on the date or dates of settlement with adjustments during the term of the contract for our dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varies with changes in the fed funds rate we generally have the ability to determine the dates and method of settlement subject to certain conditions and the right of the forward counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances settlement may be i physical sale of shares of our common stock for cash ii net cash settlement whereby we will either pay or receive the difference between the forward price and the weighted average market price for our common stock at the time of settlement or iii net share settlement whereby we will either receive or issue shares of our common stock with the number of shares issued or received determined by the difference between the forward price and the weighted average market price for its common stock at the time of settlement the forward price and the weighted average market price would in both cases by determined under the applicable terms of the forward under either of the net settlement provisions we will pay to the counterparty either cash or shares of common stock when the weighted average market price of our common stock at the time of settlement exceeds the forward and will receive either cash or issue shares of common stock to the extent that the weighted average market price of our common stock at the time of settlement is less than the price under the forward settlement of the forward will occur on one or more dates not later than september 8 2015 

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at maturity for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility or term loan although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following debt activity occurred during 2014  

 the following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2014  dollars in thousands as compared to the amounts of debt outstanding as of at december 31 2013  we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest

 future financing and capital needs—portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2014  we had 26  whollyowned communities under construction and eight  whollyowned communities under reconstruction substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

 before planned construction or reconstruction activity including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures begins or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

fund i fund ii and the us fund collectively the “funds” were established to engage in real estate acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds and iii additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund i has nine  institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i has a 152  combined general partner and limited partner equity interest and has fully recovered its basis as of december 31 2014  with any additional liquidation proceeds to be recognized in earnings as received fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i has a term that expires in march 2015 in 2014 fund i sold its final four  apartment communities 

fund ii has six  institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund ii we have an equity investment of 92162000  net of distributions representing a 313  combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in august 2011 fund ii has a term that expires in august 2020 assuming the exercise of two oneyear extension options 

the us fund has six  institutional investors including us we are the general partner of the us fund and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the us fund we have an equity investment of 88220000  net of distributions representing a 286  combined equity interest the us fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested the us fund has a term that expires in july 2023 assuming the exercise of two oneyear extension options we acquired our interest in the us fund as part of the archstone acquisition 

in addition as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired an interest in the ac jv which has four  institutional investors including us excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the ac jv we have an equity investment of 69633000  net of distributions representing a 200  equity interest the ac jv was formed in 2011 

as of december 31 2014  we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting refer to note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table dollars in thousands

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 investments in real estate entities of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 in addition as part of the formation of fund ii we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee the guarantee provides that if upon final liquidation of fund ii the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of fund ii whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall but in no event more than 10  of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately 8910000  as of december 31 2014  as of december 31 2014  the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by fund ii is considered adequate to cover the guaranteed distribution amount to that partner under the expected fund ii liquidation scenario the estimated fair value of and our obligation under this guarantee both at inception and as of december 31 2014  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december 31 2014  

each individual mortgage loan of fund ii was made to a special purpose single asset subsidiary of fund ii each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only except under exceptional circumstances such as fraud or misapplication of funds in which case fund ii could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan in no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in fund ii including against us or our whollyowned subsidiaries that invest in fund ii a default by fund ii or a fund ii subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other nonfund subsidiaries or affiliates if fund ii or a subsidiary of fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan the value of our investment in fund ii would likely decline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to fund ii partners as described above if a fund ii subsidiary or fund ii were unable to meet its obligations under a loan we andor the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support fund ii through additional equity contributions andor take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default such as foreclosure of a fund ii asset 

in the future in the event fund ii was unable to meet its obligations under a loan we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support or take any other action as any such action would depend on a variety of factors including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of fund ii andor our returns by providing time for performance to improve 

 59 

 in january 2015 we received 20700000  from the joint venture partner associated with mvp i llc upon agreement to modify the joint venture agreement to eliminate our promoted interest for future return calculations and associated distributions prospectively earnings and distributions will be based on the companys 250  equity interest in the venture 

 there are no other material lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest 

contractual obligations 

scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2014  dollars in thousands 



 

 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains forwardlooking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words believe expect anticipate intend estimate assume project plan may shall will and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a risk factors in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following

 critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 organization and basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method excluding joint venture entities the company formed with equity residential as part of the archstone acquisition at december 31 2014  our assets would have increased by 1391602000  and our liabilities would have increased by 1005012000  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 62 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue we defer costs associated with originating new leases recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any projectspecific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 37433000  38128000  and 26513000  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2014  our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our costs charged to expense would have increased by 3743000  

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2014  would have decreased by 6703000  

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property we assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 

we expense costs related to abandoned pursuits which include the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2014  our net income would have decreased by approximately 274794000  

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 

acquisition of investments in real estate 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement which requires the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value typical assets and liabilities acquired include land building furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovebelow market leases and inplace leases in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 1297461000  and 1011609000  respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2014  and 2013  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 13035000  and 9680000  respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years in 2013 in conjunction with the archstone acquisition we assumed approximately 2034482000  secured fixed and floating rate indebtedness which impacted the companys overall exposure to interest rate risk in may 2013 a 215000000  forward interest rate protection agreement matured resulting in a payment to the counterparty of 51000000  the fair value at time of settlement 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 6448138000  at december 31 2014  had an estimated aggregate fair value of 6558022000  at december 31 2014  contractual fixed rate debt represented 5443736000  of the fair value at december 31 2014  if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2014  the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 365417000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the company which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities located primarily in high barrier to entry markets of the united states these barriers to entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our primary markets are located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states we focus on these markets because we believe that over the longterm a limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in higher growth in cash flows relative to other markets 

at january 31 2014 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

• 244 operating apartment communities containing 72811 apartment homes in twelve states and the district of columbia of which 214 communities containing 63514 apartment homes were consolidated for financial reporting purposes three communities containing 979 apartment homes were held by joint ventures in which we hold an ownership interest and 27 communities containing 8318 apartment homes were owned by the funds as defined below three of the consolidated communities containing 1126 apartment homes were under redevelopment as discussed below • 29 whollyowned communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of 8708 apartment homes when completed including one community in which we had an indirect interest expected to contain 103 apartment homes and • rights to develop an additional 46 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 12986 apartment homes and • an indirect interest in a joint venture formed with equity residential as defined in this form 10k which owns direct and indirect interests in assets acquired as part of the archstone acquisition including a direct interest in apartment communities in germany an indirect interest in a joint venture which owns six apartment communities with 1902 apartment homes in the united states and two land parcels we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 segment reporting of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartment communities in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire an interest in apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital our strategy is to be leaders in multifamily market research consumer insight and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming us submarkets a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava and eaves by avalon we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint the avalon brand is our core offering focusing on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services in urban and suburban markets our ava brand is designed for people who want to live in or near urban neighborhoods and in close proximity to public transportation services shopping and nightlife ava apartments are generally smaller many engineered for roommate living and feature modern design and a technology focus our eaves by avalon brand is designed for renters who seek good quality apartment living often in a suburban setting with practical amenities and services at a more modest price point 

during the three years ended december 31 2013 excluding activity for the funds as defined below we acquired 59 apartment communities of which 54 were acquired as part of the archstone acquisition as defined in this form 10k in addition in conjunction with the archstone acquisition excluding investments in joint ventures formed with equity residential we acquired interests in three unconsolidated joint ventures as discussed below which own an aggregate of 12 apartment communities during the three years ended december 31 2013 we disposed of 15 apartment communities four of which were acquired in the archstone acquisition and completed the development of 26 apartment communities and the redevelopment of 24 apartment communities during 2012 we also purchased our joint venture partners interest in one operating community obtaining a 100 ownership interest in that apartment community in addition in 2011 we exchanged a portfolio of three communities and a parcel of land we owned for a portfolio of six communities and 26000000 in cash in addition we sold one community in 2014 through the date this form 10k was filed 

in march 2005 we formed avalonbay value added fund lp fund i a private discretionary real estate investment vehicle which we manage and in which we own a 152 interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i acquired 20 communities during the three years ended december 31 2013 we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of 16 communities owned by fund i 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp fund ii a second institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 313 interest in 2012 fund ii acquired its final operating community which was an active acquisition candidate as of august 2011 the end of the investment period for fund ii from the commencement of fund ii through the close of the investment period fund ii acquired 13 operating communities during the three years ended december 31 2013 we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of one community owned by fund ii 

in conjunction with the archstone acquisition excluding joint ventures formed with equity residential we acquired interests in three additional joint ventures brandywine apartments of maryland llc brandywine archstone multifamily partners ac lp the us fund and multifamily partners ac jv lp the ac jv 

brandywine owns a 305 apartment home community located in washington dc which is managed by a third party brandywine is comprised of five members who hold various interests in the joint venture in conjunction with the archstone acquisition we acquired a 261 equity interest in the venture and subsequently purchased an additional 26 interest and as of december 31 2013 hold a 287 equity interest in the venture 

the us fund was formed in july 2011 and is fully invested the us fund owns nine communities containing 1726 apartment homes one of which includes a marina containing 229 boat slips through subsidiaries we acquired and own the general partner of the fund and hold a 286 interest in the fund 

the ac jv is a joint venture in which we acquired archstones 20 ownership interest the ac jv was formed in 2011 and owns two operating apartment communities containing 818 apartment homes in cambridge ma and herndon va and one development community which if completed as expected will contain 103 apartment homes in cambridge ma the ac jv partnership agreement contains provisions that require us to provide a right of first offer rofo to the ac jv in connection with additional opportunities to acquire or develop additional interests in multifamily real estate assets within a specified geographic radius of the existing assets generally one mile or less we own one land parcel for the development of 301 apartment homes classified as a development right in cambridge ma acquired as part of the archstone acquisition that is subject to the rofo restrictions the rofo restriction expires in 2019 

a more detailed description of fund i fund ii the us fund and the ac jv collectively the funds brandywine and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 6 investments in real estate entities of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

including sales by unconsolidated entities and entities in which we held a residual profits interest during 2013 we sold 16 operating communities and recognized a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap of 292684000 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices including offices that are in or near the following cities 

• boston massachusetts • long island new york • los angeles california • new york new york • newport beach california • san francisco california • san jose california • seattle washington • fairfield connecticut • virginia beach virginia and • woodbridge new jersey after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 communities in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities and certain development communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income any expenses relating to these operations in excess of any rents received are accounted for as a reduction in net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for 

third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term development is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to construction refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have a dedicated group of associates and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phases 

throughout this report the term redevelopment is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as reconstruction which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

we acquired 16 assets in the archstone acquisition for which outstanding third parties retained an indirect interest with associated tax protection rights which may be triggered if we sell the assets or repay secured financing thereon if triggered upon a sale of all 16 assets the associated tax protection payments are estimated to be approximately 44 million at december 31 2013 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income noi we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

• focusing on resident satisfaction • staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are better matched to traffic patterns 5 

• balancing high occupancy with premium pricing and increasing rents as market conditions permit and • employing revenue management software to optimize the pricing and term of leases constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

• we use purchase order controls acquiring goods and services from preapproved vendors • we use national negotiated contracts and also purchase supplies in bulk where possible • we bid thirdparty contracts on a volume basis • we strive to retain residents through high levels of service in order to eliminate the cost of preparing an apartment home for a new resident and to reduce marketing and vacant apartment utility costs • we perform turnover work inhouse or hire third parties generally depending upon the least costly alternative • we undertake preventive maintenance regularly to maximize resident satisfaction and property and equipment life and • we aggressively pursue real estate tax appeals onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the noi produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a taxable reit subsidiary which is a subsidiary that is treated as a c corporation subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1300000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the credit facility sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 659847 square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under construction gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2013 was 15946000 11 of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail component of a mixeduse building that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 or the treasury regulations our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

archstone acquisition 

on february 27 2013 pursuant to an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement dated november 26 2012 by and among the company equity residential and its operating partnership erp operating limited partnership together equity residential lehman brothers holdings inc lehman which term is sometimes used in this report to refer to lehman brothers holdings inc andor its relevant subsidiary or subsidiaries and archstone enterprise lp archstone which has since changed its name to jupiter enterprise lp we together with equity residential acquired directly or indirectly all of archstones assets including all of the ownership interests in joint ventures and other entities owned by archstone and assumed archstones liabilities 

both known and unknown with certain limited exceptions under the terms of the purchase agreement we acquired approximately 40 of archstones assets and liabilities and equity residential acquired approximately 60 of archstones assets and liabilities the archstone acquisition 

we acquired the following as part of the archstone acquisition 

• 54 operating apartment communities that were consolidated for financial reporting purposes containing 18423 apartment homes of which four communities containing 1368 apartment homes were subsequently disposed of during 2013 • six communities that were under construction andor in leaseup of which two have been completed with 553 homes and the other four of which are expected to be completed during 2014 and contain 1114 apartment homes • six parcels of land one of which we sold to the ac jv which is currently being developed • options to acquire two additional parcels of land of which one was acquired in 2013 and will begin construction in 2014 • interests in unconsolidated joint ventures in which we are the general partner or managing member which joint ventures own 11 apartment communities containing 2544 apartment homes and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture in which we are a limited partner which joint venture owns one apartment community containing 305 apartment homes as further discussed below and • a 40 ownership interest in unconsolidated joint venture arrangements with equity residential which will hold assets and liabilities that we and equity residential will jointly manage and that we and equity residential intend to sell to or resolve with third parties andor subsequently transfer to equity residential or to us the company provided the following consideration for the archstone acquisition 

• the issuance of 14889706 shares of the companys common stock valued at 1875210000 as of the markets close on the closing date february 27 2013 • cash payment of approximately 760000000 • the assumption of consolidated indebtedness with a fair value of approximately 3732980000 as of february 27 2013 consisting of 3512202000 principal amount of consolidated indebtedness and 220777000 representing the amount by which fair value of the aforementioned debt exceeds the principal face value 70479000 of which excess related to debt the company repaid concurrent with the archstone acquisition • the acquisition with equity residential of interests in entities that have preferred units outstanding some of which may be presented for redemption from time to time the companys 40 share of the fair value of the collective obligations including accrued dividends on these outstanding archstone preferred units as of february 27 2013 was approximately 67500000 and • the assumption with equity residential of all other liabilities known or unknown of archstone other than certain excluded liabilities the company shares 40 of the responsibility for these liabilities tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal 

and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a risk factors 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

• we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities • occupancy rates and rents at a community may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing communities • we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities • we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material labor or other costs • we may be unable to complete construction and leaseup of a community on schedule resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues • we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms or at all for the proposed development of a community which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity • we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process for example in connection with managing existing improvements on the site prior to tenant terminations and demolition such as commercial space or in connection with providing services to third parties such as the construction of shared infrastructure or other improvements and • we may incur liability if our communities are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities acts the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in imposition of fines an award of damages to private litigants and a requirement that we undertake structural modifications to remedy the noncompliance we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

• land andor property acquisition costs • fees paid to secure air rights andor tax abatements • construction or reconstruction costs 11 

• costs of environmental remediation • real estate taxes • capitalized interest and insurance • loan fees • permits • professional fees • allocated development or redevelopment overhead and • other regulatory fees costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

• plant closings industry slowdowns and other factors that adversely affect the local economy • an oversupply of or a reduced demand for apartment homes • a decline in household formation or employment or lack of employment growth • the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases • rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing that could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs and • economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses such as increases in property taxes utilities compensation of onsite associates and routine maintenance changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as taxexempt bonds and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2013 approximately 6 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank jpmorgan chase bank na as a bank and as syndication agent deutsche bank trust company americas morgan stanley bank and wells fargo bank na each as a bank and as documentation agent barclays bank plc as a bank and as codocumentation agent ubs ag stamford branch as a codocumentation agent goldman sachs bank usa the bank of new york mellon compass bank pnc bank national association and suntrust bank each as a bank and as a managing agent branch banking and trust company bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj ltd and capital one na each as a bank and as a coagent and the other bank parties signatory thereto our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt their ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the 

sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

• an acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment and • our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily business we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are currently implementing two new brands of communities that target various customer preferences we cannot assure that these brands will be successful or that our costs in developing and implementing these brands will result in incremental revenue and earnings 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 communities—other land and real estate assets in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with an investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds  

we formed fund i and fund ii in which we have an equity interest of 152 and 313 and as part of the archstone acquisition we acquired equity interests in the us fund and the ac jv of 286 and 200 respectively which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and managing member and in which at december 31 2013 we have an aggregate equity investment excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of each respective fund of approximately 270178000 net of distributions to us and excluding our purchase of a mortgage note secured by a fund i community the investment periods for fund i fund ii and the us fund are over these funds present risks including the following 

• our subsidiaries that are the general partners of the funds are generally liable under partnership law for the debts and obligations of the respective funds subject to certain exculpation and indemnification rights pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the funds • investors in the funds holding a majority of the partnership interests may remove us as the general partner without cause subject to our right to receive compensation for an additional period of management fees after such removal and our right to acquire one of the properties then held by the funds • while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds the investors or an advisory committee comprised of representatives of the investors must approve certain matters and as a result we may be unable to cause the funds to implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial and • we may be liable andor our status as a reit may be jeopardized if either the funds or the reit entities associated with the funds andor the us fund andor ac jv fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters the governance provisions of our joint ventures with equity residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities  

in connection with the archstone acquisition we created joint ventures with equity residential that manage certain of the acquired assets and liabilities these structures involve participation in the ventures by equity residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate including the risk that equity residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures under the form for the joint venture arrangements neither we nor equity residential expect to individually have the sole power to control the ventures and an impasse 

could occur which would adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any breach interruption or security failure of that technology could have a negative impact on our business operations andor financial condition 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 

we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment in addition we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us 

we address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by engaging reputable recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis we also maintain cyber risk insurance to cover certain risks arising out of data and network breaches 

however a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects including among others disruption of our business and operations disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information including personal information of our residents andor associates damage to our reputation andor potentially significant legal andor financial liabilities

as further described in item 2 communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to 

be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in new england and the metro new yorknew jersey area we are exposed to risks associated with inclement weather including increased costs related to winter weather such as costs for the removal of snow and ice repair of water and wind damage from storms as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge such laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties we currently do 

not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of vapor intrusion at our communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

• the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities • no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments • no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared • the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities such as the presence of underground storage tanks will not affect the environmental condition of our communities • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations will not result in the imposition of environmental liability and 20 

• no environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders our nonus assets may be subject to foreign taxes in addition we may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through our taxable reit subsidiaries we also use taxable reit subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable reit subsidiary our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to us tax as regular corporations the archstone acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder 

approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit our board of directors waived this ownership limit with respect to the common stock issued to lehman in connection with the archstone acquisition these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities and exclude communities in which we obtained an indirect interest through joint ventures we formed with equity residential as part of the archstone acquisition while we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis we may update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year the following is a description of each category 

  current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

• established communities also known as same store communities are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year for the year ended december 31 2013 the established communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of january 1 2012 are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of i attainment of 95 physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment • other stabilized communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in and that have stabilized occupancy as defined above other stabilized communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year • leaseup communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95 • redevelopment communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of 5000000 or 10 of the communitys preredevelopment basis and is expected to have a material impact on the operations of the community including occupancy levels and future rental rates   development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

  development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

we currently lease our corporate headquarters located in arlington virginia under an operating lease the lease term ends in 2020 subject to two five year renewal options all other regional and administrative offices are leased under operating leases 

as of december 31 2013 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 



our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 there were 19 11 and 14 communities added to the established communities portfolio respectively and 7 17 and 7 communities removed respectively we anticipate updating the composition of our established communities portfolio as of both january 1 2014 and april 1 2014 the expected april 1 2014 update is primarily to incorporate the stabilized apartment communities acquired in february 2013 as part of the archstone acquisition although we will also add previously existing assets that we owned that qualify for inclusion in our established communities portfolio as of april 1 2014 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings as of january 31 2014 our current communities consisted of 145 gardenstyle of which 16 are mixed communities andor include town homes 22 highrise and 77 midrise apartment communities 

our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features which may include 

• fullyequipped kitchens • lofts and vaulted ceilings • walkin closets • fireplaces • patiosdecks and • modern appliances other features at various communities may include 

• swimming pools • fitness centers • tennis courts and • wifi lounges as described in item 1 we operate under three core brands avalon ava and eaves by avalon our core avalon brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services ava targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus eaves by avalon is targeted to the cost conscious value segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 



we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2013 we completed construction of 4907 apartment homes in 12 communities and sold 4907 apartment homes in 16 communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 196 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 135 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2014 we owned directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries 

• a full fee simple or absolute ownership interest in 211 operating communities 11 of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in october 2026 november 2028 may 2041 december 2061 september 2065 november 2067 april 2095 may 2105 september 2105 april 2106 and march 2142 • a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in fund i fund ii the us fund and the ac jv subsidiaries of fund i own a fee simple interest in four operating communities subsidiaries of fund ii own a fee simple interest in 12 operating communities subsidiaries of the us fund own a fee simple interest in nine operating communities and subsidiaries of the ac jv own a fee simple interest in two operating communities and one development community • a general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a downreit as described more fully below that owns one community and 26 

• a membership interest in five limited liability companies that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for certain of the land leases for which we have an absolute ownership interest that expire in october 2026 november 2028 and april 2095 

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 26 of the 29 development communities and a leasehold interest in three of the development communities with the land leases expiring in july 2046 december 2086 and november 2106 two of the three land leases those expiring in 2046 and 2086 provide options for the company to purchase the land at some point during the lease term 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2014 there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes

development communities 

as of december 31 2013 we had 29 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 8708 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 2802900000 in addition the land for three development communities that we control under longterm land lease agreements is subject to future minimum rental amounts of approximately 8552000 in 2014 in the aggregate we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 





1 projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective development community determined in accordance with gaap including land acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership either during construction or upon construction completion represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount 2 future initial occupancy dates are estimates there can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments 3 stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of 95 or greater physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development 4 this development community is owned subject to a leasehold interest 5 avalon north arlington and avalon berkeley were formerly archstone branded developments 6 the company has a 20 ownership interest in this community through the ac jv 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2013 there were three communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 36800000 excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 



1 projected total capitalized cost does not include capitalized costs incurred prior to redevelopment 2 restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of 95 or greater physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of redevelopment 3 we commenced the redevelopment of ava back bay in boston ma during the first quarter of 2013 for an estimated total capitalized cost of 169 million the redevelopment of this community is primarily focused on the exterior andor common area and is not expected to have a material impact on community operations this community is therefore included in the established community portfolio and not classified as a redevelopment community 4 we assumed responsibility for the redevelopment of marina bay comprised of 205 apartment homes and 229 boat slips in conjunction with the archstone acquisition marina bay located in marina del rey ca is owned by the us fund in which we hold a 286 interest and is being redeveloped for an estimated total capitalized cost of 329 million all capital necessary for the redevelopment of marina bay was contributed to the venture prior to us acquiring an interest in the venture 

development rights 

at december 31 2013 we had 300364000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own and 31592000 in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through an option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 46 development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2013 includes 244619000 in original land acquisition costs the original land acquisition cost per home ranged from 13000 per home in massachusetts to 126000 per home in california the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 12986 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 31 development rights we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land for the 15 remaining development rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any 

or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2013 we incurred a charge of approximately 998000 for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 

you should carefully review section 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the following presents a summary of these development rights 



1 projected total capitalized cost includes all projected capitalized costs incurred to date if any and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community determined in accordance with gaap including land acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2013 we acquired land parcels for 17 development rights as shown in the table below for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 278642000 for 15 of the 17 parcels construction has either started or will start within the next 12 months 



1 projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date if any and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community determined in accordance with gaap including land and related acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees 2 we acquired these land parcels as part of the archstone acquisition maple leaf is now owned by the ac jv and is being developed north point ii is subject to a rofo in favor of the ac jv 

other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately 29839000 that we do not currently plan to develop these parcels consist of land that we i originally planned to develop and ii ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop we believe that the current carrying value for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

disposition activity 

we i sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2013 to january 31 2014 we sold our interest in eight whollyowned communities four of which were acquired by the company as part of the archstone acquisition containing 3299 apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 932800000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a risk factors of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 150000000 of coverage an increase over the 75000000 of coverage under our prior insurance policy earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a 175000000 limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate in california the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 350000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional selfinsured retention until the total incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1500000 

in may 2013 we renewed our property insurance policy with no material change in coverage terms other than the increase in our earthquake coverage discussed above in august 2013 we renewed our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies with no material change in coverage 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra which is designed to 

make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program until it expires in december 2014 congress is currently considering extending the act however there can be no assurance at this time that congress will extend the provisions of the act in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 250000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as noncertified terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the companys related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a risk factors—we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 5000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property 







 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is involved in various claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given the company does not currently believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations

 item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

our common stock is traded on the nyse under the ticker symbol avb the following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices per share of our common stock for the years 2013 and 2012 as reported by the nyse on january 31 2014 there were 563 holders of record of an aggregate of 129417333 shares of our outstanding common stock the number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one record holder 



at present we expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends however the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time

executive overview 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

our strategy is to be leaders in market research and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming submarkets of the united states our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are primarily located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states 

financial highlights 

for the year ended december 31 2013 net income attributable to common stockholders was 353141000 compared to 423869000 for 2012 a decrease of 167 the decrease is attributable primarily to an increase in depreciation expense and expensed transaction costs associated with the archstone acquisition coupled with the recognition of a loss associated with an interest rate protection agreement the decrease was partially offset by an increase in noi from our communities 

for the year ended december 31 2013 established communities noi increased by 26147000 or 47 over the prior year the increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 43 partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 35 over 2012 

on february 27 2013 pursuant to the purchase agreement dated november 26 2012 by and among us equity residential lehman and archstone we together with equity residential acquired directly or indirectly all of archstones assets including all of the ownership interests in joint ventures and other entities owned by archstone and assumed archstones liabilities with certain limited exceptions under the terms of the purchase agreement we acquired approximately 40 of archstones assets and liabilities and equity residential acquired approximately 60 of archstones assets and liabilities we acquired the following 

• 54 operating apartment communities that were consolidated for financial reporting purposes containing 18423 apartment homes of which four communities containing 1368 apartment homes were subsequently disposed of during 2013 • six communities that were under construction andor in leaseup of which two have been completed with 553 homes and the other four of which are expected to be completed during 2014 and contain 1114 apartment homes • six parcels of land one of which we sold to the ac jv which is currently being developed • options to acquire two additional parcels of land of which one was acquired in 2013 and will begin construction in 2014 • interests in unconsolidated joint ventures in which we are the general partner or managing member which joint ventures own 11 apartment communities containing 2544 apartment homes and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture in which we are a limited partner which joint venture owns one apartment community containing 305 apartment homes and • a 40 ownership interest in unconsolidated joint venture arrangements with equity residential which will hold assets and liabilities that we and equity residential will jointly manage and that we and equity residential intend to sell to or resolve with third parties andor subsequently transfer to equity residential or to us in 2013 our capital activity related to funding the archstone acquisition as well as our core business activities in our development and redevelopment platforms our funding for the archstone acquisition included the assumption of approximately 2 billion in net indebtedness as well as the issuance to lehman of 14889706 shares of our common stock in addition to this activity during 2013 we raised approximately 1682800000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes and asset sales the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of eight communities for gross sales proceeds of 932800000 in addition in february 2014 we sold one community avalon valley located in danbury ct for 53325000 we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value we increased development activity during 2013 from the prior year in anticipation of favorable economic conditions and apartment fundamentals during 2013 we completed the development of 12 communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 630000000 we also started the development of 13 communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 1323000000 in addition during 2013 we completed the redevelopment of six communities for a total investment of 52700000 excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

we believe that our balance sheet strength as measured by our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets we expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs as they arise through a combination of one or more of the following sources operating cash flows borrowings under our credit facility secured debt the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured 

debt preferred equity andor common equity the sale of apartment communities or through the formation of joint ventures see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

in addition to the archstone acquisition during the year ended december 31 2013 we acquired arboretum at burlington located in burlington ma arboretum at burlington contains 312 apartment homes and was acquired for a purchase price of 79850000 

we established fund i and fund ii collectively the funds to engage in real estate acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds and iii additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund i has nine institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund i we have an equity investment of approximately 14209000 in fund i net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a fund i community representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i has a term that expires in march 2015

communities overview 

as of december 31 2013 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 273 apartment communities containing 81519 apartment homes in 12 states and the district of columbia of which 29 communities were under construction and three communities were under reconstruction of these communities 36 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including four owned by subsidiaries of fund i 12 owned by subsidiaries of fund ii and nine owned by the us fund in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 46 whollyowned communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 12986 apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities development communities and development rights our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities 

established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities to be compared between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 segment reporting of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found in liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of 

noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2013 2012 and 2011 follows dollars in thousands 



  net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 70728000 or 167 to 353141000 in 2013 due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense and expensed transaction costs associated with the archstone acquisition coupled with the recognition of a loss associated with an interest rate protection agreement the decrease was partially offset by an increase in noi from communities acquired in the archstone acquisition and our existing and newly developed communities in 2013 as well as an increase in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 17753000 or 40 in 2012 over 2011 due primarily to a decrease in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year offset partially by increased noi in 2012 over 2011 

  noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



the noi increases for both 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior year period consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



the increase in our established communities noi in 2013 is due to increased rental rates and increased occupancy partially offset by increased operating expenses during 2013 we experienced increases in rental rates over 2012 while maintaining occupancy of at least 95 in all markets offset partially by an increase in operating expenses 

  rental and other income increased in both 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities including those acquired in the archstone acquisition in 2013 and increases in rental rates and occupancy at our established communities 

overall portfolio—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 57240 apartment homes for 2013 which includes the impact of communities acquired in the archstone acquisition as compared to 43411 homes for 2012 and 42613 homes for 2011 the increase in 2013 over 2012 is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities which includes the impact of communities acquired in the archstone acquisition offset partially by communities sold during 2013 and 2012 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2171 for 2013 as compared to 2017 in 2012 and 1911 in 2011 

established communities—rental revenue increased 34749000 or 43 for 2013 and increased 41698000 or 58 for 2012 as compared to the respective prior years for 2013 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 42 to 2156 compared to 2069 in 2012 the increase for 2013 is due to an increase in rental rates of 42 and economic occupancy of 01 to 962 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in 2013 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region which accounted for approximately 299 of the established community rental revenue for 2013 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 43 for 2013 as compared to 2012 average rental rates increased 43 during 2013 to 2563 and economic occupancy remained consistent at 965 apartment demand in the metro new yorknew jersey region is being driven by job growth across a diverse group of industries including healthcare professional business services technology retail hospitality and education the region also experienced an increase in construction related employment growth related to hurricane sandy recovery efforts we expect to see continued but moderating growth in the metro new yorknew jersey region in 2014 new york city is beginning to see a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries in 2014 but suburban markets surrounding the city are mostly insulated from this new competition 

the new england region accounted for approximately 213 of the established community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 32 over the prior year average rental rates increased 31 to 2137 and economic occupancy increased 01 to 958 for 2013 as compared to 2012 the new england regions favorable results are driven by employment growth in the medical education and technology fields in the boston metro area in response to a favorable employment market the region benefitted from an inmigration the boston metro area is seeing a recovery in forsale housing ahead of most other regions resulting in resurgence in suburban employment the fairfield market continues to experience slower growth due to this markets greater exposure to the financial services sector which has experienced slower job growth during this recovery than other industries while demand drivers should become more favorable in 2014 we expect this market to continue to lag due to new supply pressure particularly in and around stamford 

the northern california region accounted for approximately 169 of the established community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 81 over the prior year average rental rates increased 78 to 2335 and economic occupancy increased 03 to 963 for 2013 as compared to 2012 while new apartment supply may slow revenue growth in future periods we expect the strength in the technology and medical sectors to continue to fuel demand for apartment homes in 2014 

the southern california region accounted for approximately 143 of the established community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 39 over the prior year average rental rates increased 37 to 1767 and economic occupancy increased 02 to 963 for 2013 as compared to 2012 southern california has seen steady job growth and limited new apartment supply which we expect will continue to support favorable operating results in 2014 

the midatlantic region which represented approximately 120 of the established community rental revenue during 2013 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 08 as compared to 2012 average rental rates increased by 09 to 1967 and were partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 01 to 959 for 2013 as compared to 2012 the region experienced a modest decrease in revenue growth in the second half of 2013 driven by an increase in the supply of apartment homes combined with the impact of the decline in federal government spending we expect rental revenue to decline further in the midatlantic region during 2014 as additional supply is delivered into the market 

the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 56 of the established community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 72 over the prior year average rental rates increased 75 to 1695 and were partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 03 to 957 for 2013 as compared to 2012 the regions innovative technology ecommerce and manufacturing sectors continue to support growth in the economy and improvement in apartment fundamentals rental revenue growth may be tempered in the near term due to the increased supply of apartment homes in 2014 particularly in the urban core of seattle which may affect our future revenue growth in this region 

  management development and other fees increased 1245000 or 121 in 2013 and increased 601000 or 62 in 2012 as compared to the prior years the increase in 2013 was primarily due to management fees related to the us fund and the ac jv partially offset by lower property management and other management fees earned related to dispositions from fund i and fund ii the increase in 2012 was primarily due to increased asset management fees and property management fees from fund ii over the prior year 

  direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 84064000 or 398 and 9553000 or 47 in 2013 and 2012 respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2013 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment homes including the communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition the increase in 2012 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed apartment homes 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 4374000 or 26 in 2013 and decreased 475000 or 03 in 2012 as compared to the prior years the increase in 2013 was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance insurance and office operations costs 

  property taxes increased 61219000 or 628 and 8591000 or 97 in 2013 and 2012 respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2013 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment homes including communities acquired as part of the archstone acquisition coupled with increased tax rates and assessments across our portfolio the increase in 2012 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 

for established communities property taxes increased 4282000 or 54 and 4581000 or 65 in 2013 and 2012 respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2013 was due to higher rates and assessments partially offset by higher successful appeals and refunds received in 2013 

as compared to the prior year for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases the increase in 2012 was primarily due to appeals and settlements recognized in 2011 that were not present in 2012 coupled with increased rates and assessments throughout our regions we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

  corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased 10912000 or 259 in 2013 and increased 1980000 or 49 in 2012 as compared to the prior years the increases in both years were primarily due to increased compensation related costs with the increase in 2013 over 2012 including the increase in overhead associated with the archstone acquisition the increase in 2012 was also attributable to costs associated with our introduction and implementation of our ava and eaves by avalon brands 

  investments and investment management costs decreased 2081000 or 343 in 2013 and increased by 945000 or 184 in 2012 due to reductions in compensation costs as our investment fund management activity has declined 

  expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred related to our asset investment activity abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period these costs increased 33700000 or 2969 and 8383000 or 2825 in 2013 and 2012 respectively as compared to the prior years primarily due to costs associated with the archstone acquisition 

  interest expense net increased 35482000 or 259 in 2013 and decreased 30894000 or 184 in 2012 as compared to the prior years this category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development activity amortization of the mark to market adjustment on debt assumed as part of the archstone acquisition and interest income the increase in 2013 was primarily due to net interest costs on debt assumed in the archstone acquisition partially offset by increased capitalized interest as compared to the prior year the decrease in 2012 was primarily due to decreased average outstanding indebtedness and lower average effective interest rates coupled with increased capitalized interest this decrease was partially offset by interest income associated with escrow accounts for certain tax exempt secured borrowings recognized in 2011 that were not present in 2012 the increase in capitalized interest in both 2013 and 2012 over the respective prior years was driven primarily by increased development activity and development pursuits 

  loss on interest rate contract reflects the loss recorded by the company related to the forward interest rate protection agreement that matured in may 2013 based on changes in the companys capital needs in 2013 the company did not issue the anticipated debt for which the interest rate protection agreement was transacted 

  loss on the extinguishment of debt net reflects prepayment penalties the expensing of deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired excluding costs related to debt secured by assets sold or held for sale which is included in discontinued operations below during 2013 we incurred a charge for prepayment penalties and the writeoff of deferred fees related to the early retirement of three secured notes during 2012 we recognized a noncash charge for the writeoff of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note 

  depreciation expense increased 316535000 or 1299 and 16952 or 75 in 2013 and 2012 respectively as compared to the prior years the increase in 2013 was primarily due to additional depreciation expense from the archstone acquisition consisting largely of the depreciation of inplace lease intangibles which were depreciated over a six month period the increase in 2012 was primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development redevelopment and acquisition activity partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during the year 

  general and administrative expense ga increased 5472000 or 160 and 4730000 or 161 in 2013 and 2012 respectively as compared to the prior years the increases in both years were primarily due to increased compensation costs including costs related to the archstone acquisition in 2013 the increase in 2012 was also due to increased professional fees 

  casualty and impairment loss for 2012 consists of the losses we incurred associated with superstorm sandy amounts for 2011 consist of the write down of two land parcels and an other than temporary impairment of an investment in unconsolidated joint venture 

  gain on sale of land decreased in 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior years due to decreased volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels 

  gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity represents the amount by which the fair value of our prior ownership interest in the joint venture that owned avalon del rey exceeded our carrying value 

  equity in loss income of unconsolidated entities decreased 32068000 or 1533 in 2013 and increased 15794000 or 3085 in 2012 as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2013 is primarily due to costs of approximately 39543000 associated with the archstone acquisition that were incurred through the unconsolidated joint venture entities owned with equity residential during the year the increase in 2012 was primarily due to the recognition of income from our promoted interest for avalon del rey and an increase in our proportionate share of gains from fund i disposition activity over the prior year 

  income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by real estate sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2011 through december 31 2013 income from discontinued operations decreased in 2013 and increased in 2012 due to changes in the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area as compared to the prior year see note 7 real estate disposition activities to our consolidated financial statements 

  gain on sale of communities increased in 2013 and decreased in 2012 due to changes in the volume of community disposition activity and associated gains as compared to the prior year the amount of gain realized upon disposition of communities depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 

  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in an allocation of loss of 370000 in 2013 307000 in 2012 and 252000 in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

• development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged • the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the code • debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity and 56 

• normal recurring operating expenses factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

in 2014 we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources which may include real estate dispositions cash balances on hand borrowing capacity under our credit facility secured and unsecured debt financings and other public or private sources of liquidity including the issuance of common and preferred equity as well as cash generated from our operating activities our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects capital raising activities in 2013 included asset sales the issuance of unsecured notes in september and december and the issuance of common shares to lehman and assumption of secured debt as part of the archstone acquisition 

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 281541000 at december 31 2013 a decrease of 2452077000 from 2733618000 at december 31 2012 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 724501000 in 2013 from 540819000 in 2012 the increase was primarily driven by increased noi from community operations in 2013 as compared to 2012 and the timing of payments of corporate expenditures 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities of 1181174000 in 2013 primarily related to investments in assets through acquisition development and redevelopment in 2013 we invested 2151799000 in the following areas 

• we invested 839469000 in the acquisition of real estate related to acquisitions primarily the archstone acquisition • we invested 1285715000 in the development and redevelopment of communities and • we had capital expenditures of 26615000 for real estate and nonreal estate assets financing activities—net cash used in financing activities totaled 1995404000 in 2013 the net cash used is due to the repayment of 2110347000 in secured notes and prepayment penalties primarily in conjunction with the archstone acquisition payment of cash dividends in the amount of 526050000 and the repayment of 100000000 in unsecured notes partially offset by the issuance of 750000000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes

the company has a 1300000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility which matures in april 2017 we may extend the maturity for up to one year through the exercise of two six month extension options for an aggregate fee of 1950000 the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate 

libor rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 105 121 at january 31 2014 assuming a one month borrowing rate the annual facility fee is 015 or approximately 1950000 annually based on the 1300000000 facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 66396000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2014 

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the financial covenants include the following 

• limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure • limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by propertyspecific financing and • minimum levels of debt service coverage we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2013 

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in august 2012 we commenced a third continuous equity program cep iii under which we are authorized by our board of directors to sell up to 750000000 of shares of our common stock from time to time during a 36month period in conjunction with cep iii we have engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold during the year ended december 31 2013 we had no sales under cep iii and have 646274000 of shares that remain authorized for issuance under this program 

issuance of common stock in archstone acquisition 

during 2013 we issued 14889706 shares of common stock to lehman as defined in note 5 archstone acquisition of our consolidated financial statements in conjunction with the archstone acquisition on february 18 2014 lehman announced that it had sold all of the shares of our common stock it received as consideration for the archstone acquisition lehman received all of the net proceeds from the sale of its shares of our common stock and lehmans sale of such shares did not impact the total number of the our shares of common stock outstanding 

future financing and capital needs—debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for both our unsecured and secured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance or repay the debt this refinancing or repayment may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings equity issuances additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our credit facility although we believe we will have the capacity to 

meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory

• in connection with the archstone acquisition we assumed 2034482000 net principal amount of archstones existing secured indebtedness detailed in the following table • in march 2013 we repaid 100000000 principal amount of 495 unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity • in april 2013 we obtained a 306 fixed rate secured mortgage loan in the amount of 15000000 that matures in april 2018 • in april 2013 we repaid a 469 fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of 170125000 pursuant to its scheduled maturity date • in may 2013 we repaid a 5393000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 555 at par and without penalty in advance of its july 2028 scheduled maturity date • in may 2013 we obtained a 308 fixed rate secured mortgage loan that matures in june 2020 in the amount of 56210000 in association with the refinancing of an existing 47000000 variable rate secured mortgage note the refinancing was necessitated by the secured communityspecific tax protection obligation assumed through certain of the preferred interests we assumed as part of the archstone acquisition • in may 2013 we repaid a 52806000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 524 pursuant to its scheduled maturity date • in september 2013 we issued 400000000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately 396212000 the notes mature in october 2020 and were issued at a 363 interest rate the notes have an effective interest rate of 379 including the effect of offering costs • in december 2013 we issued 350000000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately 346934000 the notes mature in december 2023 and were issued at a 420 interest rate the notes have an effective interest rate of 430 including the effect of offering costs • in december 2013 we repaid a 150000000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 566 a 110600000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 548 and a 41439000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 475 in advance of their 2015 maturity dates and incurred a charge for repayment penalties and the writeoff of deferred fees of 14921000 the following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2013 dollars in thousands as compared to the amounts of debt outstanding as of at december 31 2012 we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have any equity or other interest

future financing and capital needs—portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2013 we had 29 whollyowned communities under construction and three whollyowned communities under reconstruction substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

• our 1300000000 credit facility • cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements and shortterm investment vehicles • retained operating cash • the net proceeds from sales of existing communities • the issuance of debt or equity securities andor • private equity funding including joint venture activity 61 

before planned construction or reconstruction activity including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures begins or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

• we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals • we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable increases in costs of development increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability resulting in losses • construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates • we may not complete construction and leaseup of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues • occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control • financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities 68 

• our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness • we may be unsuccessful in our management of fund i fund ii the us fund the ac jv or the reit vehicles that are used with each of them and • we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 organization and basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method excluding joint venture entities the company formed with equity residential as part of the archstone acquisition at december 31 2013 our assets would have increased by 1925274000 and our liabilities would have increased by 1280744000 we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

• for entities not considered to be variable interest entities the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary • for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting andor variable interest the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting andor variable interest we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any project specific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 38128000 26513000 and 23984000 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2013 our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our costs charged to expense would have increased by 3813000 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2013 would have decreased by 3159000 

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist such assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the 

carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property based on periodic tests of recoverability of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we did not recognize any impairment losses for whollyowned operating real estate assets 

we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits in the amounts of 998000 in 2013 1757000 in 2012 and 1957000 in 2011 these costs are included in operating expenses excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

we also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we did not recognize any impairment charges for land holdings in 2013 or 2012 during 2011 we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels where the carrying values of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable as a result we recognized an aggregate charge of 12097000 for the impairment of these land parcels we had previously recognized an impairment loss of 9952000 in 2008 when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis of the land parcels existed we looked to a combination of internal models and thirdparty pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using thirdparty estimates of fair value for the internally generated fair values we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community the cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying asset as well as potential disposition proceeds the thirdparty values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy 

we also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments during 2011 we concluded that because the market for forsale housing development had not improved as expected the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary as a result we recognized a charge of 1955000 for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture there were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during 2013 or 2012 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code for the year ended 

december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2013 our net income would have decreased by approximately 141963000 

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 

acquisition of investments in real estate 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement which requires the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value typical assets and liabilities acquired include land building furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovebelow market leases and inplace leases in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data

additional disclosure relating to taxation of avalonbay as a reit 

the section captioned  taxation of avalonbay as a reit—ownership of partnership interests by a reit  is replaced in its entirety by the following 

ownership of partnership interests by a reit a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member in a limited liability company or other entity that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and will be deemed to earn its proportionate share of the partnerships income the assets and gross income of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the reit for purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to reits as described below thus our proportionate share of the assets and items of gross income of any entity taxable as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes in which we hold an interest will be treated as our assets and liabilities and our items of income for purposes of applying the requirements described in this prospectus the assets liabilities and items of income of any partnership in which we own an interest include such entitys share of the assets and liabilities and items of income with respect to any partnership in which it holds an interest 

the assets of one of our joint ventures with equity residential include indirect interests in partnerships controlled by equity residential and thus for purposes of our compliance with the reit asset and gross income requirements we will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the assets and as receiving our proportionate share of gross income of the equity residential partnerships in which the joint venture has an interest although equity residential has agreed to operate those 

partnerships in compliance with the reit requirements we cannot assure you that such equity residential partnerships will be operated in compliance with the reit requirements failure by those partnerships to comply with the reit requirements could potentially jeopardize our reit status 

the discussion above does not apply to our interest in any partnership or other unincorporated entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes if an entity that we treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and the reit requirements were determined instead to be taxed as a corporation we could fail one or more of the reit income and asset tests described below generally a domestic unincorporated entity with two or more owners is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes unless it affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation however certain publicly traded partnerships are treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes a publicly traded partnership is any partnership i the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or ii the interests in which are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof however under the relevant treasury regulations interests in a partnership will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market or on the substantial equivalent of a secondary market if the partnership qualifies for specified safe harbors which are based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to the partnership moreover certain publicly traded partnerships will avoid being treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes if the partnership derives at least 90 of its gross income from certain specified sources of qualifying income we do not believe that any of our direct or indirect subsidiary partnerships should be treated as corporations under the publicly traded partnership rules however a contrary determination could prevent us from qualifying as a reit 

the fifth paragraph in the section captioned  taxation of avalonbay as a reit—income tests applicable to reits  is replaced with the following 

taxable dividends from a taxable reit subsidiary and gain from a sale or other taxable disposition of interests in a taxable reit subsidiary will qualify under the 95 income test but not the 75 income test our need to satisfy the 75 income test may adversely affect our ability to distribute earnings from or dispose of our investment in a taxable reit subsidiary 

the following paragraph is added at the end of the section captioned  taxation of avalonbay as a reit—asset tests applicable to reits  

shares in other qualifying reits are treated as real estate assets for purposes of the reit assets tests while shares of our taxable reit subsidiaries do not qualify as real estate assets 

the last sentence in the section captioned  other us federal income tax withholding and reporting requirements  is replaced with the following 

the most recent guidance from the irs delays withholding under fatca on withholdable payments to foreign financial institutions and nonfinancial foreign entities until after december 31 2016 with respect to gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce us source interest or dividends and certain other sources of income and after june 30 2014 with respect to other withholdable payments 

the section captioned  expiration of certain reduced tax provisions  is replaced with the following 

federal income tax rates update 

as of january 1 2013 1 the maximum tax rate on qualified dividend income for noncorporate taxpayers is 20 2 the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gain for noncorporate taxpayers is 20 3 the highest marginal noncorporate income tax rate is 396 and 4 the backup withholding rate remains at 28 thus references in the prospectus to 15 rate gain distributions shall be replaced with references to 20 rate gain distributions which are taxed to noncorporate us shareholders at the new maximum 20 longterm capital gains rate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had 1011609000 and 476935000 respectively in variable rate debt outstanding with no amounts outstanding under our credit facility if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2013 and 2012 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 9680000 and 3969000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years in conjunction with the archstone acquisition we assumed approximately 2034482000 secured fixed and floating rate indebtedness which impacted the companys overall exposure to interest rate risk in may 2013 a 215000000 forward interest rate protection agreement matured resulting in a payment to the counterparty of 51000000 the fair value at time of settlement 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable including amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 6029998000 at december 31 2013 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 6294850000 at december 31 2013 contractual fixed rate debt represented 5255089000 of the fair value at december 31 2013 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2013 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 321709000

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the company which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states these barriers to entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are currently located in the following regions of the united states new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and northern and southern california we focus on these markets because we believe that over the longterm a limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in higher growth in cash flows relative to other markets 

at january 31 2013 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

• 178 operating apartment communities containing 52427 apartment homes in nine states and the district of columbia of which 155 communities containing 45056 apartment homes were consolidated for financial reporting purposes two communities containing 674 apartment homes were held by joint ventures in which we hold an ownership interest and 21 communities containing 6697 apartment homes were owned by the funds as defined below five of the consolidated communities containing 1787 apartment homes were under redevelopment as discussed below • 23 whollyowned communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of 6599 apartment homes when completed and • rights to develop an additional 34 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 9602 apartment homes the company has entered into a material agreement to purchase direct and indirect interests in real estate assets that will significantly change our property holdings and capital structure see business—archstone acquisition the closing of the acquisition is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2013 after the filing of this form 10k 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear 

comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 8 segment reporting of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartments in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire an interest in apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital our strategy is to be leaders in multifamily market research consumer insight and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming us submarkets a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we operate our apartment communities under three core brands avalon ava and eaves by avalon we believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint the avalon brand is our core offering focusing on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services in urban and suburban markets our ava brand is designed for people who want to live in or near urban neighborhoods and in close proximity to public transportation services shopping and nightlife ava apartments are generally smaller many engineered for roommate living and feature modern design and a technology focus our eaves by avalon brand is designed for renters who seek good quality apartment living often in a suburban setting with practical amenities and services at a more modest price point 

during the three years ended december 31 2012 excluding activity for the funds as defined below we acquired four apartment communities in addition during this period we purchased our joint venture partners interest in one operating community obtaining a 100 ownership interest in that apartment community during the same threeyear period excluding dispositions in which we retained an ownership interest we disposed of 10 apartment communities and completed the development of 18 apartment communities and the redevelopment of 23 apartment communities in addition in 2011 we exchanged a portfolio of three communities and a parcel of land we owned for a portfolio of six communities and 26000000 in cash 

during this period we also realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of eight communities owned by avalonbay value added fund lp fund i an institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 152 interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i acquired 20 communities in addition fund i sold one community in 2013 through the date this form 10k was filed 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp fund ii a second institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 313 interest in 2012 fund ii acquired its final operating community which was an active acquisition candidate as of august 2011 the end of the investment period for fund ii from the commencement of fund ii through the close of the investment period fund ii acquired 13 operating communities fund ii sold one community in 2013 through the date this form 10k was filed a more detailed description of fund i and fund ii collectively the funds and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 6 investments in real estate entities of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report and in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

including sales by unconsolidated entities and entities in which we held a residual profits interest during 2012 we sold 12 real estate assets consisting of 11 operating communities and one land parcel and recognized a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap of 156420000 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

• boston massachusetts • long island new york • los angeles california • new york new york • newport beach california • san francisco california • san jose california • seattle washington • shelton connecticut • virginia beach virginia and • woodbridge new jersey after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 communities in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any rent received from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term development is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to construction refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have a dedicated group of associates and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phases 

throughout this report the term redevelopment is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as reconstruction which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us 

achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community net operating income noi we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new third fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and disposition although we may acquire investments in existing fund structures in connection with the archstone acquisition any fund acquired is not expected to limit our ability to acquire investments for our own account 

property management strategy we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

• strong focus on resident satisfaction • staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are better matched to traffic patterns • balancing high occupancy with premium pricing and increasing rents as market conditions permit and • employing revenue management software to optimize the pricing and term of leases constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

• we use purchase order controls acquiring goods and services from preapproved vendors • we use national negotiated contracts and also purchase supplies in bulk where possible • we bid thirdparty contracts on a volume basis • we strive to retain residents through high levels of service in order to eliminate the cost of preparing an apartment home for a new resident and to reduce marketing and vacant apartment utility costs • we perform turnover work inhouse or hire third parties generally depending upon the least costly alternative • we undertake preventive maintenance regularly to maximize resident satisfaction and property and equipment life and • we aggressively pursue real estate tax appeals onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income noi produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a 

taxable reit subsidiary which is a subsidiary that is treated as a c corporation subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1300000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the credit facility sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 458693 square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under construction gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2012 was 8806000 08 of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail component of a mixeduse building that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to 

qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 or the treasury regulations our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

archstone acquisition 

in november 2012 we entered into agreements with i equity residential and its operating partnership erp operating partnership lp equity residential ii lehman brothers holdings inc lehman and iii archstone enterprise lp archstone pursuant to which avalonbay and equity residential will acquire directly or indirectly all of the assets liabilities and ownership interests in joint ventures or other entities owned by archstone under the terms of the agreements we will acquire approximately 40 of archstones assets and liabilities and equity residential will acquire approximately 60 of archstones assets and liabilities archstone acquisition the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2013 

as disclosed in november 2012 we expect to purchase the following as part of the archstone acquisition which is subject to adjustment up until the transaction closes 

• 66 apartment communities that are expected to be consolidated for financial reporting purposes containing 22222 apartment homes of which six communities are under construction and are expected to contain 1666 apartment homes upon completion • three parcels of land which are expected to be wholly owned and if developed as anticipated are expected to contain a total of 968 apartment homes • interests in joint ventures the assets of which consist primarily of real estate for which our ownership percentage is expected to be up to 40 and that are not expected to be consolidated for financial reporting purposes the company expects to provide the following consideration for the archstone acquisition 

• the issuance of 14889706 shares of its common stock to lehman or its designees • cash payment of 669000000 to lehman or its designees • the assumption of approximately 3700000000 principal amount of consolidated indebtedness • the acquisition with equity residential of interests in entities that have preferred units outstanding that may be presented for redemption from time to time the companys 40 share of the liquidation value of and accrued dividends on these outstanding archstone preferred units as of january 31 2013 was 132200000 and • the assumption with equity residential of all other liabilities known or unknown of archstone other than certain excluded liabilities the company will share in 40 of the cost of these liabilities equity residential and we are jointly and severally liable for most obligations to lehman related to the archstone acquisition if we and equity residential fail to close archstone acquisition by march 26 2013 then equity residential and we could be liable for payment of a termination fee of 800000000 the closing of the transaction is also subject to customary closing conditions which do not include our and equity residentials ability to obtain the necessary financing or lender consents for the transaction unless otherwise stated all amounts and disclosures included in this form 10k do not include any impact from the anticipated closing of the archstone acquisition 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a risk factors 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

we may fail to consummate the archstone acquisition or may not consummate it on the terms described in this report 

we expect to consummate the archstone acquisition during the first quarter of 2013 assuming that all of the conditions in the related asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement are satisfied or waived the consummation of the archstone acquisition however is subject to certain closing conditions including conditions that must be met by equity residential and which are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied on the anticipated schedule or at all in addition under certain circumstances we or lehman may terminate the purchase agreement as a result there can be no assurance that the archstone acquisition will be consummated in its entirety in accordance with the anticipated timing or at all 

in addition if the archstone acquisition does not occur we will not recover our costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction and we may be liable for all or a portion of the 800000000 termination fee if payable 

we andor equity residential may fail to perform under the purchase agreement or may not perform on the terms prescribed 

we dont believe that we could meet or that equity residential could meet the obligations as buyer set forth in the purchase agreement without the timely performance of the other thus we and equity residential are each dependent upon the performance of the other to meet the buyers obligations under the purchase agreement a default by either party under the purchase agreement could give rise to adverse consequences to the breaching party pursuant to certain arrangements between us and equity residential under our arrangements with equity residential if the termination of the purchase agreement is solely a result of a breach by either us or equity residential then the breaching party shall be solely responsible for and shall indemnify the nonbreaching party against the fees and expenses including the termination fee of up to 800000000 payable to lehman resulting from a failure to consummate the acquisition and any outofpocket expenses incurred by such nonbreaching party in connection with enforcing its rights against the breaching party 

our business and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if the archstone acquisition is not completed 

the archstone acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions if the archstone acquisition is not completed we could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock including 

• the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the archstone acquisition will be completed • we must pay certain costs related to the archstone acquisition such as legal and accounting fees and expenses regardless of whether the archstone acquisition is consummated • we would not realize the benefits we expect to realize from consummating the archstone acquisition and • we together with equity residential may be liable for a termination fee of up to 800000000 10 

we will incur substantial expenses and payments even if the archstone acquisition is not completed 

we have incurred substantial legal accounting financial advisory and other costs and our management has devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the archstone acquisition if the archstone acquisition is not completed we will bear certain fees and expenses associated with the archstone acquisition without realizing the benefits of the archstone acquisition the fees and expenses may be significant and could have an adverse impact on our operating results for instance if lehman terminates the purchase agreement due to a breach by us or a failure by us to satisfy a condition precedent to lehmans obligation to close the archstone acquisition we would be obligated to pay to lehman a termination fee of up to 800000000 

we intend to assume indebtedness in connection with the archstone acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  

we intend to assume 3700000000 principal amount of consolidated indebtedness in connection with the archstone acquisition which will increase our leverage and the ratio of our net debt to our earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization 

we expect to repay contemporaneously with the closing up to 1700000000 principal amount of assumed indebtedness from the archstone acquisition however there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce or refinance over time to the extent we anticipate the indebtedness we are assuming therefore the increase in indebtedness we will incur at closing of the archstone acquisition could have adverse consequences on our business such as 

• requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness which would reduce the available cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures development projects and other general corporate purposes such as dividends • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital needs acquisitions capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes • limiting our ability to compete with other companies that are not as highly leveraged as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions • restricting us from making other strategic acquisitions developing additional properties or exploiting other business opportunities • restricting the way in which we conduct our business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and our subsidiaries existing and future indebtedness • exposing us to potential events of default if not cured or waived under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries debt instruments that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results • increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions and • limiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in our industry in addition to our debt service obligations our operations may require substantial investments on a continuing basis our ability to make scheduled debt payments to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and noncapital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business depends on our financial and operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business competitive legal and other factors 

the intended benefits of the archstone acquisition may not be realized which could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock after the archstone acquisition 

the archstone acquisition poses risks for our ongoing operations including that 

• our senior managements attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of the archstone acquisition including management of assets located outside of our core markets pending disposition which may disrupt management of our existing business and our relationships with our customers • we may bear costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities • the archstone acquisition may not perform as well as we anticipate and • unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating the archstone acquisition into our portfolio also we expect to acquire assets and assume liabilities in connection with the archstone acquisition on an as is basis with only limited representations from lehman surviving after the closing of the archstone acquisition which limits our recourse against the seller for breaches of representations after closing which in turn may expose us to unexpected material losses or expenses after the closing 

in addition our diligence investigations with respect to the assets comprising the archstone acquisition has been more limited than would be the case if we were acquiring individual apartment communities or land parcels which may also expose us to unexpected material losses or expenses after the closing 

as a result of the foregoing we cannot assure you that the archstone acquisition will be accretive to us in the near term or at all furthermore if we fail to realize the intended benefits of the archstone acquisition the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the market price reflects those anticipated benefits 

the archstone acquisition will significantly increase the size of our real estate portfolio and related personnel and operating and financial needs and we may not be successful in integrating the archstone acquisition into our business 

the archstone acquisition involves a variety of risks including potential difficulties in integrating the portfolio diversions of our management resources differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness at the acquired entities and other unanticipated problems and liabilities any of these risks could adversely affect our financial results and reduce or delay our ability to obtain the expected benefits of the archstone acquisition 

in addition the increased need for financial resources that will result from the archstone acquisition as well as the diversion of our management resources may affect our existing development redevelopment and acquisition portfolios and development rights pipeline as a result there may be unexpected delays in the timing of our activities relating to our existing real estate portfolios and development rights pipeline and we may encounter unexpected costs or we may not succeed in obtaining the expected benefits of our currently expected real estate development redevelopment and acquisition activities these issues could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

the governance provisions of our joint ventures with equity residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities  

in connection with the archstone acquisition we expect to create joint ventures with equity residential to manage certain of the acquired assets and liabilities these structures involve 

participation in the investment by equity residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate including the risk that equity residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures under the expected form for the joint venture arrangements neither we nor equity residential expect to have the power to control the ventures and an impasse could occur which would adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors 

we expect to assume substantially all liabilities related to the archstone acquisition and may be responsible for liabilities that were not known when we entered into the purchase agreement 

under the purchase agreement we and equity residential will assume substantially all liabilities related to the archstone portfolio whether or not they were known by us and equity residential at the time we entered into the purchase agreement and we have agreed to indemnify lehman with respect to these liabilities under the purchase agreement we would be solely liable for these obligations if equity residential were to default on its obligation to share these indemnification obligations with us as a result we could become liable for liabilities that are not currently known to us and the amount of these liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we intend to dispose of certain assets acquired in connection with the archstone acquisition but we may be unable to achieve the expected proceeds of these acquisitions or may be unable to dispose of these assets at all 

we intend to dispose of certain assets acquired in connection with the archstone acquisition including assets held in our joint ventures with equity residential but we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any of the properties on favorable terms and conditions if at all or the length of time over which we expect to sell any of the assets we may be unable to sell some of the properties which may adversely affect our liquidity or we may have to sell properties at depressed prices which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our joint ventures with equity residential will own among other assets investments in apartment communities in germany and we will acquire from archstone interests in us markets that we are not currently in including florida georgia and texas our efforts to manage position andor dispose of these investments may distract management and we may not achieve the intended results 

future sales or issuances of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

in connection with the archstone acquisition we will issue shares of our common stock under the purchase agreement and we will be required to register the resale of such shares of common stock under the securities act the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock whether directly by us or in the secondary market the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equityrelated securities 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities 

including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

• we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs and as a result we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities • occupancy rates and rents at a community may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing communities • we may be unable to obtain or experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities • we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material labor or other costs • we may be unable to complete construction and leaseup of a community on schedule resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues • we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms or at all for the proposed development of a community which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity • we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process for example in connection with managing existing improvements on the site prior to tenant terminations and demolition such as commercial space or in connection with providing services to third parties such as the construction of shared infrastructure or other improvements and • we may incur liability if our communities are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities acts the fair housing act or other federal state or local requirements noncompliance could result in imposition of fines an award of damages to private litigants and a requirement that we undertake structural modifications to remedy the noncompliance we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

• land andor property acquisition costs • fees paid to secure air rights andor tax abatements • construction or reconstruction costs • costs of environmental remediation • real estate taxes • capitalized interest and insurance • loan fees • permits • professional fees 14 

• allocated development or redevelopment overhead and • other regulatory fees costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

• plant closings industry slowdowns and other factors that adversely affect the local economy • an oversupply of or a reduced demand for apartment homes • a decline in household formation or employment or lack of employment growth • the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases • rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing that could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs and • economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses such as increases in property taxes utilities compensation of onsite associates and routine maintenance changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as taxexempt bonds and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2012 approximately 647 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank jpmorgan chase bank na as a bank and as syndication agent deutsche bank trust company americas morgan stanley bank and wells fargo bank na each as a bank and as documentation agent barclays bank plc as a bank and as codocumentation agent ubs ag stamford branch as a codocumentation agent goldman sachs bank usa the bank of new york mellon compass bank pnc bank national association and suntrust bank each as a bank and as a managing agent branch banking and trust company bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj ltd and capital one na each as a bank and as a coagent and the other bank parties signatory thereto our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties that are subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac 

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of secured financing to the multifamily industry and we have used fannie mae and freddie mac for a portion of our financing needs in february 2011 the obama administration released a report calling for the winding down of the role that fannie mae and freddie mac play in the mortgage market a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of multifamily community loans may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the value of multifamily communities 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with 

respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit liquidity and financial flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

• an acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment and • our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily business we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are currently implementing two new brands of communities that target various customer preferences we cannot assure that these brands will be successful or that our costs in developing and implementing these brands will result in incremental revenue and earnings 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 communities—other land and real estate assets in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with an investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds  

we formed fund i and fund ii in which we have an equity interest of 152 and 313 respectively which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and in which we have an aggregate equity investment excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of each respective fund of approximately 129059000 net of distributions to us at december 31 2012 the investment period for both funds is over these funds present risks including the following 

• our subsidiaries that are the general partners of the funds are generally liable under partnership law for the debts and obligations of the respective funds subject to certain exculpation and indemnification rights pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the funds • investors in the funds holding a majority of the partnership interests may remove us as the general partner without cause subject to our right to receive an additional nine months of management fees after such removal and our right to acquire one of the properties then held by the funds • while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds the investors or an advisory committee comprised of representatives of the investors must approve certain matters and as a result we may be unable to cause the funds to implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial and • we may be liable andor our status as a reit may be jeopardized if either the funds or the reits through which a number of investors have invested in the funds and which we manage fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 communities—insurance and risk of uninsured losses many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in new england and the metro new yorknew jersey area we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice repair of water and wind damage from storms as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge such laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed and noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and 

maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties we currently do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of vapor intrusion at our communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

• the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities 22 

• no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments • no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared • the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities such as the presence of underground storage tanks will not affect the environmental condition of our communities • future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations will not result in the imposition of environmental liability and • no environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

breaches of our data security could materially harm our business and reputation 

we collect and retain certain personal information provided by our residents and employees while we have implemented a variety of security measures to protect the confidentiality of this information and periodically review and improve our security measures there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any breach of our data security measures and loss of this information may result in legal liability and costs including damages and penalties as well as damage to our reputation that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through our taxable reit subsidiaries or trss and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

in addition the archstone acquisition presents a risk to our qualification as a reit although we intend to structure our ownership and operations of the assets and entities acquired in connection with the archstone acquisition including our interest in joint ventures with equity residential in a way that would allow us to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes no assurances can be given that we will be successful 

as a result of the archstone acquisition and our ownership interests in the joint ventures with equity residential we expect to acquire interests in certain assets and earn certain items of income that are not or may not be qualifying assets or income for purposes of the reit asset and income tests although we do not expect that the amounts of such nonqualifying assets and income will jeopardize our reit status our review of the archstone acquisition is ongoing and we may discover additional nonqualifying assets or income we may not have the immediate right to change the terms of preexisting arrangements that generate nonqualifying items or may have to incur significant penalties to terminate such arrangements to maintain our reit qualification we may be required to hold significant assets acquired in connection with the archstone acquisition and some or all of our interests in the joint ventures with equity residential through our trss we also may hold certain archstone acquisition assets through our trss to avoid the risk of incurring the 100 prohibited transaction tax on any such assets that we sell at a gain our domestic trss are subject to us tax as regular corporations among the assets included in the archstone acquisition are subsidiaries intended to qualify as reits to the extent we hold such subsidiaries outside of our trss our reit qualification could depend in part on such subsidiaries compliance with the reit requirements before our purchase 

the assets of one of our joint ventures with equity residential are expected to include interests in a partnership controlled by equity residential as a result of our ownership interest in that joint venture for purposes of our compliance with the reit requirements we will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the assets of the equity residential partnership in which the joint venture has an interest although we expect equity residential to operate that partnership in compliance with the reit requirements because we do not expect to control the equity residential partnership in which the joint venture has an interest we cannot assure you that it will be operated in compliance with the reit requirements and failure to do so could potentially jeopardize our reit status 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address 

other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit our board of directors modified this ownership limit with respect to the common stock we expect to issue to lehman for the archstone acquisition these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

  current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

• established communities also known as same store communities are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year for the year ended december 31 2012 the established communities are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of january 1 2011 are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of i attainment of 95 physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment • other stabilized communities includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in and that have stabilized occupancy as defined above other stabilized communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year • leaseup communities are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached 95 • redevelopment communities are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year for communities that we wholly own redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of 5000000 or 10 of the communitys capitalized cost and is expected to have a material impact on the communitys operations and future rental rates the occupancy levels of redevelopment communities may also be impacted to the extent we take multiple apartment homes out of service for an extended period of time the definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities owned through a joint venture arrangement or by one of the funds   development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received for the entire community these communities may be partially complete and operating 

  development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

as of december 31 2012 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013 



1 in addition to the four communities indicated the company commenced the redevelopment of two communities with an aggregate of 1468 apartment homes during 2012 for which at december 31 2012 the redevelopment activity is focused on the common areas and is not impacting community operations including occupancy or rental revenue these communities are therefore included in the established community portfolio 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

we generally establish the composition of our established communities portfolio annually for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 there were 11 14 and 15 communities added respectively to the established communities portfolio and 17 communities removed in 2012 and seven communities removed in 2011 and 2010 from our established communities portfolio we anticipate that we will reset the composition of our established community portfolio effective both january 1 2014 and april 1 2014 the expected reset of the established community portfolio on april 1 2014 will occur as a result of the large number of stabilized communities we expect to acquire in the first quarter of 2013 as part of the archstone acquisition 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings 

as of january 31 2013 our current communities consisted of 119 gardenstyle of which 16 are mixed communities andor include town homes 22 highrise and 37 midrise apartment communities 

our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features which may include 

• fullyequipped kitchens • lofts and vaulted ceilings • walkin closets • fireplaces • patiosdecks and • modern appliances other features at various communities may include 

• swimming pools • fitness centers • tennis courts and • wifi lounges as described in item 1 we operate under three core brands avalon ava and eaves by avalon our core avalon brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services ava targets customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and generally features smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus eaves by avalon is targeted to the cost conscious value segment in suburban areas we believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013 



we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2012 we completed construction of 1934 apartment homes in eight communities and sold 1578 apartment homes in four communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 178 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the weighted average age of our current communities is 105 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2013 we owned 

• a full fee simple or absolute ownership interest in 151 operating communities ten of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in october 2026 november 2028 december 2034 december 2061 september 2065 april 2095 september 2105 april 2105 may 2105 and march 2142 • a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in both fund i and fund ii subsidiaries of fund i own a fee simple interest in ten operating communities and subsidiaries of fund ii own a fee simple interest in 12 operating communities • a general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a downreit as described more fully below that owns one community and • a membership interest in four limited liability companies that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community 29 

for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for the leases that expire in october 2026 november 2028 december 2034 and april 2095 we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 19 of the 23 development communities and a leasehold interest in four of the development communities with the land leases expiring in may 2041 july 2046 december 2086 and november 2106 two of the four land leases those expiring in 2046 and 2086 provide options for the company to purchase the land at some point during the lease term 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2013 there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes

1 we own a fee simple interest in the communities listed excepted as noted below the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013 2 represents a community that was under redevelopment during the year which could result in lower average economic occupancy and average rental rate per square foot for the year 3 represents a community that is under construction at 123112 or that completed development or was purchased during the year which could result in lower average economic occupancy and average rental rate per square foot for the year 4 represents the average rental revenue per occupied apartment home 5 dollars in thousands costs are presented in accordance with gaap for current development communities cost represents total costs incurred through december 31 2012 financial reporting costs are excluded for unconsolidated communities see note 5 investments in real estate entities 6 we own a 152 combined general partnership and indirect limited partner equity interest in this community 7 we own a general partnership interest in a partnership that owns a fee simple interest in this community 8 we own a general partnership interest in a partnership structured as a downreit that owns this community 9 we own a membership interest in a limited liability company that holds a fee simple interest in this community 10 community is located on land subject to a land lease 11 we own a 313 combined general partnership and indirect limited partner equity interest in this community 12 the funds sold these communities in 2013 

development communities 

as of december 31 2012 we had 23 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 6599 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 1832900000 in addition the land for four development communities that we control under longterm land lease agreements are subject to future minimum rental amounts of approximately 9302000 per year in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013 





1 total projected capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective development community determined in accordance with gaap including land acquisition costs or land lease costs through construction completion construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership either during construction or upon construction completion represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount 2 future projected initial occupancy dates are estimates there can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments 3 stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of 95 or greater physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of development 4 development community subject to a longterm ground lease 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2012 we had five consolidated communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 59800000 excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly for redevelopment communities we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate continuing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013 



1 total projected capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to redevelop the respective redevelopment community including land acquisition costs construction 

costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated redevelopment overhead and other regulatory fees all as determined in accordance with gaap 

2 restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of i attainment of 95 or greater physical occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of completion of redevelopment 3 the scope of work completed during 2012 did not impact occupancy or rental income therefore this community is included in the established community portfolio 

development rights 

at december 31 2012 we had 316037000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own and 24665000 in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through an option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 34 development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2012 includes 244015000 in original land acquisition costs the original land acquisition cost per home ranged from 9000 per home in connecticut to 149000 per home in new york city the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 9602 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own of the same brand group 

for 21 development rights we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land for the 13 remaining development rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions regarding the initial selection of a development right and whether or not to continue to invest in a development right are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery initial development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2012 we incurred a charge of approximately 1757000 for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 

you should carefully review section 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013 



1 total projected capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date if any and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community determined in accordance with gaap including land and related acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees 2 includes development rights in westchester county and rockland county ny 

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2012 we acquired land parcels for nine development rights including the final land parcels related to our purchase commitment for avalon willoughby square as shown in the table below for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 100564000 for eight of the nine parcels construction has either started or will start within the next 12 months the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013 



1 total projected capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date if any and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community determined in accordance with gaap including land and related acquisition costs construction costs real estate taxes capitalized interest and loan fees permits professional fees allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees 2 represents the final parcels purchased under our long term purchase commitment 

other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately 23964000 that we do not currently plan to develop these parcels consist of land that we i originally planned to develop and ii ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop the current carrying value of these land parcels reflects impairment charges of 9057000 incurred in prior periods we believe that the current carrying value for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment 

in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

recent disposition activity 

we i sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development or redevelopment activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2012 to january 31 2013 we sold our interest in four whollyowned communities containing 1578 apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 268250000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in managements view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a risk factors of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a 100000000 limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate in california the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 350000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional selfinsured retention until the total incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1400000 

in may 2012 we renewed our property insurance policy with no material change in coverage in august 2012 we renewed our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies with no material change in coverage 

in october 2012 superstorm sandy impacted several apartment communities in the companys midatlantic and northeast portfolios the company recognized a casualty loss of 1449000 for losses incurred related to superstorm sandy as of the date of this filing the company does not expect to recognize significant additional costs related to the damage from superstorm sandy 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program until 2014 in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 250000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as noncertified terrorism insurance is 

subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the companys related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a risk factors—we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 5000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property

executive overview 

as discussed under item 1 business we executed the purchase agreement under which we expect to acquire direct and indirect interests in certain operating and development communities from archstone we expect this transaction will close in the first quarter of 2013 the impact of the archstone acquisition is expected to significantly change the scope of our business and as a result our 2012 results of operations may not necessarily be representative of our future results of operations unless otherwise stated all disclosures and discussion in this form 10k do not include the expected effects of the archstone acquisition 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when pricing is attractive or when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

our strategy is to be a leader in multifamily market research consumer insight and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming submarkets of the united states our communities are predominately upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our markets our current markets include new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states 

financial highlights 

for the year ended december 31 2012 net income attributable to common stockholders was 423869000 compared to 441622000 for 2011 a decrease of 40 the decrease was due primarily to decreased gains on sale of communities in 2012 as compared to 2011 and acquisition costs for the expected archstone acquisition offset partially by an increase in net operating income noi from both established and newly stabilized communities 

apartment fundamentals improved throughout 2012 as compared to 2011 driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product full year 2012 established communities noi increased 76 over the prior year across all of our markets as a result of an increase in rental revenue offset partially by an increase in operating expenses 

during 2012 we raised approximately 3370000000 of capital through the issuance of common equity and unsecured notes and asset sales proceeds were used to prefund our expected portion of the acquisition of archstone to fund current investment activities and to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt both at or prior to their stated maturity we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of four communities and one land parcel for a gross sales price of 280550000 

we believe our development activity will continue to create longterm value we increased development activity during 2012 from the prior year in anticipation of favorable economic conditions and apartment fundamentals during 2012 we completed the development of eight communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 513100000 we also started the development of twelve communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 891300000 in addition during 2012 we completed the redevelopment of eleven communities for a total investment of 105900000 excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

we believe that our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provides flexibility in our capital raising activities we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of unsecured debt andor common and preferred equity andor secured debt as well as from disposition proceeds joint venture investments or from retained cash these sources will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2013 

with the completion of the investment period for fund ii in 2011 we became active again in acquiring whollyowned apartment communities directly purchasing the following four apartment communities during 2012 one of which occurred through a purchase of our joint venture partners interest 

• the mark pasadena located in pasadena ca which contains 84 apartment homes was acquired for a purchase price of 19400000 in conjunction with this acquisition we assumed the existing 461 fixedrate mortgage loan with an outstanding principal amount of 11958000 which matures in june 2018 and is secured by the community • eaves cerritos located in artesia ca which contains 151 apartment homes was acquired for a purchase price of 29500000 • eaves burlington located in burlington ma which contains 203 homes was acquired for a purchase price of 40250000 • the company acquired avalon del rey a 309 apartment home community which was owned by a joint venture in which we held a 30 ownership interest as part of this transaction the 51 

venture repaid the 43606000 variable rate note secured by the community we paid approximately 67200000 for the joint venture partners 70 interest as well as contributing our proportionate share of the note repayment to the venture upon the acquisition of avalon del rey we consolidated the community 

we established fund i and fund ii to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i it enables us to access thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii it provides us with additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds and iii it gives us greater visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets which helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund i has nine institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund i we have made an equity investment of approximately 21100000 in fund i net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a fund i community representing a 1515 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i has a term that expires in march 2013 plus two oneyear extension options 

during 2012 fund i sold six communities 

• avalon lakeside a 204 apartment home community in chicago il for 20500000 • avalon at poplar creek a 196 apartment home community in chicago il for 27200000 • avalon lombard a 256 apartment home community in chicago il for 35450000 • avalon paseo place a 134 apartment home community in fremont ca for 30900000 • avalon skyway a 348 apartment home community in san jose ca for 90900000 and • avalon at aberdeen station a 290 apartment home community in aberdeen nj for 66250000 our proportionate share of the gain from the sale of these communities was 7971000 in conjunction with the disposition of these communities fund i repaid 89142000 of the related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates incurring charges for prepayment penalties and write off of deferred financing costs of which our portion was approximately 530000 reported as a reduction of equity in income of unconsolidated entities 

in addition in 2013 fund i sold avalon at yerba buena located in san francisco ca avalon at yerba buena contains 160 apartment homes and 32000 square feet of retail space and was sold for 103000000 

fund ii has six institutional investors including us one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund ii we have made an equity investment of 107938000 net of distributions representing a 313 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquired investment interests in apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in august 2011 

during the year ended december 31 2012 a subsidiary of fund ii acquired avalon watchung a 334 apartment home community located in watchung nj for 63000000 this was the final acquisition for fund ii 

in 2013 fund ii sold avalon rothbury a 205 apartment home community located in gaithersburg md for 39600000 

we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new third fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions however we may acquire investments in existing fund structures in connection with the archstone acquisition but these funds are not expected to limit our ability to acquire investments for our own account 

communities overview 

as of december 31 2012 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 203 apartment communities containing 59391 apartment homes in nine states and the district of columbia of which 23 communities were under construction and five communities were under reconstruction of these communities 26 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including 11 owned by subsidiaries of fund i and 13 owned by subsidiaries of fund ii in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 34 whollyowned communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 9602 apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities development communities and development rights our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 8 segment reporting of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in liquidity and capital resources 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2012 2011 and 2010 follows dollars in thousands 



  net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 17753000 or 40 to 423869000 in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year offset partially by increased noi in 2012 over 2011 net income attributable to common stockholders increased 266291000 or 1519 in 2011 over 2010 due primarily to an increase in gain on sale of communities and increased noi in 2011 over 2010 

  noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy 

comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 



the noi increases for both 2012 and 2011 as compared to the prior year period consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 



the noi increase for established communities in 2012 is due to a combination of increased rental revenues offset partially by increased operating expenses during 2012 we experienced sequential annual increases in rental rates over 2011 while maintaining occupancy of at least 95 in all markets offset partially by an increase in operating expenses 

  rental and other income increased in both 2012 and 2011 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities and increases in rental rates at our established communities 

overall portfolio—the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 43411 apartment homes for 2012 as compared to 42613 homes for 2011 and 40489 homes for 2010 the increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities offset partially by communities sold during 2012 and 2011 the weighted 

average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 2017 for 2012 as compared to 1911 in 2011 and 1823 in 2010 

established communities—rental revenue increased 41698000 or 58 for 2012 and increased 33335000 or 51 for 2011 as compared to the respective prior years for 2012 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 56 to 2092 compared to 1981 in 2011 coupled with an increase in economic occupancy of 02 to 961 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in 2012 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region which accounted for approximately 301 of established community rental revenue for 2012 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 55 for 2012 as compared to 2011 average rental rates increased 52 to 2548 over 2011 and economic occupancy increased 03 to 964 for 2012 as compared to 2011 while there has not been significant job growth in the financial services sector of the metro new yorknew jersey region job growth in the technology sector continues to support the improvement in apartment fundamentals in new york city and northern new jersey 

the new england region accounted for approximately 220 of the established community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 42 over the prior year average rental rates increased 46 to 2073 offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of 04 to 957 for 2012 as compared to 2011 the new england regions growth is driven by a renewed expansion in employment for the technology sector primarily in the greater boston area offset somewhat by weakness in the financial services sector impacting the fairfieldnew haven area we expect continued but moderating revenue growth with the increasing affordability of home ownership and future supply from new development impacting the longer term outlook 

northern california accounted for approximately 170 of the established community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 101 over the prior year average rental rates increased 100 to 2151 and economic occupancy increased 01 to 961 for 2012 as compared to 2011 the growth in rental revenue is driven by the strength of northern californias technology sector which we expect will continue in 2013 an increase in development activity and future supply may slow revenue growth in future periods 

the midatlantic region which represented approximately 136 of established community rental revenue during 2012 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 36 as compared to 2011 average rental rates increased by 32 to 1900 and economic occupancy increased 04 to 959 for 2012 as compared to 2011 the midatlantic region is facing challenges resulting from additional supply due to new development and the uncertainty surrounding federal spending we expect these factors will result in revenue growth at a slower pace relative to our other markets during 2013 

southern california accounted for approximately 130 of the established community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 49 over the prior year average rental rates increased 45 to 1753 and economic occupancy increased 04 to 963 for 2012 as compared to 2011 the improvement in the southern california market is driven by above average job growth and limited new supply and we expect this trend will continue into 2013 

the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 43 of the established community rental revenue for 2012 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 96 over the prior year average rental rates increased 83 to 1493 and economic occupancy increased by 13 to 963 for 2012 as compared to 2011 the pacific northwests retail technology and manufacturing sectors continue to support job creation and apartment fundamentals consistent with several of our other markets new development and resulting additional supply may moderate revenue growth in future periods 

  management development and other fees increased 601000 or 62 in 2012 over 2011 and 2302000 or 313 in 2011 over 2010 the increases in both years were due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from fund ii over the prior years 

  direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 9455000 or 45 in 2012 and increased 7007000 or 35 for 2011 as compared to the prior years primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes decreased 475000 or 03 for 2012 and decreased 2514000 or 16 for 2011 as compared to the prior years the decreases in 2012 and 2011 from the respective prior years were due to a decrease in utilities from milder temperatures and more favorable negotiated rates as well as decreased bad debt expense 

  property taxes increased 8568000 or 93 and 4704000 or 54 in 2012 and 2011 respectively over the prior years due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 

for established communities property taxes increased by 4581000 or 65 and decreased 631000 or 09 for 2012 and 2011 respectively as compared to the prior year the increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to appeals and settlements recognized in 2011 not present in 2012 coupled with increases in rates and assessments throughout our regions the decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due to the appeals and settlements recognized in 2011 not present in 2010 offset partially by increased rates and assessments across all of our regions 

  corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by 1980000 or 49 and 2926000 or 78 in 2012 and 2011 respectively over the prior years the increases in 2012 and 2011 from the prior years are due primarily to increases in costs associated with our introduction and implementation of our ava and eaves by avalon brands and increases in compensation costs 

  investments and investment management costs increased by 945000 or 184 and 1302000 or 340 in 2012 and 2011 respectively over the prior years due primarily to increases in compensation costs 

  expensed acquisition development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for acquisitions of operating real estate and abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period these costs increased 8383000 or 2825 in 2012 over 2011 due primarily to costs associated with the archstone acquisition 

  interest expense net decreased 30894000 or 184 and decreased 2183000 or 13 in 2012 and 2011 respectively as compared to the prior years the decreases in 2012 and 2011 from the prior years are due primarily to decreases in the average outstanding indebtedness and lower average effective interest rates coupled with increases in the amount of capitalized interest the increases in capitalized interest over the respective prior years were driven primarily by the increase in our development activity and development pursuits the yearoveryear decrease in interest expense net in 2012 from 2011 was offset somewhat by interest income associated with escrow accounts for certain tax exempt secured borrowings recognized in 2011 that were not present in 2012 

  loss on the extinguishment of debt net reflects the impact from prepayment penalties expensing deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments above or below 

the carrying basis excluding assets sold or held for sale which is included in discontinued operations below during 2012 we recognized a noncash charge for the write off of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note in 2011 we incurred charges for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note with no comparable activity in 2010 

  depreciation expense increased in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities and acquisition activity offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during 2012 2011and 2010 

  general and administrative expense ga increased 4730000 or 161 in 2012 and 2525000 or 94 in 2011 as compared to the prior years the increases in both periods are attributable to increased compensation expense and professional fees 

  casualty and impairment loss for 2012 consists of the losses we incurred associated with superstorm sandy amounts for 2011 are composed of the write down of two land parcels and an other than temporary impairment of an investment in unconsolidated joint venture 

  gain on sale of land decreased in 2012 and increased in 2011 as compared to the prior years due to the volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels in each of the respective years 

  gain on acquisition of unconsolidated entity represents the amount by which the fair value of our prior ownership interest in the joint venture that owned avalon del rey exceeded our carrying value 

  equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased 15794000 or 3085 in 2012 and 4358000 or 5719 in 2011 as compared to prior years the increase in 2012 is due primarily to the recognition of income from our promoted interest for avalon del rey and an increase in our proportionate share of gains from fund i disposition activity over the prior year periods the increase in 2011 is due to the recognition of our proportionate share of the gain on sale of communities by fund i offset partially by increased acquisition costs from fund ii over 2010 

  income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2010 through december 31 2012 this income increased for 2012 and decreased for 2011 due to changes in the number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period see note 6 real estate disposition activities to our consolidated financial statements 

  gain on sale of communities decreased in 2012 and increased in 2011 as compared to the prior years due to a change in the volume of community disposition activity and associated gains as compared to the prior year the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 

  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in income to us from the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of 307000 in 2012 and 252000 in 2011 the decrease in loss allocated in 2011 relative to 2010 is due primarily to improved operating results of the fund i community we consolidate the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2011 and 2010 also contributed to the decrease in 2011 from 2010 thereby reducing outside ownership interest and the allocation of net losses to outside ownership interests 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

• the cash consideration due and any costs associated with the expected archstone acquisition as discussed in this form 10k or any additional liquidity needs associated with the expected archstone acquisition • development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged • the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the code • debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically prior to maturity and • normal recurring operating expenses factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended december 31 2012 net proceeds of approximately 3100458000 were provided by capital markets activity in 2012 capital raising activities included public equity and debt including amounts issued in an underwritten public offering of common stock in december 2012 the issuance of unsecured notes in september and december 2012 and the issuance of common stock during 2012 under cep ii and cep iii discussed below in 2013 we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including cash balances on hand asset sales and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below as well as our operating activities our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects at december 31 2012 we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 2733618000 available to fund the archstone acquisition to fund current liquidity needs as well as to fund development and acquisition related activities 

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 2733618000 at december 31 2012 an increase of 2116765000 from 616853000 at december 31 2011 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities—net cash provided by operating activities increased to 540819000 in 2012 from 429354000 in 2011 the increase was driven primarily by increased cash flows from community operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 and the timing of general corporate expenditures 

investing activities—net cash used in investing activities of 623386000 in 2012 related to investments in assets through development redevelopment and acquisitions partially offset by 

proceeds of 274018000 from the sale of real estate in total we invested 937946000 during 2012 in the following areas 

• we invested approximately 755363000 in the development and redevelopment of communities • we invested 155755000 in the acquisition of four apartment communities acquisition costs associated with these acquisitions and costs related to the expected archstone acquisition and • we had capital expenditures of 26528000 for real estate and nonreal estate assets financing activities—net cash provided by financing activities totaled 2199332000 in 2012 the net cash provided is due to 2430190000 received from the issuance of common stock primarily through the underwritten common equity offering we executed in november 2012 through cep ii and cep iii and stock option exercises and the proceeds from our 450000000 and 250000000 unsecured notes offerings these proceeds were offset partially by 365572000 of dividends paid repayment of unsecured notes of 381001000 the repayment of mortgage notes payable of 110013000 and the settlement of an interest rate contract for 54930000 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

in september 2011 we entered into a 750000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility in december 2012 pursuant to an option available under the terms of the credit facility with the approval of the lending syndicate we expanded the aggregate facility size to 1300000000 extended the maturity of the credit facility from september 2015 to april 2017 and amended other sections of the credit facility the facility increase we may further extend the term for up to two additional six month periods for a total extension of one year provided we are not in default and upon payment of a 975000 extension fee for each extension option 

in connection with the facility increase the applicable margin over reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates on our borrowings from time to time decreased the credit facility now bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 105 per annum 125 on january 31 2013 the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus 095 to libor plus 1725 based on our credit ratings in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to 65 of the credit facility amount which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate if market conditions allow in connection with the facility increase the annual facility fee was also amended to lower the fee from 0175 to 015 approximately 1950000 based on the 1300000000 facility size and based on our current credit rating 

we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 42575000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2013 

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the financial covenants include the following 

• limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure • limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by propertyspecific financing and 60 

• minimum levels of debt service coverage we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2012 

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in november 2010 we commenced our second continuous equity program cep ii under which we were authorized to sell up to 500000000 of our common stock from time to time during a 36month period in conjunction with cep ii we engaged sales agents who received compensation of approximately 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold for the year ended december 31 2012 we sold 1435215 shares under cep ii at an average sales price of 14041 per share for aggregate net proceeds of 198489000 from program inception in november 2010 through completion in july 2012 we sold 3925980 shares at an average price of 12736 per share for aggregate net proceeds of 492490000 

in august 2012 we commenced our third continuous equity program cep iii under which we may sell up to 750000000 of shares of our common stock during a 36month period in conjunction with cep iii we have engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold from program inception through december 31 2012 we sold 729991 shares at an average sales price of 14209 for net proceeds of 102168000 

underwritten public offering of common stock 

in december 2012 we issued 16675000 shares of our common stock at 13000 per share net proceeds of approximately 2102718000 are expected to be used to repay a portion of the debt we expect to assume in connection with the archstone acquisition to fund the cash consideration due in connection with the archstone acquisition to fund the fees costs and expenses related thereto or if the acquisition does not occur for general corporate purposes 

future financing and capital needs—debt and derivative maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities borrowings under our credit facility or by equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

we are also party to a 215000000 forward interest rate swap agreement which was executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2013 in 2013 based on changes in our capital markets outlook for the year coupled with our current liquidity position it is now uncertain as to whether we will issue the anticipated debt for which this interest rate protection agreement was transacted we expect to settle this position at or prior to its maturity in may 2013 for the fair value at the time of settlement at the point that we deem the 

anticipated debt issuance probable of not occurring we will record a charge for the reversal of the amount recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income for the forward interest swap agreement if we do issue the debt as previously anticipated then the amounts recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized as interest expense over the term of the debt as of january 31 2013 we had recorded a liability related to the value of this contract of 49675000 

in conjunction with our issuance of unsecured notes in september 2012 discussed below we cash settled a liability associated with a second 215000000 forward interest rate swap contract to which we were a party in september 2012 for 54930000 

in addition to the proceeds received from the common equity offering we completed in december 2012 and from the cep ii and cep iii offerings during 2012 and the forward interest rate swap agreement discussed above the following financing activity occurred during 2012 

• in january 2012 we repaid 179400000 principal amount of 55 unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity • in february 2012 in conjunction with the acquisition of a community we assumed the existing 461 mortgage note in the amount of 11958000 that matures in june 2018 and is secured by the community • also in february 2012 we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of 48500000 in advance of its november 2039 scheduled maturity date in conjunction with the early retirement we incurred a noncash charge of 1179000 for the write off of deferred financing fees which was recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income • in may 2012 we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of 14566000 in accordance with its scheduled maturity date • also in may 2012 in conjunction with the disposition of an operating community we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of 33100000 in advance of its scheduled maturity date we incurred a charge of 602000 for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees associated with the early repayment of this note included in income from discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income • in september 2012 we issued 450000000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement the notes mature in september 2022 and were issued at a 295 interest rate the notes have an effective interest rate of approximately 430 including the effect of the interest rate hedge discussed above and offering costs • in november 2012 we repaid 201601000 principal amount of 6125 unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity • in december 2012 we issued 250000000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement the notes mature in march 2023 and were issued at a 285 interest rate the notes have an effective interest rate of 300 including the effect of offering costs the following table details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2012 dollars in thousands we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest of the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have any equity or other interest the information presented in this table may materially change as a result of the expected archstone acquisition which we anticipate will occur in the first quarter of 2013

future financing and capital needs—portfolio and other activity 

as discussed in this form 10k we have entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain of archstones net assets see discussion under contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2012 we had 23 whollyowned communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 983079000 remained to be invested we also had five whollyowned communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 43090000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

• our 1300000000 credit facility until it expires in 2017 • cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements and shortterm investment vehicles • retained operating cash • the net proceeds from sales of existing communities • the issuance of debt or equity securities andor • private equity funding including joint venture activity before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to communities owned by the funds or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring specific development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

as of december 31 2012 we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interest percentages ranging from 152 to 313 we account for these investments in unconsolidated real estate entities under the equity method of accounting refer to note 5 investments in real estate entities of the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results

• our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness • we may be unsuccessful in our management of fund i fund ii or the reit vehicles that are used with each respective fund and • we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition in addition any forwardlooking statements or forecasts relating to the business prospects operating statistics or financial results that relate to or may be expected to result from the archstone acquisition are based on expectations forecasts and assumptions that are inherently speculative and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties many of which we cannot predict with accuracy and some of which we may not have anticipated as a result the actual operating statistics and financial results that relate to or may be expected to result from the archstone acquisition may differ materially from the companys forecasts risks uncertainties and other factors related to the archstone acquisition that might cause such differences include among other things the following the archstone acquisition may not close at the time or on the terms that we currently expect assumptions concerning the availability andor terms of financing including among other things obtaining lender consents to the assumption of indebtedness related to the archstone acquisition may not be realized obtaining joint venture partner consents to the assumption of partnership interest related to the archstone acquisitions may not be realized we may not be able to integrate the assets and operations acquired in the archstone acquisition in a manner consistent with our assumptions andor we may fail to achieve expected efficiencies and synergies we may encounter liabilities related to the archstone acquisition for which we may be responsible that were unknown to us at the time we agreed to the archstone acquisition or at the time of this report and our assumptions concerning risks relating to our lack of control of joint ventures and our ability to successfully dispose of certain assets may not be realized 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 organization and basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2012 our assets would have increased by 1280984000 and our liabilities would have increased by 963664000 we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

• for entities not considered to be variable interest entities the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary • for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting andor variable interest the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting andor variable interest we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any project specific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total 26513000 23984000 and 21475000 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2012 our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our operating expenses would have increased by 2651000 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2012 would have decreased by 2467000 

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist such assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property based on periodic tests of recoverability of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we did not record any impairment losses for whollyowned operating real estate assets 

we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits in the amounts of 1757000 in 2012 1957000 in 2011 and 2741000 in 2010 these costs are included in operating expenses excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

we also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land we did not recognize any impairment charges for land holdings in 2012 or 2010 during 2011 we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels and as a result that the carrying bases of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable as a result we recognized an aggregate charge of 12097000 for the impairment of these land parcels we had previously recognized an impairment loss of 9952000 in 2008 when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis for the land parcels existed we looked to a combination of internal models and thirdparty pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using thirdparty estimates 

of fair value for the internally generated fair values we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community the cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying asset as well as potential disposition proceeds the thirdparty values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy 

we also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments during 2011 we concluded that because the market for forsale housing development had not improved as expected the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary as a result we recognized a charge of 1955000 for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture there were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during 2012 or 2010 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a risk factors of this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2012 our net income would have decreased by approximately 170400000 

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 

acquisition of investments in real estate 

we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement which requires the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value typical assets and liabilities acquired include land building furniture fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovebelow market leases and inplace leases in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes in the second quarter of 2011 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on our expected issuance of debt in future periods in addition we have interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that serve to either convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings or effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

we had 476935000 and 548341000 in variable rate debt outstanding including fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements as of 2012 and 2011 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2012 and 2011 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 3969000 and 6534000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

as of december 31 2011 we had entered into fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge fair value exposure for approximately 75000000 of our fixed rate unsecured notes with no similar positions at december 31 2012 had the fixed interest rate swap agreements used to hedge fair value exposure not been in place during 2011 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 1765000 higher based on balances outstanding in 2011 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 3854068000 at december 31 2012 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 4077397000 at december 31 2012 contractual fixed rate debt represented 3377133000 of the carrying value and 3685629000 of the fair value at december 31 2012 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2012 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 175930000

 item 1 business tableend general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states these barriers to entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in the following regions of the united states new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the washington dc metro area the pacific northwest northern and southern california and currently the midwest we focus on these markets because we believe that over the longterm a limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in higher growth in cash flows relative to other markets 

at january 31 2012 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

  

  

 we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value through the development redevelopment acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartments in our markets to help meet this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire an interest in apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital our strategy is to be leaders in multifamily market research consumer insight and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings 

  

tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming us submarkets a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

in late 2011 we announced two new apartment community brands that will complement our traditional “avalon” brand we believe that this branding segmentation will allow us to better target our product offerings to multiple customer segments and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint the “avalon” brand will remain our core offering focusing on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services in urban and suburban markets our new “ava” brand is designed for people who want to live in or near urban neighborhoods and in close proximity to public transportation services shopping and nightlife ava apartments will generally be smaller many engineered for roommate living and will feature modern design and a technology focus our “eaves by avalon” brand is designed for renters who seek good quality apartment living often in a suburban setting with practical amenities and services at a more modest price point 

during the three years ended december 31 2011 excluding activity for the funds as defined below we acquired one apartment community during the same threeyear period excluding dispositions in which we retained an ownership interest we disposed of 11 apartment communities and completed the development of 19 apartment communities and the redevelopment of 16 apartment communities in addition we exchanged a portfolio of three communities and a parcel of land we owned for a portfolio of six communities and 26000000 in cash 

during this period we also realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of two communities owned by avalonbay value added fund lp “fund i” an institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 152 interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i acquired 20 communities fund i sold one community in 2008 two communities in 2011 and two communities in 2012 through the date this form 10k was filed 

in addition during this period we obtained an investment interest in communities through avalonbay value added fund ii lp “fund ii” a second institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 313 interest while the investment period for fund ii closed in august 2011 additional acquisitions may occur for active acquisition candidates identified prior to the end of the investment period from the commencement of fund ii through december 31 2011 fund ii acquired 12 operating communities in 2012 the company expects fund ii to acquire its final operating community which was an active acquisition candidate at the end of the investment period for fund ii a more detailed description of fund i and fund ii collectively the “funds” and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

excluding the portfolio exchange discussed above and including sales by unconsolidated entities during 2011 we sold eight real estate assets consisting of five operating communities and three land parcels resulting in a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of 290194000 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

  

development strategy  we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors as construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development any net revenue from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as unimproved ground floor retail space municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have established a dedicated group of associates and procedures to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phases 

  

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy  we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new third fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

property management strategy  we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

  

  

  

 constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income “noi” produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction as a reit we generally cannot provide direct services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy  we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 750000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general 

  

market and economic conditions our short and longterm liquidity needs the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

in addition from time to time we may offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

other strategies and activities  while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or iii some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes as of december 31 2011 we had a total of 530604 square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under construction gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2011 was 8131000 08 of total revenue we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail component of a mixeduse building that we help develop if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 or the treasury regulations our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “the code” and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

  

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors tableend our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt as well as effective variable interest rate debt achieved through the use of qualifying hedging relationships in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2011 approximately 611 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank jpmorgan chase bank na as a bank and as syndication agent deutsche bank trust company americas morgan stanley bank and wells fargo bank na each as a bank and as documentation agent barclays bank plc as a bank and as codocumentation agent ubs securities llc as a codocumentation agent the bank of new york mellon bbva compass bank pnc bank national association and suntrust bank each as a bank and as a managing agent branch banking and trust company bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj ltd and citizens bank each as a bank and as a coagent and the other bank parties signatory thereto our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of i the stated maturity of the note or ii the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment if we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

there are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which include their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality amount of real estate under development and sustainability of cash flow and earnings among other factors if market conditions change we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

we could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac 

fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of secured financing to the multifamily industry and we have used fannie mae and freddie mac for a portion of our financing needs in february 2011 the obama administration released a report calling for the winding down of the role that fannie mae and freddie mac play in the mortgage market a final decision by the government to eliminate fannie mae or freddie mac or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of multifamily community loans may adversely affect interest rates capital availability and the value of multifamily communities 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or other liquidity needs including the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

  

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

  

 failure to succeed in new markets or with new brands and community formats or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

although we are primarily in the multifamily business we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments we also may engage or have an interest in forsale activity we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are currently implementing two new brands of communities that target various customer preferences we cannot assure that these brands will be successful or that our costs in developing and implementing these brands will result in incremental revenue and earnings 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “communities – other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcel’s then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with an investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds 

we formed fund i and fund ii in which we have an equity interest of 152 and 313 respectively which through whollyowned subsidiaries we manage as the general partner and in which we have invested an aggregate of approximately 146465000 net of distributions to us at december 31 2011 the investment period for both funds is over these funds present risks including the following 

 

   

  

  

 risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 “communities – insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in new england the new york and new jersey metro area and the midwest we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

  

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

we are also aware that environmental agencies and third parties have in the case of certain properties with onsite or nearby contamination asserted claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties we currently do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of vapor intrusion at our communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our board of directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the company 

breaches of our data security could materially harm our business and reputation 

we collect and retain certain personal information provided by our tenants and employees while we have implemented a variety of security measures to protect the confidentiality of this information and periodically review and improve our security measures there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information any breach of our data security measures and loss of this information may result in legal liability and costs including damages and penalties as well as damage to our reputation that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may engage in activities that are not customarily provided by a landlord through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

  

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director in a contested election if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast the incumbent directors would remain in office this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders’ best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

 our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 

  

  

  

 development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received for the entire community these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

  

as of december 31 2011 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 

 

  

 our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

current communities 

our current communities include gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of multistory buildings in landscaped settings as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings as of january 31 2012 our current communities consisted of 126 gardenstyle of which 16 are mixed communities andor include town homes 22 highrise and 32 midrise apartment communities 

our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features which may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 other features at various communities may include 

 

  

  

  

   

as described in item 1 in late 2011 we announced the introduction of two new brands to supplement our core avalon offering which remains focused on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services “ava” will target customers in high energy transitserved urban neighborhoods and will feature smaller apartments many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus “eaves by avalon” is targeted to the cost conscious “value” segment and will likely be concentrated in older assets in suburban areas we believe that the addition of these new brands will allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by segmenting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 

 

 we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2011 we completed construction of 1161 apartment homes in six communities sold 1313 apartment homes in five communities and exchanged three communities with 1060 apartment homes for six communities with 1418 apartment homes with another apartment owner the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 17 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the average age of our current communities is 11 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2012 we owned 

 

   

  

  

  

 for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for the leases that expire in october 2026 november 2028 december 2034 and april 2095 we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 16 of the 19 development communities and a leasehold interest in three of the development communities with the land leases expiring in july 2046 november 2106 and may 2041 two of the three land leases those expiring in 2041 and 2046 provide options for the company to purchase the land at some point during the lease term 

in our partnership structured as a downreit one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner under the partnership agreement for the downreit the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2012 there were 7500 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes

development communities 

as of december 31 2011 we had 19 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 5244 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 1464700000 in addition the land for three development communities that we control under longterm land lease agreements are subject to future minimum rental amounts of approximately 8300000 per year in aggregate you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of our 2012 outlook for development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 

 

  

      

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2011 we had 13 consolidated communities including two phases of a community being redeveloped under a single project under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 126700000 excluding costs prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly for redevelopment communities we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate continuing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 1  

 

  

    development rights 

at december 31 2011 we had 325918000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own and 24770000 in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through an option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 32 development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative 

  

capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2011 includes 260684000 in original land acquisition costs we also have 27707000 in future land acquisition costs under our commitment related to a development right in brooklyn ny as discussed under “offbalance sheet arrangements” elsewhere within this form 10k the original land acquisition cost per home including our obligation under the commitment ranged from 9000 per home in connecticut to 149000 per home in new york city the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 9012 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 17 development rights we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land for the 15 remaining development rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions regarding the initial selection of a development right and whether or not to continue to invest in a development right are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery initial development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2011 we incurred a charge of approximately 1957000 of predevelopment cost for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 

you should carefully review section 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

 

  

    

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2011 we acquired 14 land parcels for development as shown in the table below for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 212256000 for 13 of the 14 parcels construction has either started or will start within the next 12 months 

 

  

 other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately 52088000 that we do not currently plan to develop these parcels consist of land that we i originally planned to develop and ii ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop as more fully described below 

i the land that we originally acquired for future development has an original cost of 60821000 and a current carrying value of 31989000 and is comprised of four parcels originally intended for the development of approximately 1800 apartment homes the current carrying value of these land parcels reflects impairment charges of 28832000 incurred in 2011 and prior periods 

ii the out parcels and certain other land parcels that we acquired in connection with various development pursuits without a view to developing have a current carrying value of 20099000 which reflects impairment charges of 8341000 incurred in prior periods 

  

we believe that the current carrying value of 52088000 for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

recent disposition activity 

we i sell assets when they do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2011 to january 31 2012 we sold our interest in three whollyowned communities containing 1313 apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 258490000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a 100000000 limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate in california the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 350000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional selfinsured retention until the total incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1400000 

on january 15 2011 we elected to extend our property insurance policy for a new 16 month term in order to take advantage of market conditions as a result our property insurance premium decreased by approximately 10 with no material changes in coverage market conditions in 2012 are less favorable than when we last renewed our property insurance coverage and we expect an increase in insurance costs when we renew this policy in may 2012 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program until 2014 in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 250000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors – we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

  

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 5000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property

executive overview 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when pricing is attractive or when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

our strategy is to be a leader in multifamily market research consumer insight and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming submarkets of the united states our communities are predominately upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are currently located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the midwest the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states at the present time we are no longer pursuing development or acquisition opportunities in the midwest region and we are currently marketing for sale or have executed a sales contract for two apartment communities which includes one for fund i and a land parcel located in that region should these assets sell during 2012 we would no longer have an investment interest in the midwest region 

financial highlights and outlook 

for the year ended december 31 2011 net income attributable to common stockholders was 441622000 compared to 175331000 for 2010 an increase of 1519 the increase was due primarily to increased gains on sale of communities in 2011 as compared to 2010 as well as from an increase in net operating income “noi” from both established and newly stabilized communities 

apartment fundamentals improved throughout 2011 as compared to 2010 driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product full year 2011 established communities noi increased 84 over the prior year across all of our markets as a result of an increase in rental revenue and a decrease in operating expenses 

we expect that earnings per share – diluted “eps” will increase to between 490 and 520 for 2012 from 487 in 2011 driven primarily by expected gains from the disposition of real estate and the continued improvement in revenue and noi from our established communities in 2012 this positive outlook is as of the date that this form 10k is filed and reflects our expectations for i moderate but accelerated job growth and population growth particularly in the age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent ii the expected weak 

  

but moderating conditions in the forsale housing market during 2012 and iii constrained levels of new supply our current financial outlook for 2012 provides for growth in rental revenue of between 50 and 65 in our established community portfolio resulting in a projected noi growth for our established communities of 60 to 80 expense growth also impacts growth in noi and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth we expect operating expenses to increase between 25 and 35 in 2012 over 2011 these projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in 2012 both nationally and in the markets where we operate the individual demandsupply characteristics of each submarket in which we operate and assessment of each community’s potential performance for the upcoming year we do not undertake a duty to update our outlook and there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions andor their impact on our operating results will be accurate and actual results could differ materially please see “risk factors” “forwardlooking statements” and other discussions in this report on form 10k for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations 

during 2011 we successfully raised approximately 1265000000 of capital through sales of common equity in the public markets and asset sales proceeds were used to fund current investment activities prefund planned investment activity and combined with cash already on hand to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes we believe that our current capital structure will provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of three communities and three land parcels for a gross sales price of 292965000 we expect to see continued strong investor demand for quality multifamily assets in 2012 due in part to the liquidity in the capital markets and constrained supply of quality multifamily assets resulting from the decline in development activity in 2008 and 2009 in all markets 

we increased development activity during 2011 from the prior year in anticipation of the further improvement in the economy and apartment fundamentals and believe that our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2011 we completed the development of six communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 297100000 which represents a savings from the original budgeted capitalized cost of 12100000 we started the development of 11 communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 892500000 in addition during 2011 we completed the redevelopment of seven communities for a total investment of 67500000 excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 

during 2012 we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the favorable market conditions expected in 2012 and 2013 we anticipate new development starts in 2012 with a total projected capitalized cost of 1000000000 to 1200000000 during 2012 we expect to invest between 750000000 and 850000000 related to the 19 communities under development at december 31 2011 new development starts and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development consistent with this view we also expect to maintain our current level of redevelopment activity for our whollyowned communities in 2012 during which we expect to start redevelopment of five whollyowned communities and invest between 100000000 and 150000000 in the redevelopment of communities 

we believe that our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provides us with flexibility in our capital raising activities we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of unsecured debt andor common and preferred equity andor secured debt as well as from disposition proceeds joint venture investments or from retained cash and that these sources will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2012 

we also increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through acquisitions in 2011 we completed an asset exchange with another apartment owner through this transaction we exchanged three existing communities and a small land parcel for six operating communities and 26000000 in cash the communities we provided to our exchange counterparty consisted of two properties and a small land parcel located in metropolitan boston and one property located in san francisco in exchange we received six operating communities in southern california los angeles orange county and san diego this transaction is consistent with our desire to increase our presence in southern california providing us with a larger portfolio of assets in the region at multiple price points that we believe will perform better than other us markets over the current operating cycle 

also in 2011 we acquired fairfax towers for our whollyowned portfolio fairfax towers is a highrise community consisting of 415 apartment homes located in falls church va and was acquired for a purchase price of 89200000 

  

in february 2012 we acquired for our whollyowned portfolio the mark pasadena located in pasadena ca the mark pasadena contains 84 apartment homes and was acquired for 19400000 

during 2012 we expect to be active in both acquisition and disposition activity for our whollyowned portfolio while this activity pertains primarily to portfolio shaping and repositioning and is currently expected to have a nominal impact on our net capital position we expect the dispositions to occur largely in the first half of the year and the acquisitions are expected to be weighted more towards the second half of the year 

we established fund i and fund ii to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds and iii visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund i has nine institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and we have made an equity investment of approximately 42100000 in fund i net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a fund i community representing a 1515 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i has a term that expires in march 2015 plus two oneyear extension options 

during 2011 fund i sold two communities 

 

  

 fund i recognized an aggregate gain under gaap of 22246000 from the sale of these communities of which our share was 3063000 

in addition fund i sold two communities in 2012 avalon lakeside located in chicago illinois was sold for 20500000 and avalon at poplar creek also located in chicago illinois was sold for 27200000 

fund ii has six institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and we have total equity commitments of 125000000 representing a 3125 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund ii has a term that expires in august 2018 plus two oneyear extension options fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle with some exceptions through which we acquired investment interests in apartment communities until august 2011 while the investment period for fund ii closed in august 2011 additional acquisitions may occur for active acquisition candidates identified prior to the end of the investment period in 2012 we expect fund ii to acquire its final operating community which was an active acquisition candidate at the end of the investment period for fund ii 

we will receive in addition to any returns on our invested equity asset management fees property management fees and redevelopment fees we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met during the year ended december 31 2011 subsidiaries of fund ii acquired the following four operating communities 

 

  

  

  

 we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new third fund preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of whollyowned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 

  

communities overview 

as of december 31 2011 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 200 apartment communities containing 58538 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which 19 communities were under construction and 13 communities were under reconstruction of these communities 32 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including 16 owned by subsidiaries of fund i and 12 owned by subsidiaries of fund ii in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 32 whollyowned communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 9012 apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities development communities and development rights our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2011 2010 and 2009 follows dollars in thousands 

  

 net income attributable to common stockholders increased 266291000 or 1519 to 441622000 in 2011 primarily due to an increase in gain on sale of communities and increased noi in 2011 over 2010 net income attributable to common stockholders increased 19684000 or 126 in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to an increase in gains on sale of real estate in 2010 and impairment losses recognized in 2009 with no comparable activity in 2010 as well as an increase in noi in 2010 over 2009 

noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

  

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 the noi increases for both 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior year period consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 

 

 the noi increase for established communities in 2011 is due to a combination of increased rental revenues and decreased operating expenses during 2011 we experienced sequential quarterly increases in rental rates while maintaining occupancy of at least 95 in all regions in addition we experienced favorable trends in operating expenses primarily property taxes and utilities 

rental and other income increased in both 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities and increases in rental rates at our established communities 

overall portfolio – the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 42613 apartment homes for 2011 as compared to 40489 homes for 2010 and 38233 homes for 2009 the increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities offset partially by communities sold during 2011 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 1911 for 2011 as compared to 1823 in 2010 and 1910 in 2009 

established communities – rental revenue increased 33335000 or 51 for 2011 and decreased 6137000 or 09 for 2010 as compared to the prior year for 2011 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 51 to 1939 compared to 1845 in 2010 driven by an increase in rental rates average economic occupancy for 2011 remained at 960 consistent with 2010 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in 2011 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

  

the metro new yorknew jersey region which accounted for approximately 283 of established community rental revenue for 2011 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 43 for 2011 as compared to 2010 average rental rates increased 43 to 2427 over 2010 and economic occupancy was unchanged at 961 during 2011 an improving economy favorable demographic trends and a minimal amount of competitive new supply supported positive results in 2011 over the prior year despite concerns about the nearterm recovery in the region’s large financial services industry the metro new yorknew jersey region has experienced growth in other sectors including technology which has supported demand for rental housing we anticipate the new york city market will continue to outperform suburban submarkets in 2012 new rental deliveries are expected to remain minimal in 2012 but we are anticipating completion and delivery of competitive new supply in certain new york city markets in 2013 

the new england region accounted for approximately 246 of the established community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 55 over the prior year average rental rates increased 56 to 2014 offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of 01 to 961 for 2011 as compared to 2010 job growth from the region’s large technology sector and a low volume of new multifamily supply contributed to the improvement in apartment market conditions job growth in the boston area was broadbased but southwest connecticut lagged given greater dependence on the financial services and manufacturing sectors similar conditions are expected in 2012 with large defense contractors headquartered in the region the potential for job cutbacks in the defense sector may negatively impact market fundamentals in 2012 

the midatlanticmidwest region which represented approximately 159 of established community rental revenue during 2011 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 47 as compared to 2010 average rental rates increased by 53 to 1814 while economic occupancy decreased 06 to 955 for 2011 as compared to 2010 the midatlantic region’s economy which is highly dependent on government and governmentcontractors is expected to underperform other regions as impacts from the current focus on controlling government spending take effect at the same time a significant amount of new rental supply is expected to be delivered in 2012 and 2013 in certain submarkets which will compete with existing product 

northern california accounted for approximately 149 of the established community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 72 from the prior year average rental rates increased 70 to 1849 and economic occupancy increased 02 to 961 for 2011 as compared to 2010 strong renter demand is being fueled by job growth in the region’s large hightech sector unaffordable home prices and a lack of competitive new rental supply we expect the region’s solid apartment market fundamentals will continue during 2012 we anticipate competitive new supply will be delivered in 2013 but will be limited to certain submarkets 

southern california accounted for approximately 109 of the established community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 39 from the prior year average rental rates increased 31 to 1626 and economic occupancy increased 08 to 961 for 2011 as compared to 2010 apartment market conditions are improving in the region as job growth resumes in line with a strengthening us economy we anticipate that stronger job growth in the region during 2012 combined with minimal new supply favorable demographics and a continued weak housing market will support stronger rental revenue growth 

the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 54 of the established community rental revenue for 2011 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 51 from the prior year average rental rates increased 54 to 1304 offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of 03 to 949 for 2011 as compared to 2010 job growth in the region is broadbased driven by improvement in both aerospace and technology population growth and limited competition from both new rental supply and home purchases are expected to support continued strong rental revenue growth new rental deliveries will be modest in 2012 but we expect an increase in 2013 in certain submarkets 

management development and other fees increased 2302000 or 313 in 2011 over 2010 the increase in 2011 was due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from fund ii 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 6656000 or 32 in 2011 and increased 11918000 or 60 for 2010 as compared to the prior years primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes 

  

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes decreased 2514000 or 16 to 154237000 for 2011 and increased 2282000 or 14 for 2010 as compared to the prior year periods the decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due primarily to decreased administrative expenses from a decrease in bad debt expense savings in utilities driven by milder temperatures and more favorable negotiated rates also contributed to the decrease the decrease in 2010 from 2009 was due primarily to decreased administrative and marketing costs offset partially by higher community maintenance expenses including costs for repairs from storm damage the decreases in administrative expenses were primarily due to decreased bad debt 

property taxes increased 4370000 or 48 and 9652000 or 118 in 2011 and 2010 respectively due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 

for established communities property taxes decreased by 631000 or 09 and increased 3455000 or 52 for 2011 and 2010 respectively as compared to the prior year the decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due to successful appeals and settlements offset partially by a combination of rate increases and higher assessments throughout all regions the increase in 2010 over 2009 is due to higher assessments as well as the size and timing of successful appeals we expect property taxes in 2012 to increase over 2011 due primarily to higher tax rates and higher assessments for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by 2926000 or 78 in 2011 over the prior year the increase in 2011 from 2010 is due primarily to increases in compensation costs coupled with costs associated with the company’s development and introduction of the ava and eaves by avalon brands 

investments and investment management costs increased in 2011 by 1302000 or 340 from the prior year due primarily to increases in compensation costs 

expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits expensed development and other pursuit costs decreased in 2011 and 2010 from the prior years due to decreases in abandoned development pursuits attributable to continued economic improvement these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period 

interest expense net decreased 2170000 or 13 and increased 24887000 or 171 in 2011 and 2010 respectively as compared to the prior years this category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized and interest income the decrease in 2011 from 2010 is due to a decrease in outstanding debt coupled with lower interest rates and an increase in interest costs capitalized over 2010 the increase in 2010 is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized as compared to the prior year coupled with increased interest expense in 2010 compared to the prior year from additional secured and unsecured debt issued the decrease in interest capitalized in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to the reduction in development activity in 2010 as compared to the prior year 

loss on the extinguishment of debt net reflects the impact from prepayment penalties and expensing of deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity or payments above or below the carrying basis in 2011 we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 1940000 due to early retirement of a secured note the net loss in 2009 is due to the 310100000 in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium offset by the gain recognized from our january 2009 tender offer 

depreciation expense increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities and acquisition activity offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during 2011 and 2010 

general and administrative expense “ga” increased 2525000 or 94 in 2011 and decreased 1902000 or 66 in 2010 as compared to the prior years the changes in both periods are attributable to changes in compensation expense 

  

impairment loss for 2011 was due to an additional write down of two land parcels for which we changed our intent and determined we now intend to pursue the disposal of these assets in addition the impairment charge in 2011 includes the impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture impairment loss for 2009 was due to the write down of land parcels which we concluded that we did not plan to develop at the time of impairment we did not recognize an impairment loss in 2010 

gain on sale of land increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010 as compared to the prior years due to the sale of land parcels in 2011 and 2009 without comparable activity in 2010 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased 4358000 or 5719 in 2011 and decreased 679000 or 471 in 2010 as compared to prior years the increase in 2011 is due to the recognition of our proportionate share of the gain on sale of two communities by fund i offset partially by increased acquisition costs from fund ii over 2010 the decrease in 2010 is due to acquisition costs from fund ii which were not significant in 2009 

income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2009 through december 31 2011 this income increased for 2011 and decreased for 2010 due to changes in the number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period see note 7 “real estate disposition activities” of our consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of communities increased in 2011 and 2010 as compared to the prior years as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area the gain on sale of communities in 2011 includes 122416000 for the recapture of cumulative straight line rent expense charged in excess of cash payments for a community subject to a longterm ground lease 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in income to us for the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of 252000 in 2011 and 1252000 in 2010 the decrease in income in 2011 relative to 2010 is due primarily to improved operating results of the fund i community we consolidate the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2011 and 2010 also contributed to the decrease in 2011 from 2010 thereby reducing outside ownership interest and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

  

  

  

 factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended december 31 2011 raising net proceeds of approximately 971925000 in the form of public equity including amounts issued in an underwritten public offering of common stock in august 2011 and amounts issued under the cep ii discussed below in 2012 we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including cash balances on hand asset sales and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below as well as our operating activities our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects at december 31 2011 we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 616890000 available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities 

  

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 616890000 at december 31 2011 an increase of 312483000 from 304407000 at december 31 2010 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities – net cash provided by operating activities increased to 429391000 in 2011 from 332106000 in 2010 the increase was driven primarily by the timing of general corporate expenditures and increased cash flows from community operations in 2011 as compared to 2010 

investing activities – net cash used in investing activities of 443141000 in 2011 related to investments in assets through development redevelopment and acquisitions in total we invested 737185000 during 2011 in the following areas 

 

  

  

  

 these expenditures were offset by net proceeds of 310228000 from an asset exchange and the disposition of three operating communities and three unimproved land parcels 

financing activities – net cash provided by financing activities totaled 326233000 in 2011 the net cash provided is due primarily to the issuance of common stock primarily through the underwritten common equity offering we executed in august 2011 and under cep ii for aggregate net proceeds of 1049835000 partially offset by the payment of cash dividends in the amount of 318231000 repayment of 189900000 principal amount of unsecured notes and repayment of 200166000 of secured notes including prepayment penalties 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

in september 2011 we entered into the credit facility which has an available borrowing capacity of 750000000 and a fouryear term plus a one year extension option we may elect to expand the facility to 1300000000 provided that one or more banks whether or not part of the current syndicate of banks voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit the increase which will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds the credit facility was entered into with a syndicate of commercial banks to whom we pay an annual facility fee of approximately 1313000 and bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 1075 per annum 134 on january 31 2012 the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus 100 to libor plus 185 based on our credit ratings in addition the credit facility includes a competitive bid option which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans to us at a rate that is lower than the stated rate provided by the credit facility for up to 487500000 the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing than the stated rate if market conditions allow we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had 49883000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january 31 2012 

the credit facility replaced our previous variable rate unsecured credit facility which had a borrowing capacity of 1000000000 the “cancelled credit facility” which was scheduled to expire in november 2011 

financial covenants 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the financial covenants include the following 

 

  

  

   

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2011 

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program cep ii 

in november 2010 we commenced cep ii under which we may sell up to 500000000 of our common stock from time to time during a 36month period actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep ii we engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold for the year ended december 31 2011 we sold 2057933 shares under cep ii at an average sales price of 12139 per share for aggregate net proceeds of 246065000 from program inception in november 2010 through december 31 2011 we sold 2490765 shares at an average price of 11984 per share for aggregate net proceeds of 294000000 

underwritten public offering of common stock 

in august 2011 we issued 5865000 shares of our common stock for a net price of 12825 per share before offering costs net proceeds of approximately 725860000 are being used for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes which may include development redevelopment and acquisitions of apartment communities and repayment and refinancing of debt 

future financing and capital needs – debt and derivative maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in 2009 if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our credit facility or by equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

we are also party to 430000000 of forward interest rate swap agreements which were executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2012 and 2013 at maturity of the agreements we will cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value assuming that we issue the debt as expected we will recognize in earnings the impact from settling these positions over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment our outlook for 2012 considered the expected impact for the settlement of the forward interest rate swap agreement that matures in 2012 at december 31 2011 we had recorded a liability related to the value of these contracts of 85467000 approximately half of which relates to the contract expiring in 2012 the value of the contracts is subject to increase or decrease prior to their respective maturities and the amount which we will pay or receive upon maturity will depend on market conditions at that time 

in addition to the proceeds received from the common equity offering we executed in august 2011 and under cep ii and the forward interest rate swap agreements discussed above the following financing activity occurred during 2011 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 the following debt activity occurred subsequent to december 31 2011 through the date this form 10k was filed 

 

  

  

 the following table details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2011 dollars in thousands we are not directly or indirectly as borrower or guarantor obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest of the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have any equity or other interest 

  

  

       

       future financing and capital needs – portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2011 we had 19 whollyowned communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 804231000 remained to be invested we also had 13 whollyowned communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 87646000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the funds or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring specific development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

unconsolidated real estate investments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

unconsolidated investments 

as of december 31 2011 we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interest percentages ranging from 152 to 313 we account for these investments in unconsolidated real estate entities under the equity method of accounting refer to note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report which includes information on the aggregate assets liabilities and equity as well as operating results and our proportionate share of their operating results 

  

detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table 

 

  

           

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 

  

 in addition as part of the formation of fund i we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee the guarantee provides that if upon final liquidation of fund i the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of fund i whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall but in no event more than 10 of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately 7500000 as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by fund i is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected fund i liquidation scenario the estimated fair value of and our obligation under this guarantee both at inception and as of december 31 2011was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december 31 2011 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 there are no other lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 

contractual obligations 

there have not been any material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2011 scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2011 dollars in thousands 

 

  

   

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases similarly in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and basis of presentation” of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2011 our assets would have increased by 1509069000 and our liabilities would have increased by 1101765000 we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

  

 we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan 

  

fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any project specific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities total 23984000 21475000 and 24932000 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2011 our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our operating expenses would have increased by 2398000 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2011 would have decreased by 2477000 

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we evaluate our real estate and other longlived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist such assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property based on periodic tests of recoverability of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we did not record any impairment losses for whollyowned operating real estate assets 

we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits in the amounts of 1957000 in 2011 2741000 in 2010 and 5842000 in 2009 these costs are included in operating expenses excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

we also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land during 2011 we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels and as a result that the carrying bases of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable as a result we recognized an aggregate charge of 12097000 for the impairment of these land parcels we had previously recognized an impairment loss of 9952000 in 2008 when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis for the land parcels existed we did not recognize any impairment charges for land holds in 2010 during 2009 we concluded that the economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning this resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of 21152000 in 2009 related to the impairment of land parcels which we concluded would not be developed at the dates of the impairment we looked to a combination of internal models and thirdparty pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using thirdparty estimates of fair value for the internally generated fair values we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community the cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash 

  

flows of the underlying asset as well as potential disposition proceeds the thirdparty values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy 

we also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment considering both the carrying value of the investment estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments during 2011 we concluded that because the market for forsale housing development has not improved as expected the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary as a result we recognized a charge of 1955000 for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture there were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31 2010 in 2009 an unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold an interest determined that the economic downturn impacted the recoverability of the carrying value of a long lived asset held as an investment accordingly the joint venture recognized an impairment loss we recognized our proportionate share of the impairment loss of approximately 2600000 as a component of equity in income of unconsolidated entities on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2011 our net income would have decreased by approximately 177500000 

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes in the second quarter of 2011 we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on our expected issuance of debt in future periods in addition we have interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that serve to either convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings convert fixed rate borrowings to floating rate borrowings or effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

  

we had 548341000 and 821381000 in variable rate debt outstanding including fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements as of 2011 and 2010 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2011 and 2010 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 6534000 and 8682000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

as of december 31 2011 we had a 430000000 of forward starting pay fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge cash flow variability for future debt issuances in addition we had executed receive fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge fair value exposure for approximately 75000000 and 225000000 of our fixed rate unsecured notes as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively had the receive fixed interest rate swap agreements used to hedge fair value exposure not been in place during 2011 and 2010 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 1765000 and 2121000 higher respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 3633125000 at december 31 2011 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 3838360000 at december 31 2011 contractual fixed rate debt excluding fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements represented 3084784000 of the carrying value and 3342104000 of the fair value at december 31 2011 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2011 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately  143278000

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states these barriers to entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the washington dc metro area the midwest the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states we focus on these markets because we believe that over the longterm a limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in higher growth in cash flows relative to other markets 

at january 31 2011 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

  

  

 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value through the development acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartments in our markets to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire an interest in apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital our strategy is to be leaders in market research and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming us submarkets a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

during the three years ended december 31 2010 excluding activity for the funds as defined below we did not acquire any apartment communities during the same threeyear period excluding dispositions in which we retained an ownership interest we disposed of 18 apartment communities and completed the development of 26 apartment communities and the redevelopment of 11 apartment communities 

during this period we also realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of one community owned by avalonbay value added fund lp “fund i” an institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 152 interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i acquired 20 communities fund i sold one community in 2008 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp “fund ii” an additional institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we currently own a 313 interest after adding additional equity commitments in the second quarter of 2009 a total of five institutional investors and the company collectively committed 400000000 of which our commitment is 125000000 from its formation through december 31 2010 fund ii acquired eight communities a more detailed description of fund i and fund ii collectively the “funds” and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion under item i “business – general – financing strategy” and note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

during 2010 we sold four real estate assets resulting in a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of 71399000 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

 

  

  

 

development strategy  we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in arlington virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a wholly owned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development the net revenue from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have established a dedicated group of associates and procedures to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phases 

  

  

 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy    we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy  our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio in september 2008 we formed fund ii which serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquire additional investments in apartment communities until the earlier of august 2011 or until 90 of its committed capital is invested subject to certain exceptions as of december 31 2010 fund ii had acquired eight communities we may also from time to time engage in acquisitions andor dispositions of single communities or portfolios of multiple properties including by way of tax deferred likekind exchanges to adjust our investment allocation by geographic market and product type 

  

property management strategy  we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

 

 

 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which among others include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income “noi” produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

  

  

 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a wholly owned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy  we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1000000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and longterm liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

we established the funds to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary real estate investment funds we believe this investment format provides the following attractive attributes i this format provides third party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii the use of a discretionary investment fund structure provides additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds and iii this format provides visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

from its inception in 2005 until the investment period closed in march 2008 fund i was the exclusive vehicle through which we invested in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions in september 2008 we formed fund ii fund ii now serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we invest in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions until the earlier of august 2011 or until 90 of its committed capital is invested these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for fund ii fund ii does not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of ten years subject to two oneyear extensions fund ii has equity commitments from five institutional investors who with the company collectively committed 400000000 of which our commitment is 125000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the funds by investors have been or will be made through an entity that qualifies as a reit and in which we also own an equity interest as of january 31 2011 fund ii has made nine investments for a total of 571235000 invested as of january 31 2011 equity investors had contributed 233700000 of their committed capital to fund ii 

in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property we may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own 

 

  

  

 

other strategies and activities  while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2010 we had a total of 533489 square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under construction gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2010 was 8168000 09 of total revenue if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale at present through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a 50 partner in aria at hathorne llc we have an economic interest in the development of forsale town homes that have a total projected capital cost of 23621000 this forsale development is on a site that is adjacent to our avalon danvers community and that is zoned for forsale development any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 or the treasury regulations our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 “the code” as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

as we discussed in federal income tax considerations and consequences of your investment  expiration of certain reduced tax rate provisions of our prospectus supplement dated november 5 2010 several us federal income tax rates were scheduled to increase in taxable years beginning after december 31 2010 however under recently enacted legislation congress has temporarily extended the following rates for taxable years beginning before january 1 2013 1 the 15 maximum rate for longterm capital gains applicable to individuals trusts and estates 2 the 15 maximum rate for qualified dividend income applicable to individuals trusts and estates and 3 the 28 backup withholding rate

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

  

  

 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we project construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

  attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

 

  

  

 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt as well as effective variable interest rate debt achieved through the use of qualifying hedging relationships in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2010 approximately 623 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

 

  

  

 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na and wachovia bank na serving together as syndication agent and as banks bank of america na serving as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank morgan stanley bank wells fargo bank na and deutsche bank trust company americas serving collectively as documentation agent and as banks and a syndicate of other financial institutions serving as banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or other liquidity needs including the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

  

  

 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

subject to the requirements related to fund ii we may in the future acquire apartment communities on a select basis our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise as noted above we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments also as noted above in item 1 “business” through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a joint venture partner we have a 50 economic interest in a forsale development with a total estimated capital cost at completion of 23621000 on a site adjacent to one of our communities we may engage or have an interest in forsale activity in the future our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them or that we will be successful in other activities we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell 

  

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

  

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 communities  other land and real estate assets in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that the we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcels then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests   frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

  

  

 

risks associated with an investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds  

we formed fund i which through a wholly owned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and in which we have invested approximately 50000000 at december 31 2010 representing our total capital commitment for an equity interest of approximately 15 we have also formed fund ii which through a wholly owned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and to which we have committed 125000000 representing an equity interest of approximately 31 we have invested approximately 73031000 at december 31 2010 in fund ii these funds present risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 “communities – insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in new england the new york and new jersey metro area and the midwest we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

 

we are also aware that environmental agencies and third parties have in the case of certain properties with onsite or nearby contamination asserted claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties we currently do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of vapor intrusion at our communities 

 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

  

  

 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage our communities may also be affected by potential vapor intrusion risks resulting from subsurface soil or groundwater contamination by volatile organic compounds which may require investigation or remediation and could subject the company to liability 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

  

  

 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may engage in activities that are not customarily provided by a landlord through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director in a contested election if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast the incumbent directors would remain in office this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders’ best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

communities 

tableend our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 

 

 

 

development communities   are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received for the entire community these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

  

  

as of december 31 2010 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 

 

 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

current communities 

our current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings as of january 31 2011 our current communities consisted of 120 gardenstyle of which 15 are mixed communities andor include town homes 22 highrise and 31 midrise apartment communities 

our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features which may include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

other features at various communities may include 

 

 

 

 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

 

  

  

 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 

 

 

 

we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2010 we completed construction of 1547 apartment homes in four communities and sold 1007 apartment homes in three communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 16 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the average age of our current communities is 10 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2011 we owned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for the leases that expire in october 2026 november 2028 december 2034 and april 2095 we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in the 14 development communities all of which are currently consolidated for financial reporting purposes and one of which is subject to a land lease expiring in april 2106 

in our two partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2011 there were 15207 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

as of december 31 2010 we had 14 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 3334 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 879500000 you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of our 2011 outlook for development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2010 we had nine consolidated communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 113100000 excluding costs prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate continuing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

development rights 

at december 31 2010 we had 184150000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own and 77253000 in capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs related to development rights for which we control the land parcel typically through an option to purchase or lease the land collectively the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 26 development rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future the cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of december 31 2010 includes 143813000 in original land acquisition costs we also have 49979000 in future land acquisition costs under our commitment related to a development right in brooklyn ny as discussed under “offbalance sheet arrangements” elsewhere within this form 10k the original land acquisition cost per home including our obligation under the commitment ranged from 10000 per home in connecticut to 148000 per home in new york city in addition the land for a development right that we control under a 99year land lease agreement is subject to future minimum rental amounts of 6600000 per year the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 7313 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own 

for 18 development rights we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel while we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land for the eight remaining development rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery initial development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2010 we incurred a charge of approximately 2741000 of predevelopment cost for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed 

you should carefully review section 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

 

 

  

  

the table below presents a summary of these development rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2010 we acquired eight land parcels for development as shown in the table below for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 67494000 for seven of the eight parcels construction has either started or will start within the next 12 months 

 

 

other land and real estate assets 

we own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately 105218000 that we do not currently plan to develop these parcels consist of land that we i originally planned to develop and ii ancillary parcels acquired in connection with development rights that we had not planned to develop as more fully described below 

i the land that we originally acquired for future development has an original cost of 144702000 and a current carrying value of 83215000 and is comprised of nine parcels originally intended for the development of approximately 2700 apartment homes the current carrying value of these land parcels reflects impairment charges of 61487000 incurred in prior periods 

ii the out parcels and certain other land parcels that we acquired in connection with various development pursuits without a view to developing have a current carrying value of 22003000 which reflects impairment charges of 12166000 incurred in prior periods 

we believe that the current carrying value of 105218000 for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

  

  

recent disposition activity 

we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development activity on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2010 to january 31 2011 we sold our interest in three wholly owned communities   containing 1007 apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 190450000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a 100000000 limit each occurrence and in the aggregate in california the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 350000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional selfinsured retention until the total incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1400000 

on january 15 2011 we elected to extend our property insurance policy for a new 16 month term in order to take advantage of market conditions as a result our property insurance premium decreased by approximately 10 with no material changes in coverage we expect to renew this policy when it expires on may 15 2012 

in august 2010 we renewed our general liability policy and worker’s compensation coverage for a one year term and experienced an increase in the premium on these policies of approximately 3 which for the workers compensation coverage primarily reflects increased volume at a slightly lower rate and for the general liability coverage reflects a marginal rate increase for both policies there were no material changes in the coverage these policies are in effect until august 1 2011 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program until 2014 in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 250000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors – we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

 

 

  

  

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 5000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

as reported in our report on form 8k filed on october 20 2010 the company recently settled litigation with the us department of justice regarding the accessibility of the companys new york city buildings to persons with disabilities the company does not expect that the settlement and the companys fulfillment of its terms will have a material impact to its financial condition or results of operations additional details regarding this matter follow 

  

in august 2008 the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york on behalf of the united states filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court in that jurisdiction against the company the joint venture that owns its avalon chrystie place community and the architect that designed avalon chrystie place the lawsuit alleged that avalon chrystie place was not designed and constructed in accordance with the accessibility requirements of the federal fair housing act the company designed and constructed avalon chrystie place with a view to compliance with new york city’s local law 58 which is new york city’s code regulating accessible design and construction and has been viewed in new york city as a code that would also meet federal standards without admitting or denying liability the company the joint venture and the architect entered into a consent decree which the court approved on october 15 2010 the settlement requires that the company make various agreed upon modifications to the apartment homes and common areas at avalon chrystie place and inspect and to the extent necessary negotiate and make modifications at six other new york city communities owned by the company all retrofits are expected be capitalized as real estate improvements the consent decree contains other terms including a civil penalty and the establishment of an aggrieved persons fund to compensate individuals in the event they can establish that they were damaged by the alleged accessibility deficiencies at the company’s new york city communities amounts remaining in the aggrieved persons fund after its administration period will revert to the company the company has entered into a separate agreement with the architect of avalon chrystie place who also designed three of the company’s other new york city properties to share some of the cost of the civil penalty and aggrieved persons fund     we are from time to time subject to claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given we do not believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our operations

executive overview 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the midwest the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states our strategy is to be leaders in market research and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming submarkets of the united states our communities are predominately upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

financial highlights and outlook 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net income available to common stockholders was 175331000 compared to 155647000 for 2009 an increase of 126 the increase was due primarily to the loss on the redemption of unsecured notes and impairment loss recognized in 2009 with no comparable activity in 2010 

apartment fundamentals improved throughout 2010 driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product full year 2010 established communities noi decreased 28 from the prior year as a result of a decline in rental revenue from the prior year experienced in the first half of 2010 as well as increased operating expenses during 2010 the trends we experienced in 2009 with respect to revenue and noi growth improved throughout 2010 we experienced growth in established communities rental revenue over the prior year period for the second half of 2010 and our established communities noi increased 29 for the quarter ended december 31 2010 over the prior year period 

we expect earnings per share – diluted “eps” will increase to between 309 and 334 for 2011 from 207 in 2010 driven primarily by gains on disposition of real estate as well as continued improvements in revenue and noi from our established communities in 2011 this positive outlook reflects our expectations for i accelerated job growth ii the expected continued weakness in the forsale housing market during 2011 iii continued growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent and iv constrained levels of new supply our current financial outlook for 2011 provides for growth in rental revenue of between 40 and 55 in our established community portfolio resulting in a projected noi growth for our established communities of 60 to 75 

  

  

  

during 2010 we successfully raised or sourced capital totaling approximately 790000000 through sales of common equity in the public markets issuance of unsecured debt in public and private markets and asset sales we used the proceeds received to fund our development and redevelopment activities to acquire an indirect interest in assets through fund ii to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt and to repay floating rate debt while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of three communities and our former corporate office for a gross sales price of 198600000 

we expect to see continued strong investor demand for quality multifamily assets in 2011 due in part to the continued liquidity in the capital markets and continued constrained supply resulting from the decline in development activity in all markets we increased development activity during 2010 from the prior year in anticipation of the continued improvement in the economy and apartment fundamentals and believe that our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2010 we completed the development of four communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 566700000 which represents a savings from the original budgeted capitalized cost of 25000000 we started the development of 11 communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 643400000 during 2011 we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the market for a recovery in apartment fundamentals that we expect in 2011 and 2012 we anticipate new development starts in 2011 with a total projected capitalized cost of 800000000 to 900000000 consistent with this view we also expect to continue with our current level of redevelopment activity for our whollyowned communities in 2011 during which we expect to start redevelopment of six whollyowned communities 

during 2011 we expect to disburse between 600000000 and 800000000 related to the 14 communities under development at december 31 2010 the new development starts and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development we believe that our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2011 we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt andor common and preferred equity and secured debt as well as from disposition proceeds joint ventures or from retained cash 

we increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through development and acquisitions during 2011 we expect to be active in both acquisition and disposition activity for our whollyowned portfolio this activity pertains primarily to portfolio shaping and repositioning and is currently expected to have a nominal impact on our net capital position portfolio reshaping may also be accomplished through 1031 asset exchanges and we are actively pursuing such exchanges that do not materially impact our liquidity or geographic mix in addition to this activity and our growth through our core competency of developing whollyowned assets from capital sources we also expect to acquire interests in additional assets through our investment in fund ii 

we established fund i and fund ii to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i thirdparty joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio ii additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and potentially incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds and iii visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our whollyowned portfolio 

fund i is a discretionary real estate investment fund with nine institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and has invested approximately 50000000 in fund i representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund i was our principal   vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in march 2008 subsidiaries of fund i have 21 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of 434163000 with varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty ranging from october 2011 to september 2016 these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 

 

  

  

 

in the third quarter of 2010 a lender ran a competitive bid process to sell a 26000000 nonrecourse mortgage note secured by a fund i asset we participated in the bidding and purchased the note on an arms length basis for 24000000 the note pays interestonly through the maturity date of october 2014 at a stated interest rate of 606 subsequent to acquisition we modified certain terms of the mortgage note including i conforming the original principal balance to our purchase price ii modifying the interest payment terms to require remittance of interest based on available cash flow with any deficiency in the monthly payment amount accruing to the principal due on the note and iii modifying certain terms to help eliminate any potential conflicts between us and fund i such as removing any prepayment penalty at the date of acquisition and at december 31 2010 the fair value of the underlying collateral exceeded the note’s carrying balance 

fund ii is a discretionary real estate investment fund with six institutional investors including us one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and we have total equity commitments of 125000000 representing a 313 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund ii had invested 493135000 as of december 31 2010 fund ii has a term that expires in august 2018 plus two oneyear extension options fund ii now serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investment interests in apartment communities until august 2011 or if earlier until 90 of the committed capital of fund ii is invested subject to certain exceptions fund ii will not include or involve our development activities we receive in addition to any returns on our invested equity asset management fees property management fees and redevelopment fees we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met during the year ended december 31 2010 subsidiaries of fund ii acquired the following six operating communities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidiaries of fund ii have eight loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of 286899000 with varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty ranging from november 2014 to june 2019 these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 

in january 2011 a subsidiary of fund ii acquired waterstone carlsbad a gardenstyle community in carlsbad ca containing 448 apartment homes for a purchase price of 78100000 

as of january 31 2011 fund ii had uncalled capital commitments of 166300000 of which 51970000 was our portion 

  

  

communities overview 

as of december 31 2010 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 186 apartment communities containing 54579 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which 14 communities were under construction and nine communities were under reconstruction of these communities 30 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including 18 owned by subsidiaries of fund i and eight owned by subsidiaries of fund ii in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 26 wholly owned communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 7313 apartment homes 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities development communities and development rights our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2010 2009 and 2008 follows dollars in thousands 

 

  

  

 

 

 

net income attributable to common stockholders increased 19684000 or 126 to 175331000 in 2010 primarily due to the loss recognized on the early repurchase of debt completed in october 2009 and impairment losses recognized in 2009 with no comparable activity in 2010 net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 245386000 or 612 in 2009 from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in gains from the sale of communities 

noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 

  

  

 

 

 

the noi increases for both 2010 and 2009 as compared to the prior year period consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the noi decrease in established communities in 2010 is due to the rental revenue declines as a result of the job losses experienced in 2008 and 2009 coupled with increases in community operating expenses during 2010 we experienced sequential increases in rental rates while maintaining occupancy of at least 94 in all regions 

we anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will increase in 2011 such that overall established communities rental revenue will increase between 40 and 55 the projected revenue increase is due to our expectation of a continued economic recovery coupled with favorable apartment market fundamentals expense growth also impacts growth in noi and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth we expect operating expenses to increase in 2011 over 2010 between 00 and 20 as a result we expect noi for our established communities to increase between 60 and 75 these projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in 2011 both nationally and in the markets where we operate the individual demandsupply characteristics of each submarket in which we operate and assessment of each community’s potential performance for the upcoming year there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions andor their impact on our operating results will be accurate and actual results could differ materially please see risk factors forwardlooking statements and other discussions in this report on form 10k for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations 

rental and other income increased in both 2010 and 2009 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed communities offset somewhat by decreased rental income from our established communities 

 

overall portfolio – the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 40489 apartment homes for 2010 as compared to 38233 homes for 2009 and 37886 homes for 2008 the increase in 2010 over 2009 is due to homes available from newly developed communities offset partially by communities sold during 2010 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to 1823 for 2010 as compared to 1910 in 2009 and 1921 in 2008 

 

  

  

 

established communities – rental revenue decreased 6137000 or 09 for 2010 and 11014000 or 17 for 2009 the decrease in 2010 from 2009 is due primarily to lower rental rates for 2010 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased 13 to 1836 compared to 1861 in 2009 there was an increase in yearoveryear average economic occupancy for 2010 of 04  to 960 compared to 956 in 2009 the decrease in rental revenue in 2009 from the prior year is due to a combination of lower rental rates and decreased occupancy economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in rental revenue for our established community eastern regions and decreases in established communities’ rental revenue in our three west coast regions for 2010 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region which accounted for approximately 28 of established community rental revenue for 2010 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 02 for fullyear 2010 as compared to fullyear 2009 average rental rates decreased 01 to 2272 but economic occupancy increased 03 to 962 during 2010 as compared to 2009 during 2010 the improving economy and moderate job growth in both new york city and surrounding suburban markets supported the return to positive results in 2010 over the prior year we expect apartment market conditions to continue to improve at a moderate pace in 2011 with the strength of the recovery dependent largely on job and income growth in the regions large financial services industry 

the new england region accounted for approximately 22 of the established community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 08 over the prior year average rental rates decreased 01 to 1930 and economic occupancy increased 09 to 962 for 2010 as compared to 2009 reduced competition from a weak housing market and a lower volume of new multifamily supply has contributed to the improvement in apartment market conditions job growth in the boston area has been broadbased but with southwest connecticut lagging given greater dependence on the financial service and manufacturing sectors 

the midatlanticmidwest region which represented approximately 19 of established community rental revenue during 2010 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 10 as compared to 2009 average rental rates increased by 15 to 1753 while economic occupancy decreased by 05 from 965 to 960 for 2010 as compared to 2009 this region continues to benefit from the impact of government and government services employment which has served to stabilize the economy relative to other regions 

northern california accounted for approximately 18 of the established community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 38 from the prior year average rental rates decreased 41 to 1724 offset partially by an increase in economic occupancy of 03 to 961 for 2010 as compared to 2009 the regions large hightech sector is generating positive job growth while job growth in financial services and construction remains weak the recovery in apartment market conditions in northern california and other west coast regions is lagging the recovery experienced to date in east coast regions we expect fundamentals will improve in 2011 driven by an improving economy 

southern california accounted for approximately 9 of the established community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 36 from the prior year average rental rates decreased 48 to 1487 offset by an increase in economic occupancy of 12 to 953 for 2010 as compared to 2009 apartment market conditions remain weak given a slow economic recovery in the region however we expect conditions to improve in 2011 particularly in orange county as job growth resumes in line with a strengthening us economy 

the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately 4 of the established community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 65 from the prior year average rental rates decreased 72 to 1190 offset partially by an increase in economic occupancy of 07 to 949 for 2010 as compared to 2009 job growth in the region is broadbased driven by improvement in both aerospace and hightech however apartment fundamentals in the region remain challenging due to a large amount of new rental supply in several submarkets 

  

  

 

management development and other fees increased 26000 or 04 in 2010 and increased 760000 or 116 in 2009 the increase in 2009 was due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from fund ii 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 12006000 or 56 in 2010 and increased 22864000 or 120 for 2009 as compared to the prior year periods primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes in addition 2009 increased over the prior year due to increased bad debt expense resulting from the recession 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 2282000 or 14 to 160342000 for 2010 and 7746000 or 52 to 158060000 for 2009 the increase in 2010 over 2009 is due primarily to increased community maintenance related costs impacted by the severe weather in the quarter ended december 31 2009 and march 31 2010 offset partially by a decrease in administrative and insurance related expenses the decreases in administrative expense are primarily due to decreased bad debt the increase in 2009 over 2008 was due primarily to increased administrative and community maintenance related costs offset partially by a decrease in insurance and utility related expenses the increases in administrative expense were primarily due to increased bad debt 

 

property taxes increased 9686000 or 116 and 9863000 or 134 in 2010 and 2009 respectively due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 

for established communities property taxes increased by 3455000 or 52 and 3531000 or 56 for 2010 and 2009 respectively over the prior year due to both higher assessments throughout all regions as well as the size and timing of successful appeals the impact of the challenging economic environment experienced during 2008 and 2009 is only partially reflected in current assessments as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments however tax rates have continued to increase despite downward adjustments in assessed values we expect property taxes in 2011 to continue to increase over 2010 due primarily to higher tax rates for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased by 272000 or 07 in 2010 and decreased 2315000 or 58 in 2009 over the prior years the decrease in 2009 from 2008 is due primarily to decreases in compensation costs coupled with a reduction in costs associated with the initial start up of our customer care center the customer care center in virginia beach virginia opened in 2007 and expanded in 2008 to centralize certain communityrelated accounting administrative and customer service functions 

investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions and investment management investments and investment management costs decreased in 2010 by 20000 or 05 from the prior year investments and investment management costs decreased in 2009 by 943000 or 197 from 2008 due primarily to lower compensation and travelrelated costs 

expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits expensed development and other pursuit costs decreased in 2010 and 2009 from the prior years due to decreases in abandoned development pursuits attributable to continued economic improvement these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period 

  

  

  

 

interest expense net increased 24886000 or 166 and 35413000 or 308 in 2010 and 2009 respectively over the prior years this category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized and interest income the increases in 2010 and 2009 are due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized in each of the respective years as compared to the prior year coupled with increased interest expense in 2010 and 2009 compared to the prior years from additional secured and unsecured debt issued the decrease in interest capitalized is due to the reduction in development activity in 2010 and 2009 as compared to the prior years 

gain loss on the extinguishment of debt net reflects the impact of our debt repurchase activity for payments above or below the carrying basis the net loss in 2009 is due to the 310100000 in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium offset by the gain recognized from our january 2009 tender offer we did not recognize any gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt in 2010 

depreciation expens e increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities offset by assets sold during the years 

general and administrative expense “ga” decreased 1902000 or 66 in 2010 and decreased 14033000 or 328 in 2009 as compared to the prior years the decrease in 2010 and 2009 as compared to the prior year is due primarily to decreases in compensation related expenses the decrease in 2009 from the prior year is due primarily to higher severance and related costs in 2008 associated with the decrease in our planned development activity higher federal excise tax expense in 2008 resulting from gains on disposition activity and organization costs for the formation of fund ii incurred in 2008 

impairment loss for 2009 and 2008 was due to the write down of eleven land parcels which we concluded that we did not plan to develop at the time of impairment we did not recognize an impairment loss in 2010 

gain on sale of land decreased in 2010 and increased in 2009 as compared to the prior years due to the sale of two land parcels in 2009 without comparable activity in 2010 or 2008 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased 679000 or 471 in 2010 and 3125000 or 684 in 2009 from the prior years the decrease in 2010 is due to acquisition costs from fund ii which were not significant in 2009 or present in 2008 the decrease in 2009 is due primarily to the recognition of our proportionate amount of an impairment loss that one of our unconsolidated investments recognized on one of its operating communities in 2009 in addition gains from both the sale of a community by an unconsolidated joint venture as well as from an investment in a joint venture formed to develop for sale homes occurred in 2008 that were not present in 2009 these amounts were partially offset by the recognition of our promoted interest in the joint venture that owns avalon chrystie place in 2009 

income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2008 through december 31 2010 this income decreased for 2010 and 2009 due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period see note 7 “real estate disposition activities” of our consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of communities increased in 2010 and decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior years as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010 resulted in income to us for the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of 1252000 compared to income of 1373000 in 2009 and income of 741000 in 2008 the increase in income in 2009 relative to 2010 and 2008 is due primarily to reimbursement to us in 2009 for our joint venture partners’ portion of expenses incurred by fund ii the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2008 and 2009 also contributed to the increase in 2009 over 2008 thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 

  

  

 

ffo 

ffo is considered by management and the industry to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance in calculating ffo we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

we continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended december 31 2010 raising approximately 589000000 in the form of public equity and unsecured debt in 2011 we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including cash balances on hand and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below as well as our operating activities our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects at december 31 2010 we have unrestricted cash cash equivalents and cash in escrow of 479769000 available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities of which 93440000 relates to a development right for which we have not begun construction 

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 306426000 at december 31 2010 an increase of 200735000 from 105691000 at december 31 2009 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities – net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 332106000 in 2010 from 378600000 in 2009 the decrease was driven primarily by the timing of general corporate expenditures in 2010 as compared to 2009 

  

  

 

investing activities – net cash used in investing activities of 298936000 in 2010 related to investments in assets through development and redevelopment in total we invested 447045000 during 2010 in the following areas 

 

 

these amounts are partially offset by the proceeds from the disposition of real estate of 194009000 

financing activities – net cash provided by financing activities totaled 167565000 in 2010 the net cash provided is due primarily to the issuance of common shares primarily through the two continuous equity programs that we initiated in august 2009 and november 2010 for aggregate net proceeds of 381365000 and issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of 250000000 offset by the payment of cash dividends in the amount of 298090000 and repayment of unsecured notes at maturity of 89576000 and the repayment of secured notes of 69327000 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we currently have a 1000000000 revolving variable rate credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in november 2011 we pay an annual facility fee of approximately 1250000 the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 040 per annum 066 on january 31 2011 the spread over libor can vary from libor plus 0325 to libor plus 100 based on our credit rating in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 650000000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow at january 31 2011 there were no amounts outstanding on the credit facility 52923000 was used to provide letters of credit and 947077000 was available for borrowing under the credit facility 

we expect to refinance the credit facility prior to maturity in november 2011 the market for bank credit has changed materially since our existing facility was established in 2006 we expect the cost of the new facility will increase as compared to our current credit facility while market conditions likely support an ability to retain our current capacity a reduction in capacity may be appropriate to avoid increased costs to maintain that capacity 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the financial covenants include the following 

 

 

 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2010 

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity we believe that these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering programs 

in august 2009 we commenced our first continuous equity program “cep i” under which we were authorized to sell up to 400000000 of our common stock until august 2012 during the nine months ended september 30 2010 we completed the sale of common stock authorized under cep i during 2010 we sold 3080204 shares for an average sales price of 9588 and net proceeds of 290884000 from inception of cep i in august 2009 through completion of the offering in the third quarter of 2010 we sold a total of 4585105 shares at an average sales price of 8724 for net proceeds of 393993000 

  

  

 

in november 2010 we commenced our second continuous equity program “cep ii” under which we may sell up to 500000000 of our common stock from time to time during a 36month period actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with cep ii we engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold during the three months ended december 31 2010 we sold 432832 shares under cep ii at an average sales price of 11244 per share for net proceeds of 47935000 in january 2011 we issued an additional 177837 shares at an average price of 11115 per share for net proceeds of 19470000 

future financing and capital needs – debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in 2008 and 2009 if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our credit facility or by equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

in addition to the proceeds received under cep i and cep ii discussed above the following financing activity occurred during 2010 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2010 dollars in thousands 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

future financing and capital needs – portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2010 we had 14 new whollyowned communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 466991000 remained to be invested we also had nine wholly owned communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 73518000 remained to be invested in addition we may be required to contribute our proportionate share of capital to fund ii if or to the extent that fund ii makes capital calls in conjunction with additional community acquisitions during 2011 substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction development costs related to pursuing development rights as well as for equity contributions to fund ii will be funded from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the funds or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi   however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

 

  

  

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 

 

in addition as part of the formation of fund i we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee the guarantee provides that if upon final liquidation of fund i the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of fund i whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall but in no event more than 10 of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately 7500000 as of december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by fund i is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected fund i liquidation scenario the estimated fair value of and our obligation under this guarantee both at inception and as of december 31 2010 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december 31 2010 

 

in addition as part of the formation of fund ii we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee the guarantee provides that if upon final liquidation of fund ii the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of fund ii whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall but in no event more than 10 of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately 5842500 as of december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by fund ii is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected fund ii liquidation scenario the estimated fair value of and our obligation under this guarantee both at inception and as of december 31 2010 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december 31 2010 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are no other lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 

contractual obligations 

there have not been any material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2010 scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2010 dollars in thousands 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and basis of presentation” of our consolidated financial statements 

 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

 

  

  

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2010 our assets would have increased by 1360241000 and our liabilities would have increased by 990766000 we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any project specific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2010 our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our operating expenses would have increased by 2148000 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2010 would have decreased by 7725000 

  

  

  

 

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and the availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development by us no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits in the amounts of 2741000 in 2010 and 5842000 in 2009 these costs are included in operating expenses excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

we did not recognize any charges for impairment during 2010 during 2009 and 2008 we concluded that the economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning this resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of 21152000 and 57899000 respectively related to the impairment of 11 land parcels which we concluded we no longer intended to develop at that time we used both internal models and third party pricing estimates to determine the fair values of the land parcels considered to be impaired for assets zoned for multifamily residential use we used an internal model and used thirdparty pricing for all other assets both approaches incorporated significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore considered to be level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2010 our net income would have decreased by approximately 70100000 

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

 

  

  

 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes in the fourth quarter of 2009 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert fixed rate borrowings to effective floating rate notes in addition we have interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that serve to either convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings or effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

we had 821381000 and 984238000 in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements and including fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2010 and 2009 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 8682000 and 9951000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we had a 0 and 43435000 respectively of executed pay fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge cash flow variability for our variable rate taxexempt debt in addition we had executed receive fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge fair value exposure for approximately 225000000 and 300000000 of our fixed rate unsecured notes as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively had the receive fixed interest rate swap agreements used to hedge fair value exposure not been in place during 2010 and 2009 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 2121000 and 419000 higher respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years additionally if the variable interest rates on hedged floating rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2010 and 2009 and the pay fixed swap agreements used to hedge cash flow variability had not been in place our interest costs would have been approximately 179000 higher and 441000 higher in 2010 and 2009 respectively for the period these swaps were outstanding 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 4068417000 at december 31 2010 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 4236216000 at december 31 2010 contractual fixed rate debt excluding fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements represented 3247036000 of the carrying value and 3449226000 of the fair value at december 31 2010 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2010 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately 166051000

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust “reit” for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states these barriers to entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the washington dc metro area the midwest the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states we focus on these markets because we believe that over the longterm a limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in higher growth in cash flows relative to other markets 

at january 31 2010 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value through the development acquisition operation and when appropriate disposition of apartments in our markets to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire an interest in apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets with growing or high potential for demand and 

  high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to costeffective capital our timetested strategy is to be leaders in customer insight market research and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming us submarkets a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

during the three years ended december 31 2009 excluding activity for the funds as defined below we acquired one apartment community this community’s financial results are consolidated for financial reporting purposes during the same threeyear period excluding dispositions in which we retained an ownership interest we disposed of 19 apartment communities disposed of one investment in a real estate joint venture and completed the development of 30 apartment communities and the redevelopment of 10 apartment communities 

during this period we also realized gains from the sale of a community owned by avalonbay value added fund lp “fund i” an institutional discretionary investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 152 interest fund i acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance from its inception in march 2005 through the close of its investment period in march 2008 fund i acquired 20 communities fund i sold one community in 2008 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp “fund ii” an additional institutional discretionary investment fund which we manage and in which we currently own a 313 interest after adding additional equity commitments in the second quarter of 2009 a total of five institutional investors and the company collectively committed 400000000 of which our commitment is 125000000 during 2009 fund ii acquired two communities a more detailed description of fund i and fund ii collectively the “funds” and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion under item i “business — general — financing strategy” and note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

during 2009 we sold seven real estate assets resulting in a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of 65946000 

a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

  development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we will be moving our principal executive office to arlington virginia by june 2010 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning for further discussion of our development rights refer to item 2 “communities” in this report 

we generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a wholly owned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

during periods where competition for development land is more intense we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use during the period that we hold these buildings for future development the net revenue from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have established a dedicated group 

  of associates and procedures to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phases 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a community we solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio in september 2008 we formed fund ii which serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquire additional investments in apartment communities until the earlier of september 2011 or until 90 of its committed capital is invested subject to limited exceptions as of december 31 2009 fund ii had acquired two communities 

property management strategy  we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

 

 

 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include the following among others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income “noi” produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

  we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a wholly owned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” and is therefore subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy we maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks we estimate that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand borrowings under our 1000000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” sales of current operating communities andor issuance of additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and longterm liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

from its inception in 2005 until the investment period closed in march 2008 fund i was the exclusive vehicle through which we invested in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions in september 2008 we formed fund ii fund ii now serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we invest in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions until the earlier of september 2011 or until 90 of its committed capital is invested these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for fund ii fund ii does not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of ten years subject to two oneyear extensions fund ii has equity commitments from five institutional investors who with the company collectively committed 400000000 of which our commitment is 125000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the funds by investors have been or will be made through an entity that qualifies or that will qualify as a reit and in which we also own an equity interest as of january 31 2010 fund ii has made two investments for a total of 104330000 invested in february 2010 fund ii purchased its third community for a purchase price of 31250000 

in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property 

other strategies and activities  while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit in addition we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2009 we had a 

  total of 456260 square feet of rentable retail space excluding retail space within communities currently under construction gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in 2009 was 8915000 10 of total revenue if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale at present through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a 50 partner in aria at hathorne llc we have an economic interest in the development of forsale town homes that have a total projected capital cost of 23621000 this forsale development is on a site that is adjacent to our avalon danvers community and that is zoned for forsale development any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code or the treasury regulations our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 “the code” as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe that more government regulation of energy use along with a greater focus on environmental protection may over time have a significant impact on urban growth patterns if changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in highdensity development however there can be no assurance as to whether or 

  when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or if they do occur whether the multifamily industry or the company will benefit from such changes

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we project construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and investments in the funds 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlordtenant laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

  attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our credit facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur contractual variable interest rate debt as well as effective variable interest rate debt achieved through the use of qualifying hedging relationships in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2009 approximately 68 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents and in consequence can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na and wachovia bank na serving together as syndication agent and as banks bank of america na serving as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank morgan stanley bank wells fargo bank na and deutsche bank trust company americas serving collectively as documentation agent and as banks and a syndicate of other financial institutions serving as banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt our credit facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or other liquidity needs including the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual 

  distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends  

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

subject to the requirements related to fund ii we may in the future acquire apartment communities on a select basis our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise as noted above we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments also as noted above in item 1 “business” through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a joint venture partner we have a 50 economic interest in a forsale development with a total estimated capital cost at completion of 23621000 on a site adjacent to one of our communities we may engage or have an interest in forsale activity in the future our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them or that we will be successful in other activities we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and 

  lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell 

land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges 

we own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop as discussed in item 2 “communities — other land and real estate assets” in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that the we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcel’s then current fair value less costs to dispose we would be subject to an impairment charge which would reduce our net income 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer joint venture investments including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with an investment in and management of discretionary investment funds  

we formed fund i which through a wholly owned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and in which we have invested approximately 50000000 at december 31 2009 representing our total capital commitment for an equity interest of approximately 15 we have also formed fund ii which through a wholly owned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and to which we have committed 125000000 representing a current equity interest of approximately 31 we have invested approximately 17500000 at december 31 2009 in fund ii these funds present risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 “communities — insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

  a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in new england and the midwest we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

  all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage our communities may also be affected by potential vapor intrusion risks resulting from subsurface soil or groundwater contamination by volatile organic compounds which may require investigation or remediation and could subject the company to liability 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to 

  our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may engage in activities that are not customarily provided by a landlord through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification andor to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a reit these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director in a contested election if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast the incumbent directors would remain in office this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders’ best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 

development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received for the entire community these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

  in addition we own approximately 60000 square feet of office space in alexandria virginia for our corporate office with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases in the third quarter of 2009 we entered into a tenyear operating lease for approximately 50744 square feet of office space in arlington virginia which will serve as the location for our corporate office by the end of the second quarter 2010 we are exploring alternatives to lease or sell the office space in alexandria virginia 

as of december 31 2009 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

current communities 

our current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings as of january 31 2010 these include 113 gardenstyle of which 15 are mixed communities andor include town homes 22 highrise and 29 midrise apartment communities 

our communities offer a variety of quality amenities and features including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other features at various communities may include 

   

 

 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a serviceoriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe our mission of enhancing the lives of our residents helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 

 

we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2009 we completed construction of 2526 apartment homes in nine communities and sold 1037 apartment homes in five communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 143 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the average age of our current communities is 92 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2010 we own 

 

 

 

 

   

 

for some communities a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration we have options to purchase the underlying land for the leases that expire in october 2026 november 2028 july 2029 december 2034 april 2095 and march 2142 we also hold directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in the seven development communities all of which are currently consolidated for financial reporting purposes and two of which are subject to land leases expiring in may 2105 and april 2106 

in our two partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2010 there were 15351 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

  development communities 

as of december 31 2009 we had seven development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 2438 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 813300000 you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of our 2010 outlook for development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 

 

 

 redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2009 we had seven consolidated communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 118400000 excluding costs prior to redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to communities owned by the funds as well as communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

  the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 

 

 

 development rights 

as of december 31 2009 we are evaluating the future development of 28 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land although for 14 of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 7180 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2009 there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 87763000 relating to development rights in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 237095000 are reflected as land held for development as of december 31 2009 on the consolidated balance sheet of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report in addition we control certain land that is held for development under a 99year land lease agreement with future minimum obligations of approximately 6500000 per year 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery initial development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2009 we incurred a charge of approximately 5842000 of predevelopment cost for development rights that were not yet probable of future development at the 

  time incurred or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed we also incurred a charge of 21152000 on three land parcels that were held for development that we do not currently intend to develop 

you should carefully review section 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the table below presents a summary of these development rights 

 

 

 29 

  land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2009 we acquired the following two land parcels for development for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 11951000 

 

 

 other land and real estate assets 

at december 31 2009 we own land that we do not currently intend to develop with an aggregate carrying basis under gaap of 96356000 we believe that the current carrying basis of these assets is such that there is no charge for impairment or further charge in the case of assets previously impaired however we may be subject to the recognition of further impairment charges in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying basis of the assets is greater than the current fair value less costs to dispose 

recent disposition activity 

we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2009 to january 31 2010 we sold our interest in six wholly owned communities containing 1332 apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price for these assets was 225125000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than 

  insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california and washington for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage earthquake coverage outside of california and washington is subject to a 100000000 limit each occurrence and in the aggregate in california the deductible each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 350000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional selfinsured retention until the total incurred selfinsured retention exceeds 1400000 

on december 31 2009 we elected to cancel and rewrite our property insurance policy for a 16 month term in order to take advantage of updated earthquake loss projections and declining insurance premium rates as a result our property insurance premium decreased by approximately 24 with no material changes in coverage we expect to renew this policy when it expires on may 1 2011 

in august 2009 we renewed our general liability policy and worker’s compensation coverage for a one year term and experienced a decrease in the premium on these policies of approximately 25 with no material changes in the coverage these policies are in effect until august 1 2010 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program until 2014 in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 250000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors — we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 5000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously reported we are involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act “fha” and the americans with disabilities act the equal rights center “erc” filed a complaint against us on september 23 2005 in the us district court district of maryland with respect to 100 properties in november 2009 we settled this litigation by entering into a court approved consent decree under the consent decree we will inspect and if necessary remediate up to 8250 apartment units and related public and common areas at our communities we expect that the remediation resulting from the inspections which should occur over approximately a four year period will enhance andor extend the useful life of the applicable communities and will therefore be capitalized although we will not be able to determine the exact remediation or associated costs until inspections are completed we do not believe that the remediation costs will be material to the company 

  on august 13 2008 the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york filed a civil lawsuit against the company and the joint venture cvp i llc in which it has an interest that owns avalon chrystie place the lawsuit alleges that avalon chrystie place was not designed and constructed in accordance with the accessibility requirements of the fha the company designed and constructed avalon chrystie place with a view to compliance with new york city’s local law 58 which for more than 20 years has been new york city’s code regulating the accessible design and construction of apartments after the filing of its answer and affirmative defenses during the fourth quarter of 2009 the plaintiff served the company with discovery requests relating to communities owned by the company nationwide the company objected to these discovery requests as being overly broad as the plaintiff’s complaint made factual allegations with regard to avalon chrystie place only a magistrate judge agreed with the company and limited discovery to avalon chrystie place the plaintiff is appealing the magistrate judge’s ruling due to the preliminary nature of the department of justice matter including whether the scope of their suit will be extended to other properties we cannot predict or determine the outcome of that matter nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss if any that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement 

on august 1 2008 we filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of washington in the county of king  avalon downreit v lp v grandglacier llc et al relating to our assertion that the homeowners association in which our former avalon wynhaven community is a part systematically overcharged us for various shared costs we sold this property in 2008 and agreed to indemnify the buyer for annual association fees to the extent they exceed an amount that we each agreed was reasonable the defendants have filed a crossclaim against avalon downreit v lp seeking foreclosure of the property and satisfaction of all amounts alleged to be due we intend to vigorously pursue our claim and defend against the counter claim we are negotiating a settlement of this litigation on terms that are not material to the company’s operations or financial condition but we cannot predict if or when we will settle this litigation or the terms of a final judgment or settlement 

in addition to the matters described above we are involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given we do not believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our operations

executive overview 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the midwest the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states our timetested strategy is to be leaders in customer insight market research and capital allocation delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the bestperforming us submarkets our communities are predominately upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

financial highlights and outlook 

for the year ended december 31 2009 net income available to common stockholders was 155647000 compared to 401033000 for 2008 a decrease of 612 the decrease is primarily due to the reduced number of communities sold and amount of gains related to these sales in 2009 as compared to the prior year coupled with the loss recognized on the tender offer completed in october 2009 offset somewhat by a decrease in charges for land impairments and abandoned pursuit costs detail of the impacts for the land impairments abandoned pursuits as well as the charge for the tender offer and certain other nonroutine items is provided in the following table 

  nonroutine items decrease increase in net income and ffo dollars in thousands 

 

 

 apartment fundamentals continued to be challenged during 2009 job losses exceeded our expectations during the year resulting in more than expected downward pressure on rental revenue our established community portfolio experienced a decline in yearoveryear rental revenue of 37 comprised of a decrease in rental rates of 31 and in economic occupancy of 06 this decrease in revenues and an increase in operating expenses resulted in a decline in our established community portfolio noi of 71 in 2009 from the prior year 

we expect earnings per share — diluted “eps” will decrease to 173 for 2010 from 193 in 2009 driven primarily by a decline in revenue and noi from our established communities in 2010 as compared to the prior year the recession coupled with the short term nature of apartment leases continues to adversely impact current operating fundamentals the expected decline in our 2010 noi is attributable largely to the effect of job losses experienced during the past two years employment is a leading demand driver and we expect continued weak employment conditions to contribute to revenue declines in 2010 the impact of job losses on our results for 2010 may be somewhat offset by i the expected continued weakness in the forsale housing market during 2010 ii growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent and iii constrained levels of new supply our current financial outlook for 2010 provides for a decline in rental revenue of between 30 and 45 in our established community portfolio resulting in a projected noi decline for our established communities of 50 to 70 

we were again active in the capital markets in 2009 raising in excess of 1700000000 through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt assets sales sales of common equity in the public markets and capital commitments for fund ii we have used the proceeds received to fund our development and redevelopment activities to acquire an indirect interest in assets through fund ii to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt and to repay floating rate debt while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes our focus on raising capital includes consideration for managing the maturity risk associated with our secured and unsecured debt obligations our 2009 activity includes the issuance of over 800000000 of secured financing and 500000000 of unsecured notes in september 2009 in two 250000000 tranches one maturing in 2017 and the second maturing in 2020 a portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase 310100000 principal amount of some or all of the amounts outstanding on unsecured notes maturing over the next three years effectively extending the duration of debt maturities while reducing interest costs we believe that our relatively modest level of secured and unsecured debt will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 

  the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of five communities for a gross sales price of 179675000 we anticipate our level of disposition activity will be consistent in 2010 within the range of gross sales of 180000000 to 200000000 occurring primarily during the first half of the year 

during 2009 we completed the development of nine communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 810700000 we started the development of two communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 64900000 

we expect an increase in investor demand for quality multifamily assets due in part to the increased liquidity in the capital markets and constrained supply resulting from the decline in development activity in all markets while we reduced our level of development during 2009 in response to the general deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions we believe that our development activity will continue to create longterm value during 2010 we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the market for a recovery in apartment fundamentals that we expect in 2011 and 2012 we anticipate new development starts in 2010 with a total projected capitalized cost of 380000000 consistent with this view we also expect to increase redevelopment activity for our wholly owned communities in 2010 during which we expect to start redevelopment of seven wholly owned communities 

during 2010 we expect to disburse approximately 500000000 related to the seven communities under development at december 31 2009 the new development starts and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development we expect approximately 50000000 of the projected 2010 disbursements will be funded from cash in escrow related to previously sourced taxexempt debt we believe that our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2010 we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt andor common and preferred equity and secured debt as well as from disposition proceeds joint ventures or from retained cash we believe that the current market provides for an opportunity to perform certain scheduled maintenance and repositioning activities at attractive costs due to a continued decline in costs for construction materials and labor 

we increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through development and acquisitions while we grow principally through our demonstrated core competency of developing wholly owned assets from capital sources we also acquire interests in additional assets primarily through our investment in fund ii 

fund i is a discretionary investment fund with nine institutional investors including us one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and has invested approximately 50000000 in fund i representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in march 2008 subsidiaries of fund i have 21 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of 436410000 with varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty ranging from october 2011 to september 2016 these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 

fund ii is a second discretionary investment fund with six institutional investors including us one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii fund ii was formed in august 2008 and in the second quarter of 2009 we added equity commitments for fund ii resulting in total equity commitments from five institutional investors and us of 400000000 of which our commitment is 125000000 total equity commitments to fund ii in the second quarter of 2009 increased by 67000000 as a result of the following 

 

   

fund ii can employ leverage of up to 65 allowing for a total investment capacity of approximately 1100000000 and has a term that expires in august 2018 plus two oneyear extension options fund ii now serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investment interests in apartment communities until august 2011 or if earlier until 90 of the committed capital of fund ii is invested subject to limited exceptions fund ii will not include or involve our development activities we will receive in addition to any returns on invested equity asset management fees property management fees and redevelopment fees we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met 

in 2009 fund ii acquired two communities avalon bellevue park a 220 apartmenthome community located in bellevue washington and the hermitage a 491 apartmenthome community located in fairfax virginia fund ii has invested 104330000 as of december 31 2009 fund ii has one loan secured by an asset in the amount of 21515000 with a maturity of june 2019 this loan is payable by fund ii as of december 31 2009 fund ii also has 30200000 outstanding under a credit facility that matures in december 2010 

in february 2010 fund ii acquired its third community a 203 apartmenthome community located in gaithersburg maryland 

communities overview 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities development communities and development rights our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

as of december 31 2009 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 172 apartment communities containing 50364 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which seven communities were under construction and seven communities were under reconstruction of these communities 24 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including 19 owned by subsidiaries of fund i and two owned by subsidiaries of fund ii in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 28 wholly owned communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 7180 apartment homes 

results of operations 

  our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2009 2008 and 2007 follows dollars in thousands 

 

net income attributable to common stockholders decreased 245386000 or 612 to 155647000 in 2009 primarily due to the reduced number of communities sold and amount of gains related to these sales in 2009 as compared to the prior year and the loss recognized on the early repurchase of debt completed in october 2009 the overall decline in net income was mitigated by a reduction in charges for land impairments and abandoned pursuit costs between years net income attributable to common stockholders increased 51573000 or 148 in 2008 over the prior year period due primarily to gains from the sale of communities and yearoveryear increases in community operating performance partially offset by charges associated with land impairments and abandoned pursuits as well as increased costs for interest and depreciation 

noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 

   

the noi increases for both 2009 and 2008 as compared to the prior year period consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 

 

the noi decrease in established communities in 2009 is due to the rental revenue declines as a result of the job losses experienced in 2008 and 2009 coupled with increases in community operating expenses during 2009 we focused on minimizing rental rate declines while maintaining occupancy of at least 94 in all regions 

we anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will decline in 2010 such that overall rental revenue will decline between 30 and 45 the projected revenue decline is due to our expectation of continued job losses at least through the second quarter of 2010 expense growth also impacts growth in noi and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth we expect operating expenses to be flat in 2010 from prior year levels as a result we expect noi for our established communities to decline between 50 and 70 these projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in 2010 both nationally and in the markets where we operate as well as the individual demandsupply characteristics of each submarket in which we operate there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions andor their impact on our operating results will be accurate and actual results could differ materially please see “risk factors” “forwardlooking statements” and other discussions in this report on form 10k for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations 

rental and other income increased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due to additional rental income generated from newly developed communities offset somewhat by decreased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities rental and other income increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 

 

   

we experienced decreases in established communities’ rental revenue in all six of our regions for 2009 as compared to the prior year period as discussed in more detail below 

 

   

in accordance with gaap cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term which is generally one year as a supplemental measure we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions as well as current rental market conditions 

the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years 2009 and 2008 dollars in thousands information for the year ended december 31 2007 is not presented as established community classification is not comparable prior to january 1 2008 see note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

 

management development and other fees increased 760000 or 116 in 2009 and increased 426000 or 69 in 2008 the increase in 2009 was due primarily to increased asset and property management fees from fund ii the increase in 2008 was due primarily to increased redevelopment fees and property management fees as additional communities were acquired by subsidiaries of fund i 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 22817000 or 119 in 2009 and increased 19722000 or 115 for 2008 as compared to the prior year periods primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes coupled with increased administrative expense due primarily to increases in bad debt expense due to the recession 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 6411000 or 48 to 139955000 for 2009 and 328000 or 02 to 133544000 for 2008 due primarily to increased administrative and community maintenance related costs offset partially by a decrease in insurance and utility related expenses the increases in administrative expense are primarily due to increased bad debt 

property taxes increased 9872000 or 134 and 6697000 or 100 in 2009 and 2008 respectively due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 

for established communities property taxes increased by 1242000 or 21 and 3515000 or 62 for 2009 and 2008 respectively over the prior year due to both higher assessments throughout all regions and reductions in property taxes realized in 2008 that did not occur in 2009 the impact of the current economic environment has not been reflected in current assessments as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments we expect property taxes in 2010 to increase over 2009 due primarily to higher tax rates without the benefit of lower assessed values for communities in california property tax changes are determined by the change in the california consumer price index with increases limited by law proposition 13 we evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage thirdparty consultants to assist in our evaluations we appeal property tax increases when appropriate 

  corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased by 2315000 or 58 in 2009 and increased 1247000 or 32 in 2008 over the prior year periods the decrease in 2009 over 2008 is due primarily to decreases in compensation costs coupled with a reduction in costs associated with the initial start up of our customer care center discussed below the increase in 2008 over the prior year is due primarily to increased compensation and employee separation costs as well as costs relating to the initial start up of the customer care center and other corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities the customer care center in virginia beach virginia opened in 2007 and expanded in 2008 to centralize certain communityrelated accounting administrative and customer service functions 

investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions and investment management investments and investment management costs decreased in 2009 by 943000 or 197 from the prior year due primarily to lower compensation and travelrelated costs 

expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits expensed development and other pursuit costs increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2009 due to increases in abandoned development pursuits in response to the economic decline and deteriorating market conditions in 2008 these costs can be volatile particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs may vary significantly from period to period 

interest expense net increased 35413000 or 308 and 22735000 or 247 in 2009 and 2008 respectively over the prior years this category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized and interest income the increase in 2009 is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized in 2009 as compared to the prior year coupled with increased interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 from additional secured and unsecured debt issued to fund development activity the decrease in interest capitalized is due to the reduction in development activity in 2009 as compared to 2008 the increase in 2008 over the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in interest income in 2008 as compared to the prior year period coupled with increased interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007 the higher level of interest income in 2007 is due to higher invested cash balances from our january 2007 equity offering the increased interest expense in 2008 is due primarily to increased amounts of debt outstanding in 2008 compared to the prior year 

gain loss on the extinguishment of debt net reflects the impact of our debt repurchase activity for payments above or below the carrying basis the net loss in 2009 is due to the 310100000 in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium offset by the gain recognized from our january 2009 tender offer 

depreciation expens e increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities offset by assets sold during the year 

general and administrative expense “ga” decreased 14033000 or 328 in 2009 and increased 14287000 or 501 in 2008 as compared to the prior years the increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2009 is due primarily to higher severance and related costs in 2008 associated with the decrease in our planned development activity higher federal excise tax expense in 2008 resulting from gains on disposition activity and organization costs for the formation of fund ii incurred in 2008 

impairment loss for 2009 is due to the write down of three land parcels which we do not currently plan on developing impairment loss in 2008 is due primarily to the write down of eight land parcels which we did not plan on developing at the time we did not recognize an impairment loss in 2007 

gain on sale of land for 2009 increased primarily due to the sale of two land parcels in 2009 without comparable activity in the prior year 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities for 2009 decreased from the prior year period due primarily to the recognition of our proportionate amount of an impairment loss that one of our unconsolidated investments recognized on one of its operating communities in 2009 in addition gains from both the sale of a community by an 

  unconsolidated joint venture as well as from an investment in a joint venture formed to develop for sale homes occurred in 2008 that were not present in 2009 these amounts were partially offset by the recognition of our promoted interest in the joint venture that owns avalon chrystie place in 2009 the decrease in 2008 from the prior year is due primarily to the gain on the sale of two partnership interests in 2007 and the related loss of partnership income partially offset by our portion of the gain from the sale of a community by a joint venture partner income from joint ventures where the underlying communities have achieved stabilized operations and gains from our investment in a joint venture formed to develop forsale homes 

income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2007 through december 31 2009 this income decreased for 2009 and 2008 due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period see note 7 “real estate disposition activities” of our consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of communities decreased in 2009 and increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year periods as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 

net income loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for 2009 resulted in income of 1373000 compared to income of 741000 in 2008 due primarily to recognition of income for our joint venture partners’ portion of expenses incurred by fund ii as well as the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2008 and 2009 thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 

ffo 

ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance in calculating ffo we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 

  during 2009 we saw access to liquidity improve as credit and equity markets recovered during 2009 we raised in excess of 1700000000 in the form of secured debt unsecured debt and public and private equity in 2010 we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including cash balances on hand borrowing capacity under our credit facility as defined below secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below as well as our operating activities to the extent that currently available internal and external resources do not satisfy our needs we may seek additional external financing additional external financing could come from a variety of sources such as public sales of debt or equity securities or unsecured or secured loans from financial institutions or other private or governmental lenders among others private equity through joint ventures may also be used our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects at december 31 2009 we have unrestricted cash cash equivalents and cash in escrow of 316367000 available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities of which 93440000 relates to a development right for which we have not begun construction 

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 105691000 at december 31 2009 an increase of 40756000 from 64935000 at december 31 2008 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

 

 

 

 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we currently have a 1000000000 revolving variable rate credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in november 2011 assuming our exercise of a oneyear renewal option we pay an annual facility fee of approximately 1250000 the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 040 per annum 063 on january 31 2010 the spread over libor can vary from libor plus 0325 to libor plus 100 based on our credit rating in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 650000000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january 31 2010 at january 31 2010 there were no amounts outstanding on the credit facility 

  45355000 was used to provide letters of credit and 954645000 was available for borrowing under the credit facility we expect to refinance the credit facility prior to maturity while credit market conditions continue to improve from the difficult environment seen in 2008 and 2009 we expect facility pricing to be higher and we may not be able to achieve the same borrowing capacity as exists under the current credit facility 

we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the financial covenants include the following 

 

we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2009 

in addition our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance defeasance or prepayment penalty provisions which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 

continuous equity offering program 

in august 2009 we commenced the cep under which we may sell up to 400000000 of our common stock this program is available until the 400000000 is sold or august 2012 whichever occurs first we may sell the shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us including market conditions the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding in conjunction with the cep we engaged sales agents who received compensation of 15 of the gross sales price for shares sold during the three months ended december 31 2009 we sold 37900 shares under this program at an average sales price of 7434 per share for net proceeds of 2775000 during the year ended december 31 2009 we sold 1504901 shares under this program at an average sales price of approximately 6956 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately 103109000 

future financing and capital needs — debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in 2008 and 2009 if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our credit facility or by equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following financing activity occurred during 2009 

 

   

 

 

  the following table details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2009 dollars in thousands

   future financing and capital needs — portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2009 we had seven new wholly owned communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 245046000 remained to be invested we also had seven wholly owned communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 49527000 remained to be invested in addition we may be required to contribute our proportionate share of capital to fund ii if or to the extent that fund ii makes capital calls in conjunction with additional community acquisitions during 2010 substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction development costs related to pursuing development rights as well as for equity contributions to fund ii will be funded from 

 

before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the funds or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights write off associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying 

  degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 

   

there are no other lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 

contractual obligations 

in 2009 we entered into a lease agreement for office space in arlington virginia the office space will serve as our corporate headquarters with relocation scheduled to occur in the first half of 2010 the lease has a ten year lease term with extension rights with rent of approximately 1900000 annually we are marketing for lease or sale the building that serves as our current headquarters in alexandria virginia aside from this lease there have not been any other material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2009 

  scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2009 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed in addition these 

  forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements in addition to the factors referred to below you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this document for a discussion of additional risks associated with our business and these forwardlooking statements 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and basis of presentation” of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the applicable accounting guidance for investment interests that we do not consolidate we 

  evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2009 our assets would have increased by 1030260000 and our liabilities would have increased by 778156000 we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any project specific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2009 our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our operating expenses would have increased by 2493200 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if we had 

  determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2009 would have decreased by 8776300 

abandoned pursuit costs  asset impairment 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and the availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development by us no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits in the amounts of 5842000 in 2009 and 12511000 in 2008 these costs are included in operating expenses excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 

during 2009 we concluded that the continued economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning this resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of 20302000 related to the impairment of two land parcels which we currently do not intend to develop we looked to thirdparty pricing estimates to determine the fair values of the land parcels considered to be impaired given the heterogeneous nature of multifamily real estate the third party values incorporated significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore considered to be level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy in addition in 2009 we recognized a further impairment charge of 850000 on a land parcel for which an earlier impairment had been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 the additional impairment charge reduces our carrying basis to its current estimated selling price less costs to dispose 

our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate andor capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2009 our net income would have decreased by approximately 62000000 

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to reduce the 

  potentially adverse effect on our results of operations our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily in shortterm libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates in addition the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders and not for trading or speculative purposes in the fourth quarter of 2009 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert fixed rate borrowings to effective floating rate notes in addition we have interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that serve to either convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings or effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 

we had 1271273000 and 1088848000 in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements and including fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2009 and 2008 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 9079000 and 11490000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

as of december 31 2009 we had executed interest rate swap agreements to hedge cash flow variability for approximately 43435000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt and executed interest rate swap agreements to hedge fair value exposure for approximately 300000000 of our fixed rate unsecured notes had these interest rate swap agreements not been in place during 2009 and 2008 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 1492000 higher and 1451000 lower respectively based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years additionally if the variable interest rates on hedged floating rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2009 and 2008 and these swap agreements had not been in place our annual interest costs would have been approximately 2054000 higher and 887000 lower respectively 

because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 3977320000 at december 31 2009 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 4052817000 at december 31 2009 contractual fixed rate debt represented 3249647000 of the carrying value and 3352312000 of the fair value at december 31 2009 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2009 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by 159030000

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the midwest the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states we focus on these markets because we believe that over the long term a limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets 

at january 31 2009 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are meaningful other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that yearoveryear comparisons are not meaningful developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value through the development acquisition operation and ultimate disposition of apartments in our high barriertoentry markets to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the 

  proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such that we maintain continuous access to costeffective capital our longterm strategy is to more deeply penetrate the high barriertoentry markets in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

during the three years ended december 31 2008 excluding acquisitions for the fund as defined below we acquired two apartment communities and purchased our partner’s interest in a joint venture that owns an apartment community all three communities’ financial results are consolidated for financial reporting purposes during the same threeyear period excluding dispositions in which we retained an ownership interest we disposed of 18 apartment communities including a community held by a joint venture in which we held a 25 equity interest disposed of one investment in a real estate joint venture and completed the development of 27 apartment communities and the redevelopment of seven apartment communities including communities we redeveloped for the fund as defined below 

during this period we also realized gains from the sale of a community owned by avalonbay value added fund lp the “fund” an institutional discretionary investment fund which we manage and in which we own a 152 interest the fund acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance since its inception in march 2005 the fund has acquired 20 communities and sold one community in 2008 the investment period for the fund ended in march 2008 

in september 2008 we formed avalonbay value added fund ii lp “fund ii” an additional private discretionary investment vehicle which we manage and in which we currently own a 45 interest at final closing the aggregate investor commitments to fund ii and our commitment and percentage interest in fund ii may change fund ii will seek to create value through redevelopment enhanced operations andor improving market fundamentals of communities that it will acquire principally in our markets a more detailed description of the fund and fund ii and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion under item i “business — general — financing strategy” and note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

during 2008 we sold 11 assets including one fund asset resulting in a gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of 288384000 

as a result of the recent economic downturn and corresponding adverse impacts on employment and credit availability we decreased our construction volume during 2008 as measured by total projected capitalized cost at completion and reduced our planned development activity for 2009 we do not anticipate starting any new development during the first half of 2009 development starts in the second half of 2009 if any will be evaluated based on our assessment of economic real estate and capital market conditions at that time we do anticipate an increase in our redevelopment activity for both wholly owned assets and assets held by the fund 

for 2009 we anticipate asset sales in the range of 100000000 to 200000000 dependent on strategic and value realization opportunities the level of our disposition activity also depends on real estate and capital market conditions a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

  development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices administrative offices or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we have acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning we currently own land that is held for development with an aggregate carrying basis under gaap of 239456000 on which we have not yet commenced construction 

except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers when we start construction we act as our own general contractor and construction manager we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a wholly owned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

when there is increased competition for desirable development opportunities we will in some cases be engaged in more complicated developments for example at times we have acquired and may in the future acquire existing commercial buildings with the intent to pursue rezoning tenant terminations or expirations and demolition of the existing structures during the period that we hold these buildings for future development the net revenue from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have established a dedicated group of 

  associates and procedures to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phases 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities when we decide to sell a community we solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio in 2005 we formed the fund which until its investment period closed in march 2008 served as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquired additional investments in apartment communities subject to limited exceptions in september 2008 we formed fund ii which will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire additional investments in apartment communities until the earlier of september 2011 or until 90 of its committed capital is invested subject to limited exceptions as of december 31 2008 fund ii had made no investments 

property management strategy  we seek to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways which include the following among others 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize 

  revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a wholly owned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” and is therefore subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to maintain a capital structure that provides us with flexibility in meeting the financial obligations and opportunities presented by our real estate development and ownership business we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility and sales of current operating communities if required to meet the balance of our current or anticipated liquidity needs we will borrow funds under our existing unsecured credit facility sell existing communities or land andor issue additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and long term liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures or partnerships our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle is used investments in joint ventures or partnerships are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 

from its inception in 2005 until the investment period closed in march 2008 the fund was the exclusive vehicle through which we invested in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions in september 2008 we formed fund ii fund ii will now serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will invest in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions until the earlier of september 2011 or until 90 of its committed capital is invested these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for fund ii fund ii does not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of ten years subject to two oneyear extensions fund ii has four institutional investors including us with a combined equity capital commitment of 333000000 a significant portion of the investments made in fund ii by its investors are being made through 

  avalonbay value added reit ii lp a delaware limited partnership that intends to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the “fund ii reit” a wholly owned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of fund ii and has committed 150000000 to fund ii and the fund ii reit none of which has been invested as of january 31 2009 representing a 45 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest at final closing the aggregate investor commitments to fund ii and our commitment and percentage interest in fund ii may change as of january 31 2009 fund ii has made no investments 

in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property 

other strategies and activities  while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit on occasion we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2008 we had a total of 425251 square feet of rentable retail space that produced gross rental revenue in 2008 of 10166000 12 of total revenue if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale at present through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a 50 partner in aria at hathorne llc we have an economic interest in the development of 64 forsale town homes at a total projected capital cost of 23621000 this forsale development is on a site that is adjacent to our avalon danvers community and that is zoned for forsale development any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code or the treasury regulations our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value proposition given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and 

  for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in this form 10k 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we project construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs may increase particularly for labor and certain materials and for some of our development communities and development rights as defined below the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

   

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy rental rates operating expenses and the overall market value of our assets including joint ventures and fund investments 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy rental rates and the operating performance of our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must develop construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

compliance with changes in i laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes may result in lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

  attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

capital and credit market conditions may continue to adversely affect our access to various sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could impact our business activities dividends earnings and common stock price among other things 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption and this has affected the amounts sources and cost of capital available to us for example during 2008 we used secured property financing more than in the past as the interest rate we incur for that source of financing has remained relatively steady and we may continue to rely more heavily on secured financings we are unable to predict whether or to what extent or for how long the current capital market conditions will persist we primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to further limit our development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income to the extent that we are able andor choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected in addition the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly andor decline in a highinterest rate or volatile economic environment we believe that the lenders under our unsecured credit line will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder but if economic conditions deteriorate further there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit and this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2008 approximately 69 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents aggressively and in consequence can also limit increases in the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a 1000000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na and wachovia bank na serving together as syndication agent and as banks bank of america na serving as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank morgan stanley bank wells fargo bank na and deutsche bank trust company americas serving collectively as documentation agent and as banks and a syndicate of other financial institutions serving as banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility our unsecured term loan and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue or other liquidity needs including the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

  we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive 

we may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008 taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends that may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

subject to the requirements related to fund ii we may in the future acquire apartment communities on a select basis our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise as noted above we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments also as noted in item 1 “business” above through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a joint venture partner we have a 50 economic interest in a 64 town home forsale development with a total estimated capital cost at completion of 23621000 on a site adjacent to one of our communities we may engage or have an interest in forsale activity in the future our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them or that we will be successful in other activities we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key 

  personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell 

risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer partnership or joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with an investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund  

we formed the fund which through a wholly owned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and in which we have invested approximately 48000000 at december 31 2008 representing an equity interest of approximately 15 this presents risks including the following 

 

we have also formed fund ii which through a wholly owned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and to which we have committed 150000000 representing a current equity interest of approximately 45 this presents risks including the following 

 

   

risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 “communities — insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in new england and the midwest we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge noncompliance with such laws and regulations may 

  subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

   

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may engage in activities through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification and to otherwise address concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole 

  discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director in a contested election if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast the incumbent directors would remain in office this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders’ best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 

   

development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

in addition we own approximately 60000 square feet of office space in alexandria virginia for our corporate office with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases 

as of december 31 2008 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

current communities 

our current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings the current communities as of january 31 2009 include 125 gardenstyle of 

  which 21 are mixed communities and include town homes 22 highrise and 17 midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following 

 

other features at various communities may include 

 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and where vacant available for immediate occupancy we believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

  our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 

 

we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2008 we completed construction of 4036 apartment homes in 13 communities and sold 3059 apartment homes in ten communities in addition the fund sold 400 apartment homes in one community the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 140 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the average age of our current communities is 87 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2009 we own 

 

we also hold directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in the 14 

  development communities all of which are currently consolidated for financial reporting purposes and three of which are subject to land leases expiring in september 2105 december 2105 and april 2106 

in our two partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2009 there were 19430 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

  development communities 

as of december 31 2008 we had 14 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 4564 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 1583800000 you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of our 2009 outlook for development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 

 

 

 28 

  redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2008 we had seven consolidated communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 95400000 excluding costs prior to redevelopment in addition the fund has two communities under redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to fundowned communities as well as communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 

 

 

 29 

  development rights 

as of december 31 2008 we are evaluating the future development of 27 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option we generally prefer to hold development rights through options to acquire land although for 14 of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 7304 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2008 there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 57365000 relating to development rights that we consider probable for future development in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 239456000 are reflected as land held for development as of december 31 2008 on the consolidated balance sheet of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are charged to expense during 2008 we incurred a charge of approximately 12500000 of predevelopment cost for development rights that we determined would not likely be developed 

refer to item i “business” for a discussion of our expected 2009 development starts in addition you should carefully review section 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

  the table below presents a summary of these development rights 

 

 

 31 

  land acquisitions 

we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2008 we acquired six land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 97174000 one of which we no longer plan to develop the land parcels purchased which are currently being developed or are held for future development are as follows 

 

 

 recent disposition activity 

we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2008 to january 31 2009 we sold our interest in ten wholly owned communities containing an aggregate of 3059 apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price from the dispositions of these assets was 564950000 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults many of our communities are near and thus susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a 100000000 limit except with respect to the state of washington for which the limit is 65000000 our earthquake insurance outside of california provides 

  for a 100000 deductible per occurrence except that the next 400000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible until the total deductible incurred exceeds 3000000 

on december 1 2007 we elected to cancel and rewrite our property insurance policy for a 17 month term in order to take advantage of declining insurance premium rates as a result our property insurance premium decreased by approximately 15 with no material changes in coverage we expect to renew this policy when it expires on may 1 2009 

in august 2008 we renewed our general liability policy and worker’s compensation coverage for a one year term and experienced a decrease in the premium on these policies of approximately 13 with no material changes in the coverage these policies are in effect until august 1 2009 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program until 2014 in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 200000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion under item 1a “risk factors — we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance” elsewhere in this report we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

we also carry crime policies also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy that protect the company up to 5000000 per occurrence from employee theft of money securities or property 







 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 25 2008 we filed a complaint in the us district court eastern district of virginia alexandria against tetra tech inc and tetra tech mm inc collectively “tetra tech” and arthur willden a tetra tech employee during the relevant period and the brother of our former employee james r willden our complaint alleges that portions of payments made by avalonbay to tetra tech were improperly passed on by tetra tech to san jose water conservation corp we previously obtained judgments against james willden san jose water conservation corp and michael schroll the president of san jose water conservation corp tetra tech has filed a counterclaim and cross complaint against avalonbay and others seeking damages in excess of 9 million we believe that tetra tech’s counterclaim is without merit with respect to avalonbay and intend to vigorously defend such claim our insurer as subrogee will have a claim to a portion of recoveries we collect if any from james willden san jose water conservation corp michael schroll andor tetra tech there can be no assurance that any meaningful amount will be collected in recovery or that we will be successful in our litigation with tetra tech 

we are currently involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act “fha” and the americans with disabilities act the equal rights center filed a complaint against us on september 23 2005 in the us district court district of maryland with respect to 100 properties the lawsuit seeks monetary damages as well as injunctive relief such as modifications to assets the company has filed a motion to dismiss all or parts of the suit which has not been ruled on yet by the court on august 13 2008 the us attorney’s office for the southern district of new york filed a civil lawsuit against the 

  company and the joint venture cvp i llc in which it has an interest that owns avalon chrystie place the lawsuit alleges that avalon chrystie place was not designed and constructed in accordance with the accessibility requirements of the fha the company designed and constructed avalon chrystie place with a view to compliance with new york city’s local law 58 which for more than 20 years has been new york city’s code regulating the accessible design and construction of apartments and which we believe satisfies the requirements of the fha due to the preliminary nature of the equal rights center and department of justice matters we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss if any that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement 

on august 1 2008 we filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of washington in the county of king  avalon downreit v lp v grandglacier llc et al relating to our assertion that the homeowners association in which our former avalon wynhaven community is a part systematically overcharged us for various shared costs we recently sold this property and agreed to indemnify the buyer for annual association fees to the extent they exceed an amount that we each agreed was reasonable the defendants have filed a crossclaim against avalon downreit v lp seeking foreclosure of the property and satisfaction of all amounts alleged to be due we intend to vigorously pursue our claim and defend against the counter claim we cannot predict the likely terms of a final judgment or settlement 

in addition to the matters described above we are involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given we do not believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our operations

executive overview 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive barrierstoentry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are located in new england the new yorknew jersey metro area the midatlantic the midwest the pacific northwest and the northern and southern california regions of the united states our strategy is to penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer our communities are predominately upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

financial highlights and outlook 

for the year ended december 31 2008 net income available to common stockholders was 401033000 compared to 349460000 for 2007 an increase of 148 the annual yearoveryear increase is primarily attributable to an increase in gains from the sale of communities and joint venture real estate investments in 2008 as compared to 2007 and growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2008 partially offset by noncash charges for land impairments abandoned pursuit costs and other charges related to our reduction in our planned development activity and other items listed in the table below 

   

 

 apartment fundamentals while in line with expectations were challenged in the second half of 2008 as the recent economic downturn accelerated we were able to achieve full yearoveryear rental revenue growth of 31 for our established community portfolio comprised entirely of an increase in rental rates of 31 with no change in occupancy this revenue growth combined with constrained expense growth contributed to our established community portfolio achieving yearoveryear growth in net operating income “noi” of 36 in 2008 however due to the decline in market fundamentals during the fourth quarter of 2008 rental revenue from established communities increased 17 and noi increased 24 over the prior year period 

we expect a decrease in earnings per share — diluted “eps” in 2009 from the prior year of approximately 50 driven primarily by the decrease in expected dispositions for 2009 contributing to these results will be an expected decline in the revenue and net operating income from our established communities in 2009 the recession coupled with the short term nature of apartment leases has adversely impacted current operating fundamentals while certain apartment markets continue to exhibit positive trends the negative impact on renter demand from net job losses is expected to result in yearoveryear declines in noi we believe that the adverse impact of the recession will be somewhat offset by i the expected continued weakness in the forsale housing market during 2009 and ii growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent in addition the level of new rental completions in the company’s markets is anticipated to decline during 2009 from 2008 levels our current financial outlook for 2009 provides for a decline in rental revenue of between 15 and 35 in our established community portfolio and a projected noi decline of 425 to 625 

while current capital market conditions continue to adversely affect access to liquidity we were able to demonstrate the benefits of the financial flexibility that comes with a largely unencumbered capital structure during the year ended december 31 2008 we raised in excess of 1900000000 of capital through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt sales of assets and joint venture partner capital commitments during 2008 we sourced approximately 1200000000 in debt at attractive prices from a variety of sources including the government sponsored enterprises taxexempt debt money center banks and even a local bank for long term secured debt in addition we achieved a record level of dispositions during 2008 selling eleven communities including one held by the fund for an aggregate gross sales price of 646200000 we anticipate our level of disposition activity to be in the range of gross sales of 100000000 to 200000000 in 2009 however our actual disposition activity may differ significantly and will depend on various factors including market and economic conditions in 2009 

we used the proceeds from both the debt financing activity and community dispositions to fund our development and redevelopment activities reduce amounts drawn under our unsecured line of credit repay secured and unsecured debt prepay certain secured debt with higher interest costs and repurchase common stock capital needs result primarily from development expenditures maturing debt and dividend requirements our committed capital is sufficient to complete the development underway and meet other liquidity uses see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

while we believe that our development activity will continue to create longterm value we reduced our expected level of development in response to the general deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions the general 

  recessionary environment as previously disclosed we do not anticipate starting any new development during the first half of 2009 development starts in the second half of 2009 if any will be evaluated based on our assessment of economic and capital market conditions at that time we do expect to increase redevelopment activity in 2009 for both wholly owned and fund as defined below related assets as a result of the reduction in our development activities we incurred certain noncash and other charges as discussed in the table above during 2008 we completed 13 communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of 1044300000 while only starting six communities which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of 491000000 during 2009 the company expects to disburse approximately 650000000 related to the 14 communities under development at december 31 2008 and expected acquisitions of land for future development we expect approximately 100000000 of the projected 2009 disbursements will be funded from cash in escrow related to previously sourced taxexempt debt 

our 2009 financial plan anticipates a continuation of poor credit markets and constrained liquidity however we believe that our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our current development and redevelopment activities we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities which could include unsecured debt andor common and preferred equity and secured debt as well as from disposition proceeds joint ventures or from retained cash we believe that the current market provides for an opportunity to perform certain deferred maintenance and repositioning activities at attractive costs due to the continued decline in costs for construction materials and labor during 2009 we expect to start 16 redevelopments of wholly owned communities as well as five redevelopments of communities on behalf of the fund as defined below 

avalonbay value added fund lp the “fund” is a discretionary investment fund with nine institutional investors including us one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of the fund and has invested approximately 48000000 in the fund representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest the fund was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in march 2008 

on september 2 2008 we announced the formation of avalonbay value added fund ii lp “fund ii” a private discretionary investment vehicle with commitments from four institutional investors including us totaling 333000000 we have committed 150000000 to fund ii representing a 45 equity interest at final closing the aggregate investor commitments to fund ii and our commitment and percentage interest in fund ii may change fund ii can employ leverage of up to 65 allowing for a total investment capacity of approximately 950000000 and has a term of ten years plus two oneyear extension options fund ii will acquire and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in our current markets with the objective of creating value through redevelopment enhanced operations andor improving market fundamentals fund ii will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investments in apartment communities for a period of three years from the closing date or until 90 of its committed capital is invested subject to limited exceptions fund ii will not include or involve our development activities we will receive in addition to any returns on its invested equity asset management fees property management fees and redevelopment fees we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met as of december 31 2008 there has been no capital contributed to fund ii and fund ii has made no investments in the fourth quarter of 2008 fund ii entered into a 75000000 unsecured credit facility with an option to increase the facility up to 200000000 subject to certain lender requirements the credit facility bears interest at libor plus 250 per annum and matures in december 2011 assuming the exercise of a oneyear extension option at december 31 2008 there was 760000 outstanding under the fund ii credit facility 

communities overview 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights ie land or options to purchase land held for development as further described in item 2 of this report our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the 

  beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” 

noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

as of december 31 2008 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 178 apartment communities containing 50292 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which 14 communities were under construction and nine communities were under reconstruction of these communities 23 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including 19 owned by the fund in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 27 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 7304 apartment homes 

  results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities noi derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of noi related to disposed communities and capital market and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for 2008 2007 and 2006 follows dollars in thousands 

 

net income available to common stockholders increased 51573000 or 148 to 401033000 in 2008 due primarily to gains from the sale of communities and yearoveryear increases in community operating performance partially offset by charges associated with land impairments and abandoned pursuits as well as increased costs for interest and depreciation net income available to common stockholders increased 91614000 or 355 in 2007 over the prior year period due primarily to sales of consolidated operating communities and investments in unconsolidated entities and related gains combined with growth in noi from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities 

noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs reconciliations of noi for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands 

   

the noi increases for both 2008 and 2007 as compared to the prior year period consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 

 

the noi increases in established communities in 2008 were largely due to continued favorable but moderating apartment market fundamentals during 2008 we continued to focus on rental rate growth while maintaining occupancy of at least 95 in all regions 

we anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will decline in 2009 such that overall rental revenue will decline between 15 and 35 as compared to the 31 growth achieved in 2008 the expected revenue decline is due to the general decline in overall economic conditions and related employment levels expense growth also impacts growth in noi and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth we expect operating expenses to increase between 30 and 40 in 2009 from prior year levels attributable primarily to increases in property taxes utilities insurance and office operations as a result we expect noi for our established communities to decline between 425 and 625 these projections are based on our outlook for economic conditions in 2009 both nationally and in the markets where we operate there can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions andor their impact on our operating results will be accurate and actual results could differ materially please see “risk factors” “forward looking statements” and other discussions in this report on form 10k for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations 

net operating income “noi” is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes

rental and other income increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 

overall portfolio — the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes decreased to 37886 apartment homes for 2008 as compared to 38436 homes for 2007 and 37716 homes for 2006 this change is primarily the result of communities sold during 2008 containing 3459 apartment homes as well as declining occupancy levels due to the economic slow down partially offset by increased homes available from newly developed communities the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 1921 for 2008 as compared to 1767 in 2007 and 1610 in 2006 

  established communities — rental revenue increased 18221000 or 31 for 2008 and increased 34257000 or 55 for 2007 these increases are due entirely to increased average rental rates for 2008 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 31 to 1928 compared to 1870 in 2007 primarily due to increased market rents there was no change in yearoveryear average economic occupancy for 2008 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in established communities’ rental revenue in all six of our regions for 2008 as compared to the prior year period the largest percentage increases in rental revenue were in the northern california and pacific northwest regions with increases of 59 and 52 respectively between years almost 70 of our established community revenue is generated by the metro new yorknew jersey northern california and the new england regions and are discussed in more detail below 

the metro new yorknew jersey region which accounted for approximately 238 of established community rental revenue for 2008 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 23 for 2008 as compared to 2007 average rental rates increased 24 to 2353 and economic occupancy decreased 01 to 962 for 2008 as compared to 2007 during 2008 the trend of weakening rental market conditions in both new york city and surrounding suburban markets resulting from the recession is reflected in the declining occupancy levels in the second half of 2008 the challenges facing the financial services industry are expected to continue throughout 2009 resulting in a further decline in employment levels we will remain focused on the current market conditions as we seek to manage the resulting impact on our community operating results for 2009 

northern california which represented approximately 211 of established community rental revenue during 2008 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 59 as compared to 2007 average rental rates increased by 62 to 1943 and economic occupancy declined by 03 from 970 to 967 for 2008 as compared to 2007 we expect northern california to see a modest decline in revenue in 2009 

the new england region accounted for approximately 210 of the established community rental revenue for 2008 and experienced rental revenue growth of 23 over the prior year average rental rates increased 22 to 2053 and economic occupancy increased 01 to 963 for 2008 as compared to 2007 given the significance of the financial services industry in the boston metro area as well as the impact of new york trends on fairfieldnew haven we continue to monitor the recent decline in job growth as compared to 2007 due to the current volatility in the financial services industry 

in accordance with gaap cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term which is generally one year as a supplemental measure we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions as well as current rental market conditions 

the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years 2008 and 2007 dollars in thousands information for the year ended december 31 2006 is not presented as established community classification is not comparable prior to january 1 2007 see note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

   

management development and other fees increased 426000 or 69 in 2008 and decreased 117000 or 19 in 2007 the increase in 2008 was due primarily to increased redevelopment fees and property management fees as additional communities were acquired by the fund the decrease in 2007 was due primarily to lower development and redevelopment management fees coupled with the disposition of our interest in a joint venture partially offset by increased management fees from fund communities 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 19666000 or 108 in 2008 and increased 16472000 or 100 for 2007 as compared to the prior year periods primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 521000 or 04 to 133459000 for 2008 and 1661000 or 11 to 148628000 for 2007 due primarily to increased utilities administrative and community maintenance related costs offset partially by a decrease in insurance and payroll related expenses the increases in administrative expense are primarily due to increases in bad debt due to a general decline in the economic climate 

property taxes increased 6705000 or 95 and 7911000 or 126 in 2008 and 2007 respectively due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 

for established communities property taxes increased by 3107000 or 56 and 2618000 or 45 for 2008 and 2007 respectively due to both higher assessments throughout all regions and reductions in property taxes realized in 2007 that did not occur in 2008 the impact of the current economic environment has not been reflected in current assessments as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments we expect property taxes in 2009 to increase over 2008 due primarily to higher tax rates without the benefit of lower assessed values property tax increases are limited by law proposition 13 for communities in california we evaluate property tax increases internally as well as engage thirdparty consultants and appeal increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by 1247000 or 32 in 2008 and 4450000 or 130 in 2007 over the prior year periods these increases are due primarily to increased compensation and employee separation costs as well as costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities the 2008 expense includes transition and ongoing costs related to our customer care center in virginia beach virginia that we opened in the third quarter of 2007 to centralize certain communityrelated accounting administrative and customer service functions 

investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions investment management and abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment of development pursuits acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits investments and investment management costs increased in 2008 and 2007 compared to the prior year periods due primarily to increases in abandoned pursuit costs abandoned pursuit costs were 12511000 in 2008 6974000 in 2007 and 2115000 in 2006 the increase in abandoned pursuit costs in 2008 is due to the reduction in our planned development activity these costs can be volatile 

  particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future periods 

interest expense net increased 20338000 or 215 and decreased 11731000 or 110 in 2008 and 2007 respectively this category includes both interest expense and interest income the increase in 2008 is due primarily to a decrease in interest income in 2008 as compared to the prior year period coupled with increased interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007 the higher level of interest income in 2007 is due to higher invested cash balances from our january 2007 equity offering the increased interest expense in 2008 is due primarily to increased amounts of debt outstanding in 2008 compared to the prior year period in addition interest expense in 2008 was reduced by including the gain of 1950000 recognized by repurchasing 15000000 of our 250000000 55 unsecured notes at a discount of 87 of par for 13050000 interest expense also includes charges of approximately 410000 related to unamortized deferred financing costs and purchase premiums for debt that was repaid prior to its scheduled maturity 

depreciation expens e increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities 

general and administrative expense “ga” increased 14287000 or 501 in 2008 and increased 3727000 or 150 in 2007 as compared to the prior year periods the 2008 increase is due primarily to compensation including severance and related costs associated with the decrease in our planned development activity federal excise tax expense resulting from gains on our increased disposition activity during 2008 and organization costs for the formation of fund ii the 2007 increase is primarily due to increased compensation costs 

impairment loss for 2008 is due primarily to the write down of eight land parcels which we have decided to not develop we did not recognize an impairment loss in either 2007 or 2006 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities for 2008 decreased from the prior year period due primarily to the gain on the sale of two partnership interests in 2007 and the related loss of partnership income partially offset by our portion of the gain from the sale of a community by a joint venture partner income from joint ventures where the underlying communities have achieved stabilized operations and gains from our investment in a joint venture formed to develop forsale homes the increase in 2007 over the prior year period is due primarily to approximately 60000000 in gains from the dispositions of two investments in 2007 

minority interest in consolidated partnerships for 2008 resulted in income of 741000 compared to expense of 1585000 in 2007 due to recognition of income for our joint venture partners’ portion of the net loss incurred by fund ii as well as the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2007 and 2008 thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests the increase in 2007 over the prior year period is due primarily to the recognition in 2007 of the sale of a 70 joint venture partner interest in one of our unconsolidated communities partially offset by the redemption of limited partnership units as discussed above 

gain on sale of land for 2008 decreased from the prior year period due to the absence of land sales in 2008 gain on sale of land from 2007 decreased from 2006 due to the volume and size of parcels sold each year 

income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2007 through december 31 2008 this income decreased for 2008 and 2007 due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period see note 7 “real estate disposition activities” of our consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of communities increased in 2008 and 2007 as compared to the prior year periods as a result of a higher volume of sales in each respective year the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 

  funds from operations attributable to common stockholders “ffo” 

ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance in calculating ffo we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere this report for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital 

we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

the capital and credit markets contracted significantly during 2008 resulting in a constrained liquidity environment although general market liquidity was constrained we were able to satisfy our liquidity needs from a combination of cash flows provided by secured and unsecured financings proceeds from asset sales and cash from operations in 2009 we continue to expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources including borrowing capacity under our credit facility as defined below secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below as well as our operating activities to the extent that currently available internal and external resources do not satisfy our needs we may seek additional external financing additional external financing could come from a variety of sources such as public sales of debt or equity securities or unsecured or secured loans from financial institutions or other private or governmental lenders among others private equity through joint ventures may also be used our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or shortterm financial prospects at december 31 2008 we have unrestricted cash and cash in escrow of 259305000 available for development activities for the year ended december 31 2008 we raised in excess of 1900000000 of capital through the issuance of secured debt and unsecured debt equity commitments from private equity sources and sales of assets we used these proceeds to fund our development and redevelopment activities reduce amounts drawn under our unsecured line of credit repay secured and unsecured debt prepay certain unsecured debt with interest costs above prevailing rates and repurchase our common and preferred stock 

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 65706000 at december 31 2008 an increase of 45435000 from 20271000 at december 31 2007 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing 

  and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities — net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 386855000 in 2008 from 454874000 in 2007 the decrease was driven primarily by the payment of interest amounts and the timing of general corporate payables partially offset by the additional noi from our established communities as well as noi from recently developed communities 

investing activities — net cash used in investing activities of 266309000 in 2008 related to investments in assets through the development and redevelopment of apartment communities partially offset by the gross proceeds from the disposition of communities in the amount of 529777000 and an increase in construction escrows of 126611000 during 2008 we invested 902327000 in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures 

 

financing activities — net cash used by financing activities totaled 75111000 in 2008 the net cash used is due primarily to the payment of cash dividends in the amount of 278795000 the redemption of preferred stock for 100000000 and the repurchase of 482100 shares of our common stock at an average price of 8742 per share offset somewhat by the net issuance of secured and unsecured debt of 350054000 including amounts repaid under our credit facility as defined below 

in february 2008 our board of directors authorized an increase of 200000000 in our common stock repurchase program increasing the total amount the company can acquire to 500000000 of which approximately 300000000 has been used to repurchase our common stock as of december 31 2008 the decision to use the additional share repurchase authorization will depend on current capital market conditions and liquidity our share price relative to the net asset value per share and other uses of capital including development 

in october 2008 we exercised our option to redeem all 4000000 outstanding shares of our 870 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock for 100701000 the repayment amount includes the redemption value of the outstanding shares of 25 per share and accrued but unpaid dividends through the redemption date we recorded a noncash charge for deferred offering expenses of approximately 3566000 in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to this redemption 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we currently have a 1000000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in november 2011 assuming our exercise of a oneyear renewal option in the aggregate we pay an annual facility fee of approximately 1250000 the credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 040 per annum 085 on january 31 2009 the spread over libor can vary from libor plus 0325 to libor plus 100 based on our credit rating in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 422500000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january 31 2009 at january 31 2009 335000000 was outstanding on the credit facility 45415000 was used to provide letters of credit and 619585000 was available for borrowing under the credit facility 

we are subject to certain customary financial and other covenants under the credit facility our 330000000 variable rate unsecured term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued the financial covenants include the following

 

we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2008

  future financing and capital needs — debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid substantially prior to maturity if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our credit facility or by equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following financing activity occurred during 2008 

 

   

in january 2009 we made a cash tender offer for any and all of our 75 unsecured notes due august 2009 and december 2010 we purchased 37438000 of our 150000000 75 unsecured notes due august 2009 at par in addition we purchased 64423000 of our 200000000 75 unsecured notes due december 2010 at a discount price of 98 of par for approximately 63135000 representing a yield to maturity of 866 a gain of approximately 1062000 will be recorded in the first quarter of 2009 in conjunction with the purchase of the unsecured notes due december 2010 all of the notes purchased in the tender offer were cancelled we previously acquired and cancelled an aggregate of 10000000 of the 75 unsecured notes due in august 2009

   future financing and capital needs — dividend requirements 

as a reit we are subject to certain dividend distribution requirements in relation to taxable income to avoid paying federal income and federal excise taxes at the corporate level during 2008 we sold 11 communities including one community sold by the fund absent a special distribution in excess of our normal recurring quarterly dividend we would have had taxable income in excess of distributions resulting in federal income tax at the corporate level to qualify for the dividends paid deduction for tax purposes and minimize this potential tax in december 2008 we declared a combined special and regular dividend the “combined dividend” of 270 per share comprised of a special dividend of 18075 the “special dividend” per share and our regular dividend of 08925 per share the company recorded a charge of 3200000 related to the expected federal excise taxes related to the gains on sale recognized during 2008 

future financing and capital needs — portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2008 we had 14 new communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 666623000 remained to be invested in addition we had nine communities which we own or in which we have a direct or indirect interest under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 53214000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

 

before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the fund or fund ii as discussed below or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights writeoff associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

on september 2 2008 we announced the formation of fund ii a private discretionary investment vehicle with commitments from us and four institutional investors fund ii has equity commitments totaling 333000000 we have committed 150000000 to the fund representing a 45 equity interest fund ii will acquire and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in our current markets with the objective of creating value through redevelopment enhanced operations andor improving market fundamentals fund ii will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investments in apartment communities until 2011 or earlier when 90 of its committed capital is invested subject to limited exceptions fund ii will not include or involve our development activities we will receive in addition to any returns on our invested equity asset management fees property 

  management fees and redevelopment fees we will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met as of january 31 2009 there have been no capital contributions to fund ii and fund ii has not made any investments in the fourth quarter of 2008 fund ii entered into a 75000000 unsecured credit facility with an option to increase the facility up to 200000000 subject to certain lender requirements the credit facility bears interest at libor plus 250 per annum and matures in december 2011 assuming the exercise of a oneyear extension option at december 31 2008 there was 760000 outstanding under the fund ii credit facility 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 

 

   

 

there are no other lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 

contractual obligations 

we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of longterm debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space during the third quarter of 2008 we entered into an operating land lease agreement relating to our avalon walnut creek community currently under development aside from this lease there have not been any other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2008 scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2008 dollars in thousands 

   

 

 inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed you should not rely on 

  forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” in this document for a discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

in addition these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the guidance of fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities ” as revised and 

  emerging issues task force issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” for investment interests that we do not consolidate we look to the guidance in aicpa statement of position 789 “accounting for investments in real estate ventures” accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” and emerging issues task force topic d46 “accounting for limited partnership investments” to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of these rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2008 our assets would have increased by 953524000 and our liabilities would have increased by 723395000 we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct and those indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any project specific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2008 our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our operating expenses would have increased by 3034000 

we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of 

  development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are written off with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the acquisition or development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if it were determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuits were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2008 would have decreased by 5737000 

asset impairment evaluation 

we apply the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” for our consolidated operating apartment communities development communities and development rights to determine the need for performing impairment analyses as well as to measure the loss if an impairment has occurred on a regular basis considering qualitative economic factors  we also apply the provisions of sfas 144 for assessing the need to perform an impairment analysis and measuring impairment losses on the underlying longlived assets held by our unconsolidated joint venture investments in addition we apply the provisions of apb no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” “apb 18” to determine if there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures because each asset is unique requiring significant management judgment we believe that the asset impairment evaluation under sfas 144 and the assessment of other than temporary declines in fair value under apb 18 are critical accounting estimates 

for both analyses management judgment is required both to determine if a significant event has occurred such that an impairment analysis is necessary as well as for the assessment and measurement of any potential impairment under apb 18 in the event that there has been a loss in value for an investment a loss is only recognized if it is other than temporary which requires management judgment

to perform the sfas 144 impairment analysis we must estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset which in the case of an apartment community would be the cash flows from operations and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset forecasting cash flows requires assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period rental rates occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period as well as disposition proceeds in addition when an impairment has occurred we must estimate the discount factor or market capitalization rate to apply to the undiscounted cash flows to derive the fair value of the position the market capitalization rate is influenced by many factors including national and local economic conditions as well as the location and quality of the asset 

our analysis of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under apb 18 considers our ability to recover the carrying amount of our investment by evaluating the current fair value of the net assets underlying the investment using our estimate of the forecasted cash flows that the asset will generate including any incremental cash flows from investment management or other fees related to the investment disposition proceeds and an estimated market capitalization rate our estimate of the fees considers various factors including any contractually guaranteed amounts and expected periods over which the fees will be earned in the event that the current fair value of our investment considering the above factors is less than our current carrying basis an impairment exists we must then determine if the impairment is other than temporary whether an impairment is other than temporary is a subjective determination primarily considering the ability of the joint venture entity to generate cash flows from operations the expected proceeds from the disposition of our position and whether our expected investment horizon is adequate to recover any unrealized loss in the fair value of our investment 

changes in the future cash flows associated with an asset have a direct linear relationship to the fair value of the position for example holding all other variables constant if there is a 10 decline in the estimated cash flows from operations for a community there would be a corresponding decrease in the fair value of that asset of 10 changes in the market capitalization rate have an inverse relationship with the fair value of an asset with a decrease in the market capitalization rate resulting in an increase in the fair value of the asset for example an asset that is valued at 80000000 when using a five percent market capitalization rate will increase in value to 100000000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by one 

  percent to four percent and to 133000000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by two percent to a three percent market capitalization rate 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized an impairment loss of 57899000 associated with certain land parcels which we no longer intend to develop at december 31 2008 we determined that none of our consolidated operating communities development communities or investments in unconsolidated joint ventures were impaired under the provisions of sfas 144 or apb 18 as appropriate these conclusions were based on the factors that existed as of december 31 2008 given the recent deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed or the likelihood of any future impairment charges if any you should also review item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 “the code” as amended for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2008 our net income would have decreased by approximately 210500000 

our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being interest rate risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 

our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates primarily associated with shortterm interest rates such as libor we had 1088848000 and 1084653000 in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2008 and 2007 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 11490000 and 6417000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness not for trading or speculative purposes under swap agreements 

   

as of december 31 2008 the effect of interest rate swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately 44937000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate taxexempt debt was not electively entered into by us but rather was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain taxexempt bond financings had these swap agreements not been in place during 2008 and 2007 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 1451000 and 931000 lower respectively based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2008 and 2007 and these swap agreements had not been in place our annual interest costs would have been approximately 887000 and 248000 lower respectively 

because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our variable rate credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 3552492000 at december 31 2008 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 3569817000 at december 31 2008 fixed rate debt excluding our variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented 2531244000 of the carrying value and 2548569000 of the fair value at december 31 2008 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2008 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by 88723000 

we do not have any exposure to foreign currency or equity price risk and our exposure to commodity price risk is insignificant

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states we focus on these markets because we believe that over the long term a limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets in addition to increasing the rental revenues of our operating assets we believe these market attributes will increase the value of our operating assets and enable us to create additional value through the development and selective acquisition of multifamily housing 

at january 31 2008 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring an existing community in selecting sites for development or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year development redevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

  our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value by successfully and costeffectively developing redeveloping acquiring owning and operating highquality communities in our selected markets that contain features and amenities desired by residents as well as by providing our residents with efficient and effective service to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such that we maintain continuous access to costeffective capital our longterm strategy is to more deeply penetrate the high barriertoentry markets in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

during the three years ended december 31 2007 excluding acquisition for the fund we acquired two apartment communities and executed the buyout of our partner’s 75 interest in a joint venture that owns an apartment community all three communities’ financial results are consolidated for financial reporting purposes during the same threeyear period we disposed of 15 apartment communities disposed of one investment in a real estate joint venture and completed the development of 21 apartment communities and the redevelopment of 10 apartment communities including communities we redeveloped for the fund as defined below in anticipation of favorable apartment fundamentals and to help position us for future growth we increased our construction volume during 2007 as measured by total projected capitalized cost at completion and continued to secure new development opportunities including the acquisition of land for future development we also increased our investments in apartment communities through an institutional discretionary investment fund avalonbay value added fund lp the “fund” which we manage and in which we own a 15 interest to create value the fund acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance since its inception in march 2005 the fund has acquired 20 communities a more detailed description of the fund and its investment activity can be found in the discussion under item i “business – general – financing strategy” and note 6 “investments in real estate entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report as a result of strong capital flows to the industry we also continued to dispose of assets at prices that provided significant realized gains 

in 2008 we expect additional new development starts to be in the range of 900000000 to 1100000000 measured at total projected cost of completion and anticipate an increase in our redevelopment activity for both whollyowned assets and assets of the fund we also anticipate asset sales in the range of 700000000 to 1000000000 dependent on strategic and value realization opportunities the level of development acquisition and disposition activity however is heavily influenced by capital market conditions including prevailing interest rates a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

  development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however as a result of the recent competitive market conditions for land suitable for development we recently have acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning we currently own land that is held for development with an aggregate carrying basis under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” of 288423000 on which we have not yet commenced construction

except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers when we start construction we act as our own general contractor and construction manager we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure highquality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

when there is increased competition for desirable development opportunities we will in some cases be engaged in more complicated development pursuits for example at times we have acquired and may in the future acquire existing commercial buildings with the intent to pursue rezoning tenant terminations or expirations and demolition of the existing structures during the period that we hold these buildings for future development the net revenue from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

  redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have established procedures to reduce both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure highquality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phase 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when market conditions are favorable and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities when we decide to sell a community we solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio in 2005 we formed the fund which since then has served as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquired additional investments in apartment communities subject to limited exceptions at december 31 2007 the fund had invested 777568000 we expect that the fund will invest approximately 46000000 of additional funds to redevelop the assets acquired at which time the fund will become fully invested we are exploring various potential sources and vehicles for funding future acquisitions after the fund is fully invested 

property management strategy  we expect to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we expect to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we control operating expenses in a variety of ways which include the following among others 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

  we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a wholly owned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” and is therefore subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to maintain a capital structure that provides us with flexibility in meeting the financial obligations and opportunities presented by our real estate development and ownership business at december 31 2007 our debttototal market capitalization was 303 and our longterm floating rate debt which includes amounts outstanding on our variable rate unsecured credit facility was 102 of total market capitalization total market capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of our common stock the market value of our operating partnership units outstanding based on the market value of our common stock the liquidation preference of our preferred stock and the outstanding principal amount of our debt we believe that debttototal market capitalization can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company’s longterm liquidity and balance sheet strength because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the company’s common stock trades however because debttototal market capitalization changes with fluctuations in our stock price which occur regularly our debttototal market capitalization may change even when our earnings and debt levels remain stable 

we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility and sales of current operating communities if required to meet the balance of our current or anticipated liquidity needs we will borrow funds under our existing unsecured credit facility sell existing communities or land andor issue additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and long term liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint venture or partnership our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community who may prefer that or who may require less payment if the land or community is contributed to a joint venture or partnership ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle is used investments in joint ventures or partnerships are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 

since its inception in 2005 the fund has served as the principal vehicle through which we have invested in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions these exceptions included significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund the fund does not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions the fund has nine institutional investors including us with a combined equity capital commitment of 330000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors are being made through avalonbay value added fund inc a maryland corporation that qualifies as a reit under the internal revenue code the “fund reit” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed 50000000 to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately 43399000 has been invested as of january 31 2008 representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest as of january 31 2008 the fund had invested 779318000 with an additional expected net investment of 39000000 to redevelop the assets acquired we are exploring various potential sources and vehicles for funding future acquisitions after the fund is fully invested 

  in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property 

other strategies and activities  while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit on occasion we own and lease retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2007 we had a total of 405122 square feet of rentable retail space that produced gross rental revenue in 2007 of 7790000 10 of total revenue if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale at present through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a 50 partner in aria at hathorne llc we have an economic interest in the development of 64 forsale townhomes at a total projected capital cost of 23636000 on a site that is adjacent to our avalon danvers community and that is zoned for forsale development any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code or the treasury regulations the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value proposition given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

  environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” other information 

we file annual quarterly and current reports proxy statements and other information with the sec you may read and copy any document we file at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20002 you may call the sec at 1800sec0330 for further information on the operation of the public reference room our sec filings are also available to the public from the sec’s website at wwwsecgov in addition you may read our sec fillings at the offices of the new york stock exchange “nyse” which is located at 20 board street new york new york 10005 our sec filings are available at the nyse because our common stock and an outstanding series of preferred stock are listed on the nyse

we were incorporated under the laws of the state of california in 1978 in 1995 we reincorporated in the state of maryland and have been focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time as of december 31 2007 we had 1898 employees 

  


 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements on page 55 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we project construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs have been increasing particularly for materials such as steel concrete and lumber and for some of our development communities and development rights the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” including 

 

   

costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy rental rates or operating expenses 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy or rental rates at our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations including landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes may result in lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

  insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit and this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur variable interest rate debt in addition we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2007 approximately 47 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents aggressively and in consequence can also limit increases in the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a 1000000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na and wachovia bank na serving together as syndication agent and as banks bank of america na serving as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank morgan stanley bank wells fargo bank na and deutsche bank trust company americas serving collectively as documentation agent and as banks and a syndicate of other financial institutions serving as banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be hard to sell these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

subject to the requirements related to the fund we may in the future acquire apartment communities on a select basis our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise as noted in the business description above we also own and lease retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments also as noted in the business description above through a taxable reit subsidiary that is a joint venture partner we have a 50 economic interest in a 64 townhome forsale development with a total estimated capital cost at completion of 23636000 on a site adjacent to one of our communities we may engage or have an interest in forsale activity in the future our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them or that we will be successful in other activities we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures we may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell 

  risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer partnership or joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with an investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund  

we have formed the fund which through a whollyowned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and to which we have committed 50000000 representing an equity interest of approximately 15 this presents risks including the following 

 

if we were to employ a similar vehicle to fund acquisitions in the future such vehicle could present similar risks to us or similar requirements that our acquisition activity be conducted primarily through the vehicle 

risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 “communities – insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available 

  a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in the northeast and midwest we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of several of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

  all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operation in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

  we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may engage in activities through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification and to otherwise address concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director in a contested election if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast the incumbent directors would remain in office this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders’ best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

  item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 

development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

in addition we own approximately 60000 square feet of office space in alexandria virginia for our corporate office with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases 

  as of december 31 2007 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

current communities 

our current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings the current communities as of january 31 2008 include 123 gardenstyle of which 14 are mixed communities and include townhomes 21 highrise and 19 midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following 

 

other features at various communities may include 

 

   

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and where vacant available for immediate occupancy we believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 

 

we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2007 we completed construction of 1749 apartment homes in eight communities acquired one whollyowned community containing 80 apartment homes and sold 982 apartment homes in four communities in addition the fund acquired 1491 apartment homes in seven communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 153 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the average age of our current communities is 97 years

we also hold directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 21 of the development communities all of which are currently consolidated for financial reporting purposes 

in our two partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2008 there were 64019 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

  development communities 

as of december 31 2007 we had 21 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 6816 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 2162500000 you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 

 

 

   

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2007 we had five consolidated communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 65000000 excluding costs prior to redevelopment in addition the fund has three communities under redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to fundowned communities as well as communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 

 

 

  development rights 

as of december 31 2007 we are evaluating the future development of 48 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option we generally hold development rights through options to acquire land although for 21 of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 13656 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2007 there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 60996000 relating to development rights that we consider probable for future development in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 288423000 are reflected as land held for development as of december 31 2007 on the consolidated balance sheet of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense during 2007 we incurred a charge of approximately 7000000 for pursuits for which we determined it was not probable that we would proceed with development 

you should carefully review section 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

  the table below presents a summary of these development rights 

 

  

   

recent developments 

we seek to increase the value of our interests and increase our presence in selected high barriertoentry markets where we believe we can 

 

to achieve this increased value creation and presence we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction from january 1 2007 to january 31 2008 we disposed of our interest in five communities including one partnership interest to our joint venture partner in a community previously held by a joint venture entity containing an aggregate of 1384 apartment homes the aggregate gross sales price from the dispositions of these assets was 268096000 

  land acquisitions  we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2007 we acquired 17 land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of 311691000 the land parcels purchased which are currently being developed or are held for future development are as follows

   insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults a large concentration of our communities lies near and thus is susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building the five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of 100000 per occurrence earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a 100000000 limit except with respect to the state of washington for which the limit is 65000000 our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence in addition up to a policy aggregate of 2000000 the next 400000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible 

on may 1 2007 we renewed our property insurance policy for a 12 month term on december 1 2007 we elected to cancel and rewrite this policy for a 17 month term in order to take advantage of declining insurance premium rates as a result our property insurance premium decreased by approximately 15 with no material changes in coverage the policy now expires on may 1 2009 

our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage renewed on august 1 2007 this policy is in effect until july 31 2008 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2007 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act “tripra” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal backstop program until 2014 in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 200000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tripra such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tripra coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that results from terrorist acts at our communities 

an additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion on environmental contamination we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

  





 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are currently involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act the lawsuit equal rights center v avalonbay communities inc was filed on september 23 2005 in the federal district court in maryland the plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts as well as injunctive relief such as modification of existing communities an award of attorneys’ fees expenses and costs of suit the company has filed a motion to dismiss all or parts of the suit which has not been ruled on yet by the court due to the preliminary nature of the litigation we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this lawsuit nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss if any that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement 

we are seeking compensatory damages as well as punitive and treble damages in a complaint we filed in october 2007 in the us district court eastern district of virginia alexandria against a former vice president of the company who had authority over repair and capital improvements at existing communities  avalonbay communities inc v james r willden  the complaint alleges among other things that the former employee colluded to receive payments from a vendor in exchange for approving invoices we previously filed a complaint in the same court against this vendor and its president a valonbay communities inc v san jose water conservation corp and michael p schroll we are investigating these and other payments approved by or under the supervision of this former employee and may amend these complaints or file additional complaints we do not expect that the loss related to this matter will be material to our results of operations or financial condition 

in addition to the matters described above we are involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given we do not believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our operations

executive overview 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we believe that apartment communities are an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive barrierstoentry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer our communities are predominately upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

financial highlights and outlook 

net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended december 31 2007 was 129644000 as compared to 44138000 for the quarter ended december 31 2006 an increase of 1937 for the year ended december 31 2007 net income available to common stockholders was 349460000 compared to 257846000 for 2006 an increase of 355 these increases are primarily attributable to an increase in gains from the sale of communities and joint venture real estate investments in 2007 as compared to 2006 and growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2007 

apartment fundamentals remained positive in 2007 as evidenced by full yearoveryear rental revenue growth of 55 achieved within our established community portfolio as defined later in this report comprised of an increase in rental rates of 58 and a decrease in occupancy of 03 this revenue growth combined with constrained expense growth contributed to our established community portfolio achieving yearoveryear growth in net operating income “noi” of 72 in 2007 for the fourth quarter of 2007 our established communities experienced an increase in rental revenue of 44 and a corresponding increase in noi of 49 over the prior year period evidencing the moderating but continued growth in operations 

projected growth in earnings per share — diluted “eps” in our current financial outlook is expected to be between 484 and 941 driven primarily by gains on the sale of communities that may occur under our expanded disposition program in addition we expect that our established communities will continue to show revenue and net operating income growth in 2008 but at a lesser rate relative to growth levels in 2007 despite third party forecasts of a weaker economic environment we anticipate positive renter demand resulting from a continued reduction in homeownership rates and a general increase in the propensity to rent declining home ownership rates are the result of a number of factors including concerns regarding home prices and economic growth demographic growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent as well as tighter underwriting standards for mortgages management expects the level of new rental completions in the company’s markets will decline modestly during 2008 from 2007 levels and competition from unsold housing inventory made available for rent will remain modest relative to more oversupplied residential markets in the us overall we expect apartment market fundamentals will be balanced in our markets supporting moderate growth in earnings our current financial outlook provides for 2008 rental growth of 25 to 40 in our established community portfolio and projected noi growth of 30 to 45 

  we expect that our development activity will continue to create longterm value we currently have approximately 2162500000 under construction measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion including the portions in which joint venture partners hold an equity or economic interest for 2008 we expect new development starts in the range of 900000000 to 1100000000 measured at projected cost of completion including projects that may be developed through joint ventures this is a decrease in new activity from 2007 reflecting the current economic and capital market conditions we continue to be selective in pursuing new development opportunities land prices generally have not reset in most of our markets but we are seeing construction cost increases stabilizing construction costs for certain materials have begun to decline while prices for other materials remain high given strong global demand there is also greater availability of experienced subcontractors and trade professionals as a result of slowing construction in both the condominium and singlefamily housing markets we continue to selectively secure new development rights including the acquisition of land for future development we currently have development rights for construction of new apartment communities that would if developed as expected total approximately 3918000000 based on total projected capitalized costs at december 31 2007 we also expect to increase our redevelopment activities in 2008 for both wholly owned and fund as defined below related assets while current market conditions with respect to liquidity may impact the types of funding sources used we believe that our current level of indebtedness our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing on our assets provide us with the financial position and financial flexibility to access the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities we expect to meet these needs from both secured and unsecured debt as well as asset sales and retained cash 

avalonbay value added fund lp the “fund” is a discretionary investment fund in which we hold a 15 interest the fund has been our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities subject to certain exceptions since its formation in march 2005 the fund acquired seven communities for an aggregate purchase price of 305450000 during 2007 as of january 31 2008 the total amount invested by the fund is 779318000 management of the fund expects to invest approximately 39000000 of additional funds to redevelop the assets acquired at which time the fund will become fully invested we are exploring various potential sources and vehicles for funding future acquisitions after the fund is fully invested 

we continue to see real estate capital flows from income investors in 2007 we completed the disposition of four communities and one partnership interest for an aggregate gross sales price of 268096000 given the current levels of demand from investors for high quality multifamily real estate assets we anticipate increasing our level of disposition activity to a range of 700000000 to 1000000000 in 2008 actual disposition activity will depend on various factors including market and economic conditions 

communities overview 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights ie land or options to purchase land held for development as further described in item 2 of this report our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

  although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities and discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” 

the net operating income of our current operating communities as defined later in this report is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

as of december 31 2007 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 184 apartment communities containing 52748 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which 21 communities were under construction and eight communities were under reconstruction of these communities 23 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes including 20 owned by the fund in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 48 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 13656 apartment homes 

results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals as measured by changes in net operating income of our established communities net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market disposition and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for the years 2007 2006 and 2005 follows dollars in thousands 

   

net income available to common stockholders increased 91614000 or 355 to 349460000 in 2007 due primarily to sales of consolidated operating communities and investments in unconsolidated entities and related gains occurring in 2007 combined with growth in net operating income from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities in 2007 net income available to common stockholders decreased 43922000 or 146 to 257846000 in 2006 primarily attributable to reduced asset sales and the related gains partially offset by growth in net operating income from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities 

net operating income “noi” is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a calculation of noi for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 along with reconciliation to net income for each year is as follows dollars in thousands 

   

the noi increases in both 2007 and 2006 as compared to the prior year period consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 

 

the noi increases in established communities in 2007 were largely due to continued favorable apartment market fundamentals during 2007 we continued to focus on rental rate growth while maintaining occupancy of at least 95 in all regions we anticipate that increases in rental rates and overall rental revenue growth will moderate in 2008 as compared to 2007 as we expect a slower rate of job growth demand and a decline in new rental completions in our markets supply we expect revenue growth from our established communities of 25 to 40 in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth we expect operating expenses at our established communities to increase by 20 to 30 in 2008 as compared to 2007 from increasing property tax labor and utility expenses overall we anticipate growth in noi from our established communities of 30 to 45 in 2008 as compared to 2007 

the company has given projected noi growth in 2008 only for established communities and not on a companywide basis the company believes that noi growth of the established communities assists investors in understanding management’s estimate of the likely contribution to operations from established communities however the company has not provided a projection of noi growth on a companywide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts dispositions and acquisitions as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporatelevel property management overhead general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed disposed or acquired noi growth expected from established communities is not a projection of the company’s projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow 

rental and other income increased in 2007 as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates for our established communities coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 

overall portfolio — the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 38436 apartment homes for 2007 as compared to 37716 apartment homes for 2006 and 36520 apartment homes for 2005 this change is primarily the result of increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities partially offset by communities sold in 2007 and 2006 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 1767 in 2007 as compared to 1610 in 2006 and 1516 in 2005 

  established communities  rental revenue increased 34257000 or 55 for 2007 and increased 35871000 or 68 in 2006 these increases are due to increased average rental rates partially offset by decreased economic occupancy for 2007 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 58 to 1795 compared to 1697 in 2006 primarily due to increased market rents and the decrease in the amortization of concessions the higher amortization recognized in 2006 was due to the higher levels of concessions granted in periods prior to 2006 the average economic occupancy decreased 03 to 963 in 2007 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 

we experienced increases in established communities’ rental revenue in all six of our regions in 2007 as compared to 2006 the largest increases in rental revenue were in the pacific northwest northern california and the midatlantic with increases of 111 86 and 59 respectively between years the northeast and northern california regions comprise the majority of our established community revenue and therefore are discussed in more detail below 

northern california which represented approximately 246 of established community rental revenue during 2007 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 86 in 2007 as compared to 2006 average rental rates increased by 83 to 1699 and economic occupancy increased 03 to 970 in 2007 apartment fundamentals remain strong in northern california we expect northern california to see continued but moderating revenue growth during 2008 at growth levels in excess of those expected in other markets 

the northeast region which accounted for approximately 423 of established community rental revenue during 2007 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 32 in 2007 as compared to 2006 average rental rates increased 35 to 2129 and economic occupancy decreased 03 to 962 in 2007 we expect overall apartment fundamentals in the northeast region will be balanced during 2008 with slower job growth and except in the boston area minimal net new rental supply supplydemand fundamentals for new york city and surrounding areas should remain healthy although changes in employment levels in the financial services industry could cause economic growth to decelerate boston will continue to lag the region in revenue growth as we expect the net new supply from apartment deliveries will outpace improvement in the region’s economy these factors support our expectation for moderate rental rate growth in 2008 

in accordance with gaap cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term which is generally one year as a supplemental measure we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions as well as current rental market conditions 

the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 dollars in thousands information for the year ended december 31 2005 is not presented as established community classification is not comparable prior to january 1 2006 see note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

   

management development and other fees decreased 117000 or 19 in 2007 and increased 1955000 or 454 in 2006 the decrease in 2007 was due to lower development and redevelopment management fees coupled with the loss of fees due to the disposition of our interest in a joint venture partially offset by increased property management fees from the fund as additional communities are acquired the increase in 2006 over 2005 was due to a full year of management fees from the fund which was formed in march 2005 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 16411000 or 93 and 14014000 or 87 in 2007 and 2006 respectively primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our established communities 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 1661000 or 11 and 3030000 or 24 to 148628000 and 131106000 in 2007 and 2006 respectively due primarily to increases in other maintenance marketing and landscaping expenses offset by lower utility and redecorating costs 

property taxes increased 8126000 or 122 and 2811000 or 44 in 2007 and 2006 respectively due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes property taxes are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 

for established communities property taxes increased by 2618000 or 45 and 721000 or 14 in 2007 and 2006 respectively due to higher assessments throughout all regions year over year changes are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals  overall we expect property taxes in 2008 to increase from 2007 levels due to increased valuations and the addition of newly developed communities despite the potential decreases in real estate property values for tax purposes there is generally a lag to the ultimate recognition of any savings in the real estate tax assessments in addition property tax increases are limited by law proposition 13 for communities in california we evaluate property tax increases internally as well as engage thirdparty consultants and appeal increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by 4450000 or 130 and 2934000 or 94 in 2007 and 2006 respectively over the prior year periods due primarily to increased costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities coupled with increased compensation and relocation costs the 2007 expense includes the set up costs related to the office in virginia beach virginia that we opened in 2007 this office will be used to centralize certain communityrelated accounting administrative and customer service functions the transition began during the third quarter of 2007 when certain communityrelated accounting functions were relocated to our virginia beach office and is expected to continue through the end of 2008 expenses in this category increased in 2006 primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our established communities 

investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions investment management and abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits investments and investment management costs increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to increased abandoned pursuit costs abandoned pursuit costs were 6974000 in 2007 2115000 in 2006 and 816000 in 2005 abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future periods 

  interest expense net decreased 11639000 or 107 in 2007 and 15987000 or 128 in 2006 due primarily to higher levels of capitalized interest in connection with our increased development activity and increased interest income partially offset by an increase in the average outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility interest income increased in 2007 due to higher invested cash balances from our january 2007 equity offering as well as increases in the interest rate earned on cash deposits offset partially by interest income in 2006 from an escrow funded from a disposition in 2005 that was used in a taxdeferred exchange 

depreciation expense increased 19107000 or 119 in 2007 and 3987000 or 25 in 2006 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities partially offset by the loss of depreciation from assets sold 

general and administrative expense “ga” increased 3727000 or 150 in 2007 primarily due to increased compensation costs ga expenses decreased 994000 or 39 in 2006 primarily due to the incurrence in 2005 of the following i separation costs of approximately 2100000 due to the departure of a senior executive ii the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately 1500000 and iii increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability in 2005 partially offset by higher compensation costs in 2006 

gain on sale of land in 2007 decreased from 2006 due to the volume and size of land parcels sold in each year the increase in 2006 from 2005 is due to larger gains on sales in 2006 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities in 2007 increased from 2006 due primarily to the recognition in 2007 of approximately 60000000 in gains from the disposition of two investments partially offset by losses after depreciation associated with two unconsolidated investments and the consolidation in 2007 of a community that was not consolidated as of december 31 2006 

minority interest in consolidated partnerships increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to the recognition of the sale of a 70 joint venture partner interest in one of our consolidated communities see note 6 “investment in real estate entities” this increase was partially offset by the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests the yearoveryear decrease in 2006 was due to the conversion of limited partnership units reducing the outside ownership interests 

income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january 1 2006 through december 31 2007 it decreased in 2007 and 2006 due to fewer communities sold or classified as discontinued operations see note 7 “real estate disposition activities” of our consolidated financial statements 

gain on sale of communities increased in 2007 due to the higher volume of dispositions in 2007 the decrease in 2006 as compared to 2005 is due to the volume and size of dispositions in the respective years relative to our basis in the assets the amount of gain realized in any given reporting period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the sales prices which are driven by local and national market conditions 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholders “ffo” 

ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance in calculating ffo we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere this report for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report 

  liquidity and capital resources 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment particularly to changes in interest rates the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital 

we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

increased capital market volatility in 2007 and constrained liquidity suggest that our liquidity needs may be met in 2008 from sources that differ from historical sources increased use of secured debt and increased asset sales relative to our recent activity are expected for 2008 although general market liquidity is constrained we anticipate that we can satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 21222000 at december 31 2007 an increase of 12938000 from 8284000 at december 31 2006 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities – net cash provided by operating activities increased to 455825000 in 2007 from 351660000 in 2006 the increase was driven primarily by the additional noi from our established communities’ operations as well as noi from recently developed communities 

investing activities – net cash used in investing activities of 809247000 in 2007 related to investments in assets through the development and redevelopment of apartment communities the acquisition of a community and the acquisition of 17 land parcels partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of a land parcel four communities and a partnership interest in an unconsolidated real estate investment during 2007 we invested 1141706000 in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures 

 

   

financing activities – net cash provided by financing activities totaled 366360000 in 2007 the net cash inflow is due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of 4600000 shares of the company’s common stock at 12930 per share borrowings of 514500000 under our unsecured credit facility and the issuance of two mortgage notes for approximately 59126000 offset by the repurchase of 2480616 shares of our common stock at an average price of 10395 per share the repayment of mortgage notes of approximately 27256000 the repayment of unsecured notes at maturity of approximately 260000000 and dividend payments of 268966000 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

in november 2007 we increased our borrowing capacity under our existing revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility from 650000000 to 1000000000 the facility is with a syndicate of commercial banks to whom we pay in the aggregate an annual facility fee of approximately 1250000 the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 040 per annum 354 on january 31 2008 the spread over libor can vary from libor plus 0325 to libor plus 100 based on our credit rating in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 422500000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january 31 2008 we are subject to and currently in compliance with certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility including but not limited to maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels the credit facility matures in november 2011 assuming our exercise of a oneyear renewal option at january 31 2008 733500000 was outstanding on the credit facility 57000000 was used to provide letters of credit and 209361000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 

  future financing and capital needs – debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our unsecured credit facility or by equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our longterm liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following financing activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2007 

 

in february 2008 the board of directors authorized a further increase of 200000000 in the common stock repurchase program increasing the total amount the company can acquire to 500000000 of which approximately 300000000 has been used to repurchase our common stock as of january 31 2008 the decision to use the additional share repurchase authorization will depend on current capital market conditions and liquidity our share price relative to the net asset value per share and other uses of capital including development 

  the table below details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our unsecured credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale for debt outstanding at december 31 2007 dollars in thousands except footnotes 

 

 

 51 

   future financing and capital needs – portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2007 we had 21 new communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 943679000 remained to be invested in addition we had eight communities which we own or in which we have a direct or indirect interest under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 53836000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

 

before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the fund as discussed below or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights writeoff associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

we have invested in the fund a private discretionary investment vehicle that acquires and operates apartment communities in our markets the fund has invested 777568000 as of december 31 2007 management of the fund expects to invest approximately 46000000 of additional funds to redevelop the assets acquired at which time the fund will become fully invested the fund has nine institutional investors including us with a combined capital equity commitment of 330000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors have been made through avalonbay value added fund inc a maryland corporation that qualifies as a reit under the internal revenue code the “fund reit” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed 50000000 to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately 32035000 has been invested as of january 31 2008 representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest as of january 31 2008 the fund has committed to invest approximately 818367000 we are exploring various potential sources for funding future acquisitions after the fund is fully invested 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk or secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities in response to real estate and capital markets conditions we sold four communities and one partnership interest in an unconsolidated entitiy for an aggregate sales price of 268096000 from january 1 2007 through january 31 2008 because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs during 2008 we intend to dispose of between 700000000 and 1000000000 in assets however actual disposition volume will depend on market conditions and other variables which are subject to change in 2008 

  off balance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain offbalance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 “investments in real estate entities” and note 8 “commitments and contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 

   

there are no other lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 

contractual obligations 

we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of longterm debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space during the second quarter of 2007 we entered into an operating lease for 20000 square feet of office space in virginia beach virginia we began to utilize this space for certain of our communityrelated accounting and customer service functions in the third quarter of 2007 there have not been any other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2007 scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2007 dollars in thousands 

   

 

 inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

   

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” elsewhere in this report for a discussion of risks associated with forwardlooking statements 

in addition these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 

  we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements applying the guidance of fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities ” as revised and emerging issues task force issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” for investment interests that we do not consolidate we look to the guidance in aicpa statement of position 789 “accounting for investments in real estate ventures”  accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” and emerging issues task force topic d46 “accounting for limited partnership investments”  to determine the accounting framework to apply the application of these rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment therefore we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 

if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december 31 2007 our assets would have increased by 1029093000 and our liabilities would have increased by 739806000 we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed including but not limited to the following reasons none of which are currently expected to occur 

 

we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 

cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use for redevelopment efforts we capitalize costs beginning either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct and those indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities these costs include interest and related loan fees property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs interest is capitalized for any project specific financing as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects indirect project costs which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and as such we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to development or redevelopment activity if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs there may be an increase in our operating expenses for example if in 2007 our development activities decreased by 10 and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs our operating expenses would have increased by 2748000 

  we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense 

due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the acquisition or development of an apartment community and therefore should be capitalized the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate if it were determined that 10 of our capitalized pursuits were no longer probable of occurring net income for the year ended december 31 2007 would have decreased by 6100000 

asset impairment evaluation 

we apply the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets”  to determine the need for performing impairment analyses as well as to measure the loss if an impairment has occurred on a regular basis considering qualitative economic factors because each asset is unique requiring significant management judgment we believe that the asset impairment evaluation is a critical accounting estimate 

management judgment is required both to determine if a significant event has occurred such that an impairment analysis is necessary as well as for the assessment and measurement of any potential impairment to perform the impairment analysis we must estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset which in the case of an apartment community would be the noi as well as potential disposition proceeds for a given asset forecasting cash flows requires assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period rental rates occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period as well as disposition proceeds in addition when an impairment has occurred we must estimate the discount factor or market capitalization rate to apply to the undiscounted cash flows to derive the fair value of the position the market capitalization rate is influenced by many factors including national and local economic conditions as well as the location and quality of the asset 

changes in the future cash flows associated with an asset have a direct linear relationship to the fair value of the position for example if there is a 10 decline in the estimated noi for a community there would be a corresponding decrease in the fair value of that asset of 10 changes in the market capitalization rate have an inverse relationship with the fair value of an asset with a decrease in the market capitalization rate resulting in an increase in the fair value of the asset for example an asset that is valued at 80000000 when using a five percent market capitalization rate will increase in value to 100000000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by one percent to four percent and to 133000000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by two percent to a three percent market capitalization rate 

for the year ended december 31 2007 we did not recognize any impairment in value associated with our investments or longlived assets we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 “the code” as amended for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years for example if we failed to qualify as a reit in 2007 our net income would have decreased by approximately 119800000 

  our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment therefore we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being interest rate risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 

our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates primarily associated with shortterm interest rates such as libor we had 1084653000 and 426795000 in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2007 and 2006 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 6417000 and 3027000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness not for trading or speculative purposes under swap agreements 

 

as of december 31 2007 the effect of interest rate swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately 46340000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate taxexempt debt was not electively entered into by us but rather was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain taxexempt bond financings had these swap agreements not been in place during 2007 and 2006 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 931000 and 1182000 lower respectively based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2007 and 2006 and these swap agreements had not been in place our annual interest costs would have been approximately 248000 lower in 2007 and 37000 higher in 2006 

  because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 2696203000 at december 31 2007 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 2756890000 at december 31 2007 fixed rate debt excluding our variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented 2079713000 of the carrying value and 2140400000 of the fair value at december 31 2007 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2007 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by 84459000 

we do not have any exposure to foreign currency or equity price risk and our exposure to commodity price risk is insignificant

avalonbay communities inc the “company” which term unless the context otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states we focus on these markets because we believe that long term the limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets in addition to increasing the rental revenues of our operating assets we believe these market attributes will increase the value of our operating assets and enable us to create additional value through the development and selective acquisition of multifamily housing 

at january 31 2007 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community in selecting sites for development redevelopment or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but that had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year development redevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value by successfully and costeffectively developing redeveloping acquiring owning and operating highquality communities in our selected markets that contain features and amenities desired by residents as well as by providing our residents with efficient and effective service 

  to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such that we maintain continuous access to costeffective capital our longterm strategy is to more deeply penetrate the high barriertoentry markets in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

during the three years ended december 31 2006 we acquired two apartment communities whose financial results are consolidated for financial reporting purposes disposed of 16 apartment communities and completed the development of 20 apartment communities and the redevelopment of six apartment communities in anticipation of continued improvement in apartment fundamentals and to help position us for future growth we increased our construction volume during 2006 as measured by total projected capitalized cost at completion and continued to secure new development opportunities including the acquisition of land for future development we also increased our investments in apartment communities through an institutional discretionary investment fund avalonbay value added fund lp the “fund” which we manage and in which we own approximately a 15 interest the fund acquired communities that we believe we can redevelop or reposition or take advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance to create value since its inception in march 2005 the fund has acquired 13 communities a more detailed description of the fund and its investment activity can be found in financing activities and note 6 “investments in unconsolidated entities” of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report as a result of strong capital flows to the industry we also continued to dispose of assets at prices that enabled significant realized gains on cost 

in 2007 we expect additional new development activity to be in the range of 1000000000 to 1300000000 and we expect the fund will continue to selectively acquire additional communities we also anticipate asset sales dependent on strategic and value realization opportunities the level of development acquisition and disposition activity however is heavily influenced by capital market conditions including prevailing interest rates a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however we will acquire and hold land when business conditions warrant due to increased competition for land based on current market conditions we have at times acquired land earlier in the development cycle or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning after we acquire land we generally shift our focus to construction except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers we act as our own general contractor and construction manager 

  we generally perform these functions directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure highquality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

as competition for desirable development opportunities has increased in recent years we will in some cases be engaged in more complicated development pursuits for example at times we have acquired and may in the future acquire existing commercial buildings with the intent to pursue rezoning tenant terminations or expirations and demolition of the existing structures generally during the period that we hold these buildings for future development the net revenue from these operations which we consider to be incidental is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital we have established procedures to minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure highquality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phase 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence acquisitions and dispositions also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio in 2005 we formed the fund which during its investment period ending no later than march 2008 will be the principal vehicle for us to acquire additional investments in apartment communities subject to certain exceptions through the fund’s investment period or until fully invested we expect to continue our acquisition activity through the fund focusing in particular on communities in our markets that can benefit from redevelopment repositioning or market cycle opportunities 

property management strategy  we intend to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities and controlled operating expenses 

  our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we control operating expenses in a variety of ways which include the following among others 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly although we may use a whollyowned subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” and is therefore subject to federal income taxes 

financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to maintain a capital structure that is aligned to the business risks presented by our corporate strategy for the year ended december 31 2006 our fixed charge ratio on an incurred and expensed basis was 190 and 268 respectively we believe that fixed charge coverage is an important measure of balance sheet strength as it measures our ability to service fixed payment obligations from operating cash flow at december 31 2006 our debttototal market capitalization was 223 and our longterm floating rate debt was 34 of total market capitalization total market capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of our common stock the market value of our operating partnership units outstanding based on the market value of our common stock the liquidation preference of our preferred stock and the outstanding principal amount of our debt we believe that debttototal market capitalization can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company’s longterm liquidity and balance sheet strength because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the company’s common stock trades however because debttototal market capitalization changes with fluctuations in our stock price which occur regularly our debttototal market capitalization may change even when our earnings and debt levels remain stable 

  we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash and borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility if required to meet the balance of our current or anticipated liquidity needs we will attempt to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility sell existing communities or land andor issue additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and long term liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint venture or partnership our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community who may prefer that or who may require less payment if the land or community is contributed to a joint venture or partnership ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle is used investments in joint ventures or partnerships are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 

we have invested in the fund a private discretionary investment vehicle that acquires and operates apartment communities in our markets the fund will serve until march 16 2008 or until 80 of its committed capital is invested as the principal vehicle through which we will invest in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund the fund will not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions the fund has nine institutional investors including us with a combined equity capital commitment of 330000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors are being made through avalonbay value added fund inc a maryland corporation that qualifies as a reit under the internal revenue code the “fund reit” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed 50000000 to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately 22944000 has been invested as of january 31 2007 representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest under the fund documents the fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65 on a portfolio basis which if achieved would enable the fund to invest up to 940000000 we currently expect that leverage of less than 65 will be employed reducing the projected investment value to between 850000000 and 900000000 of which approximately 514000000 has been invested as of january 31 2007 

in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property 

other strategies and activities  while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit on occasion we own and operate retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2006 we had a total of 327010 square feet of rentable retail space that produced gross rental revenue in 2006 of 5258000 07 of total revenue if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale at present we expect to develop with the intent to sell directly through a taxable reit subsidiary or indirectly through a joint venture partnership one or more land parcels any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

  we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code or the treasury regulations the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other apartment reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value proposition given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete with the condominium and singlefamily home markets although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities for some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements on page 65 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities including significant environmental remediation or construction work in highdensity urban areas these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we project construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs have been increasing particularly for materials such as steel concrete and lumber and for some of our development communities and development rights the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” including 

 

  costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy or rental rates 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy or rental rates at our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations including landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability 

compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes may result in lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

  insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit and this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur variable interest rate debt accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2006 approximately 7 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under use limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents aggressively and in consequence can also limit increases in the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a 650000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na and wachovia bank na serving together as syndication agent and as banks bank of america na serving as administrative agent swing lender issuing bank and a bank morgan stanley bank wells fargo bank na and deutsche bank trust company americas serving collectively as documentation agent and as banks and a syndicate of other financial institutions serving as banks our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and our ability to maintain our status as a reit significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be hard to sell especially if market conditions are poor these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

subject to the requirements related to the fund we may in the future acquire apartment communities on a select basis our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise as noted in the business description above we also own and operate retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments also as noted in the business description above we expect to develop through a taxable reit subsidiary directly or through a joint venture partnership one or more parcels with the intent to sell which we believe represents the best use for those parcels our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them or that we will be successful in these other activities we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures we may be unsuccessful in owning and operating retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell 

  risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer partnership or joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with an investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund  

we have formed the fund which through a whollyowned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and to which we have committed 50000000 representing an approximate 15 equity interest this presents risks including the following 

 

risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 “communities – insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes is expensive due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable 12 

  

there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in the northeast and midwest we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination or noncompliance 

under various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

the development construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances which regulate matters including wetlands protection storm water runoff and wastewater discharge noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws and the common law may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of several of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operation in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates 13 

  

there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 14 

  

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may engage in activities through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification and to otherwise address concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director in a contested election if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast the incumbent directors would remain in office this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders’ best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 

development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

in addition we own approximately 60000 square feet of office space in alexandria virginia for our corporate office with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases 

  as of december 31 2006 communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

current communities 

our current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings in january 2007 the fund acquired one community containing 392 apartment homes the current communities as of january 31 2007 include 115 gardenstyle of which 15 are mixed communities and include townhomes 21 highrise and 15 midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following 

 

other features at various communities may include 

 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and where vacant available for immediate occupancy 

  we believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 

 

we manage and operate substantially all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2006 including communities owned by joint ventures and the fund we completed construction of 1368 apartment homes in six communities acquired 1397 apartment homes in six communities and sold 1036 apartment homes in four communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 141 years when adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date the average age of our current communities is 93 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2007 we own 

 

   

we also hold directly or through whollyowned subsidiaries the full fee simple ownership interest in 17 of the development communities 

in each of our five partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2007 there were 144955 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

1 for the purpose of this table current communities excludes communities held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures 

  development communities 

as of december 31 2006 we had 17 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 5153 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 1323300000 you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 

 

 

 

   

 

redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2006 we had three consolidated communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be 25800000 excluding costs prior to redevelopment in addition the fund has three communities under redevelopment we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate we anticipate increasing our redevelopment activity related to fundowned communities as well as communities in our current operating portfolio you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 

 

 

  development rights 

as of december 31 2006 we are evaluating the future development of 54 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold either a purchase or lease option we generally hold development rights through options to acquire land although for 18 of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 14185 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2006 there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 39365000 relating to development rights that we consider probable for future development in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 209568000 are reflected as land held for development as of december 31 2006 on the consolidated balance sheet of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense 

you should carefully review section 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

  the table below presents a summary of these development rights 

 

   

recent developments 

sales of existing communities we seek to increase the value of our interests and increase our presence in selected high barriertoentry markets where we believe we can 

 

to achieve this increased value creation and presence we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction we sold four communities including one community previously held by a joint venture entity containing an aggregate of 1036 apartment homes during the period from january 1 2006 through january 31 2007 net proceeds from the sale of these assets were 218492000 

  land acquisitions  we select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2006 we acquired nine land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of 91574000 the land parcels purchased which are currently being developed or are held for future development are as follows 

 

 

in addition in january 2007 we acquired a parcel of land located in brooklyn ny for approximately 70000000 we expect to begin construction of this highrise community in the second half of 2007 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review the discussion under item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults a large concentration of our communities lies near and thus is susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building the five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of 100000 per occurrence earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a 100000000 limit except with respect to the state of washington for which the limit is 65000000 our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 

  100000 deductible per occurrence in addition up to a policy aggregate of 2000000 the next 400000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible 

we renewed the first 15000000 layer of our property insurance policy on may 1 2006 we renewed the remaining layers on this policy on december 1 2006 at that time we elected to renew most of these layers so that they will now expire on may 1 2007 in order to mitigate the risk of cost escalation and align the renewal date for the upper layers with the renewal date for the primary layer 

our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage renewed on august 1 2006 we have completed our negotiations with the incumbent carrier and the insurance coverage provided for in these renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2005 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance extension act “triea” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 200000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under triea such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides triea coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities triea is scheduled to expire on december 31 2007 it is uncertain if congress will extend triea and continue to provide federal support for terrorism insurance if congress does not extend triea the cost and availability of terrorism insurance may be in question 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities for further discussion of the risks and the company’s related prevention and remediation activities please refer to the discussion on environmental contamination we cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities 

  





 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are currently involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act the lawsuit equal rights center v avalonbay communities inc was filed on september 23 2005 in the federal district court in maryland the plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts as well as injunctive relief such as modification of existing communities an award of attorneys’ fees expenses and costs of suit the company has filed a motion to dismiss all or parts of the suit which has not been ruled on yet by the court due to the preliminary nature of the litigation we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this lawsuit nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss if any that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement 

on january 11 2007 a former leasing consultant of the company individually and on behalf of other leasing consultants allegedly similarly situated filed suit against the company in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that the company did not pay all leasing consultants overtime as required under the fair labor standards act the company disputes this allegation and maintains that it has accurately tracked and paid all leasing consultants overtime as required by law we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit nor is it reasonably possible at this time to estimate the amount of loss if any that would be associated with an adverse decision 

in addition to the matters described above we are involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given we do not believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to facilitate an understanding of our business and results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report this report including the following mda contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events or trends as described more fully under “forwardlooking statements” on page 65 of this report actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in item 1a “risk factors” of this report 

overview 

business description 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 

we believe that apartment communities present an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new rental household formations are expected to outpace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle barrierstoentry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we believe that over an entire real estate cycle lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger revenue and cash flow increases relative to other markets however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003 resulting in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals ie the ratio of demand including from new renter household formations to supply as reflected in declining rental revenue and demand however 2004 was a year of transition with apartment fundamentals further improving in 2005 and 2006 the economic upturn as evidenced by job growth and declining unemployment claims and modest increases in net supply are contributing to the current strong apartment market fundamentals 

  financial highlights and outlook 

strong apartment fundamentals in 2006 were evidenced by the yearoveryear rental revenue growth of 68 achieved within our established community portfolio as defined later in this report during the year ended december 31 2006 comprised of an increase in rental rates of 63 and an increase in occupancy of 05 this revenue growth combined with constrained expense growth contributed to our established community portfolio achieving yearoveryear growth in net operating income “noi” of 91 in 2006 for the fourth quarter of 2006 our established communities experienced an increase in rental revenue of 74 and a corresponding increase in noi of 109 over the prior year period our strongest operating performance since 2001 

we expect the positive revenue and net operating income growth of established communities to continue in 2007 but at a more moderate pace modest net new supply low home affordability and continued but moderating job growth should support favorable apartment fundamentals we expect modest increases in net rental supply in our markets in 2007 that will remain below the national average the singlefamily housing market continues to moderate such that the increase in home prices is flat or down and forsale inventory has increased however the current gap between the cost to rent and the cost to own continues to make rental apartments an economically attractive housing alternative in our markets these recent trends increase the likelihood that potential home buyers will extend the period they rent a home finally we expect that job growth will continue in our markets however at a more modest rate in 2007 accordingly we expect apartment market fundamentals to remain strong in our markets such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply our current financial outlook provides for rental revenue growth of 50 to 65 in our established community portfolio in 2007 and projected noi growth of 55 to 75 

in positioning for future growth we have increased our development activity and our investments in development rights as discussed below we currently have in excess of 1300000000 under construction measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion including the portions in which joint venture partners hold an equity or economic interest for 2007 we expect additional new development activity to be in the range of 1000000000 to 1300000000 in addition we continue to secure new development rights including the acquisition of land for future development we currently have development rights for construction of new apartment communities that based on total projected capitalized cost if developed as expected total approximately 3600000000 

we continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund the “fund” in which the company holds an interest of approximately 15 during its investment period which will end on or before march 16 2008 the fund will be our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities subject to certain exceptions the fund acquired five communities for an aggregate purchase price of 223670000 during 2006 and has approximately 115000000 under contract for acquisition in early 2007 as of january 31 2007 the total amount invested by the fund is 514000000 we expect the fund to continue to focus on acquisition opportunities where value can be created generally through redevelopment repositioning and market cycle timing opportunities 

real estate capital flows remain strong with income investors seeking to acquire existing apartment communities as a result opportunities to realize value upon disposition have continued to be available in 2006 we sold four communities one through a joint venture  for an aggregate sales price of 261850000 resulting in a gain in accordance with gaap of 104020000 we expect asset sales of approximately 150000000 to 200000000 in 2007 

for new development the slowing forsale market has resulted in increased investment opportunities we are being selective in pursuing these opportunities given continued high land prices and construction costs in addition we are seeing greater availability of experienced subcontractors and development and construction professionals as a result of slowing construction in both the condominium and singlefamily housing markets these positives are somewhat offset by higher construction and development costs 

communities overview 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights ie land or options to purchase land held for development as further described in item 2 of this report 

  our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities and discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” 

the net operating income of our current operating communities as defined later in this report is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

as of december 31 2006 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 167 apartment communities containing 48294 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which 17 communities were under construction and six communities were under reconstruction in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 54 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 14185 apartment homes 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different estimates or assumptions had been made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of a number of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements

we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when development efforts commence until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken outofservice for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue 

  we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense 

we generally capitalize only nonrecurring expenditures we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 15000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident under this policy a significant portion of our capitalized costs are nonrecurring as recurring makeready costs are expensed as incurred recurring makeready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements ii floor coverings iii interior painting and iv other redecorating costs because we expense recurring makeready costs such as carpet replacements our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover we capitalize purchases of personal property such as computers and furniture only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds 2500 we generally expense replacements of personal property 

in 2006 2005 and 2004 the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions development and redevelopment were 677587000 425170000 and 347091000 respectively for established and other stabilized communities we recorded nonrevenue generating capital expenditures of 18000000 or 497 per apartment home in 2006 16753000 or 471 per apartment home in 2005 and 12347000 or 354 per apartment home in 2004 in addition revenue generating or expense saving capital expenditures such as water sub metering equipment and cable installations were 153000 817000 and 637000 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home including carpet and appliance replacements related to these communities was 1638 in 2006 1546 in 2005 and 1348 in 2004 historically we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased we expect to return to the trend of gradual increases in maintenance costs in future years 

asset impairment evaluation 

we assess the impairment of our investments and longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable for both our consolidated and unconsolidated entities factors that could trigger an assessment for impairment include but are not limited to i underperformance of the asset relative to historical or expected future operating results ii significant change in legal and economic factors iii incurrence of costs significantly in excess of amounts originally forecasted for construction or acquisition of an asset or iv an expectation that a longlived asset will be disposed of at an amount below the current carrying value we evaluate the key factors necessary in the assessment of asset impairment on a quarterly basis in 2006 2005 and 2004 we did not recognize any impairment in value associated with our investments or longlived assets we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 “the code” as amended for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100 of taxable income over time periods allowed under the code to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 

  results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market disposition and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 follows dollars in thousands 

 

net income available to common stockholders decreased 43979000 or 140 to 269699000 in 2006 this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced asset sales and related gains in 2006 partially offset by growth in net operating income from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities net income available to common stockholders increased 102633000 or 486 to 313678000 in 2005 this increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of assets in 2005 including the gain related to the sale of a technology investment as well as increased net operating income from established communities and newly developed communities 

net operating income “noi” is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes 

  noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a calculation of noi for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 along with a reconciliation to net income for each year is as follows dollars in thousands 

 

the noi increases in both 2006 and 2005 as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 

 

  

the noi increase in established communities in 2006 was largely due to the improved apartment market fundamentals during 2006 we focused on rental rate growth while maintaining occupancy of at least 95 in all regions we will continue to seek increases in rental rates however we anticipate that increases in rental rates and overall rental revenue growth may moderate in 2007 as we expect continued but moderating job growth demand and increased net supply as compared to recent periods we expect revenue growth from our established communities of 50 to 65 in 2007 as compared to 2006 in addition although we will continue to aggressively manage operating expenses there is upward pressure on operating expenses from increasing utility labor insurance and property tax expenses we expect operating expenses at our established communities to increase by 35 to 50 in 2007 as compared to 2006 overall we anticipate growth in noi from our established communities of 55 to 75 in 2007 as compared to 2006 

the company has given projected noi growth in 2007 only for established communities and not on a companywide basis the company believes that noi growth of the established communities assists investors in understanding management’s estimate of the likely contribution to operations from established communities 

  however the company has not provided a projection of noi growth on a companywide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts dispositions and acquisitions as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporatelevel property management overhead general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed disposed or acquired noi growth expected from established communities is not a projection of the company’s projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow 

rental and other income increased in 2006 due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities we expect the strong apartment fundamentals experienced in 2006 to continue in 2007 but at a more moderate pace 

overall portfolio — the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 37716 apartment homes for 2006 as compared to 36520 apartment homes for 2005 and 34540 apartment homes for 2004 this change is primarily the result of an increase in the overall occupancy rate and increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities partially offset by communities sold in 2006 and 2005 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 1610 in 2006 as compared to 1516 in 2005 and 1477 in 2004 

established communities  rental revenue increased 35871000 or 68 in 2006 and increased 16523000 or 36 in 2005 the increases in 2006 and 2005 are due to both increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy as compared to the prior years for 2006 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 63 to 1647 compared to 1549 in 2005 primarily due to increased market rents and decreased concessions the average economic occupancy increased from 960 in 2005 to 965 in 2006 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents we expect rental revenue from established communities to increase 50 to 65 in 2007 as compared to 2006 

we experienced increases in established communities’ rental revenue in all six of our regions in 2006 as compared to 2005 the largest increases in rental revenue were in the pacific northwest the midatlantic and northern california with increases of 101 89 and 84 respectively between years the northeast and northern california regions comprise the majority of our established community revenue and therefore are discussed in more detail below 

northern california which represented approximately 274 of established community rental revenue during 2006 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 84 in 2006 as compared to 2005 average rental rates increased by 79 to 1561 in 2006 and economic occupancy increased 05 to 967 in 2006 apartment fundamentals improved in northern california in 2006 resulting in accelerated revenue growth in this region we expect northern california to see continued revenue growth in 2007 

the northeast region which accounted for approximately 365 of established community rental revenue during 2006 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 45 in 2006 as compared to 2005 average rental rates increased 44 to 2032 in 2006 and economic occupancy increased 01 to 965 during 2006 we expect job growth in 2007 to increase slightly over the growth levels experienced in 2006 in the northeast and net supply to increase however we expect overall apartment fundamentals will remain favorable resulting in moderate rental rate growth in the northeast during 2007 the company believes that northern new jersey will lead the region in revenue growth as a result of the strong apartment fundamentals in neighboring new york city we expect boston massachusetts will lag the region in revenue growth as economic recovery is not occurring as quickly as in other areas of the region 

in accordance with gaap cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term which is generally one year as a supplemental measure we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 

  rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions as well as current rental market conditions 

the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 dollars in thousands information for the year ended december 31 2004 is not presented as established community classification is not comparable prior to january 1 2005 see note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

 

management development and other fees increased in 2006 and 2005 due to increased asset management property management and redevelopment fees earned from the fund the fund was formed in march 2005 and continues to grow through purchases acquiring five more communities in 2006 in addition construction and development fees earned from unconsolidated entities in 2006 and 2005 contributed to increased fee income 

direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased in both 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our established communities 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 3088000 or 26 to 120487000 in 2006 due primarily to increases in payroll maintenance and utility costs partially offset by decreases in marketing and office and administration expenses during 2005 direct property operating expenses increased 965000 or 09 to 104346000 in 2005 due primarily to increases in utility maintenance and payroll costs partially offset by decreases in marketing and bad debt expenses we expect operating expenses for established communities to increase by 35 to 50 in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily as a result of continued higher utility and payroll costs as well as increased insurance costs 

property taxes increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 

for established communities property taxes increased by 721000 or 14 in 2006 and 2527000 or 57 in 2005 due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years we expect property taxes to continue to increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 to reflect increased valuations however property tax increases are mitigated for communities in california where increases in property taxes are limited by law proposition 13 we evaluate property tax increases internally as well as engage thirdparty consultants and appeal increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to increased compensation as well as increased costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities 

  investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions investment management and abandoned pursuit costs which include costs incurred on development pursuits not yet considered probable for development as well as the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits investments and investment management increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due primarily to increased compensation costs and increased staffing related to management of the fund redevelopment activity coupled with an increase in abandoned pursuit costs abandoned pursuit costs were 2115000 in 2006 816000 in 2005 and 1726000 in 2004 abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future years 

interest expense net decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due primarily to higher levels of capitalized interest in connection with our increased development activity lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility and increased interest income in addition through a maturity and the subsequent issuance of unsecured notes we reduced the effective annual interest rate on 150000000 of debt by approximately 1 these decreases in interest expense are partially offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt in 2006 and the timing of the repayment and reissuance of unsecured debt in 2005 interest income increased in 2006 due to higher invested cash balances as well as increases in the interest rate earned on cash deposits in addition interest income in 2006 includes interest earned on an escrow funded from a disposition in 2005 that was used in a taxdeferred exchange 

depreciation expense increased in both 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities coupled with the timing of depreciation expense for a community previously classified as held for sale 

general and administrative expense “ga” decreased in 2006 and increased in 2005 relative to the prior years primarily due to the incurrence in 2005 of the following i separation costs of approximately 2100000 due to the departure of a senior executive ii the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately 1500000 and iii increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability in 2005 partially offset by higher compensation costs in 2006 we expect expensed overhead costs including ga corporatelevel property management and investments and investment management to increase approximately 60 to 75 in 2007 as compared to 2006 in support of the company’s continued growth 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities in 2006 includes our share of gain on the sale of a joint venture community in the amount of 6609000 and the release of amounts previously withheld in escrow allowing recognition of the final installment of the gain from the sale of our investment in rentcom to ebay in the amount of 433000 equity in income of unconsolidated entities in 2005 includes the initial gain recognized in the amount of 6252000 related to the sale of our investment in rentcom to ebay 

minority interest in consolidated partnerships decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the conversion of limited partnership units thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests however minority interest increased in 2005 due to the consolidation of an entity under fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” as revised in december 2003 effective january 1 2004 we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note in accordance with fin 46 we did not hold an equity interest in this entity and therefore 100 of the entity’s net loss was recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships during the year ended december 31 2004 in october 2004 we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity upon repayment of the mortgage note our economic interest in this entity ended and therefore we discontinued consolidation as this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under fin 46 

gain on sale of land in 2006 represents the gain on sale of three land parcels located in danvers massachusetts jersey city new jersey and stamford connecticut during 2005 we sold three land parcels one located in dublin california one in madison washington and one in freehold new jersey 

  income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from january 1 2004 through december 31 2006 see note 7 “real estate disposition activities” of our consolidated financial statements the decreases in 2006 and 2005 are due to the sale of three consolidated communities in 2006 seven communities and one office building in 2005 and five communities in 2004 eliminating the income generated from the assets upon disposition 

gain on sale of real estate assets decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the volume and size of dispositions coupled with the carrying value of the communities sold gain on sale of real estate assets increased in 2005 and decreased in 2004 due to the volume and size of dispositions in each year the amount of gain realized in any given reporting period depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the sales price which are driven by local and national market conditions 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is a result of the implementation of fin 46 discussed above and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under fin 46 and the previously recorded net assets 

funds from operations attributable to common stockholders “ffo” 

ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance in calculating ffo we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation these amounts are generally excluded in the industry definition of ffo as amounts can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities as well as general economic and market conditions operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment particularly to changes in interest rates the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital 

we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as other public or private sources of liquidity 

  cash and cash equivalents totaled 8567000 at december 31 2006 an increase of 2852000 from 5715000 at december 31 2005 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities – net cash provided by operating activities increased to 351943000 in 2006 from 306248000 in 2005 the increase was driven primarily by the additional noi from our established communities’ operations as well as noi from recently developed communities partially offset by the loss of noi from the four communities sold in 2006 as discussed earlier in this report 

investing activities – net cash used in investing activities of 511371000 in 2006 related to investments in assets through the development redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions during 2006 we invested 832337000 in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures 

 

we disposed of four communities one through a joint venture for an aggregate sales price of 261850000 and a total gain in accordance with gaap of 104020000 we also disposed of three parcels of land for an aggregate sales price of 19635000 and a total gain in accordance with gaap of 13519000 in addition we received proceeds in the amount of 20482000 from the sale of a 70 interest in our investments in avalon del rey apartments llc for further discussion see note 6 “investments in unconsolidated entities” included in item 8 of this report 

financing activities – net cash provided by financing activities totaled 162280000 in 2006 the net cash inflow is due primarily to the proceeds from 500000000 of unsecured notes that we issued in september 2006 partially offset by the 150000000 of unsecured notes that was repaid upon maturity in july 2006 in addition net cash provided by financing activities includes the issuance of common stock for option exercises and the issuance of secured mortgage loans partially offset by dividends paid and repayment of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility see note 3 “notes payable unsecured notes and credit facility” and note 4 “stockholders’ equity” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

variable rate unsecured credit facility 

we entered into a 650000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks jpmorgan chase bank wachovia bank na and bank of america na led the syndication effort in varying capacities under the terms of the credit facility we may elect to increase the facility up to 1000000000 provided that one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such an increase such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds we pay participating banks in the aggregate an annual facility fee of approximately 813000 the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 040 per annum 572 on january 31 2007 

  the spread over libor can vary from libor plus 0325 to libor plus 100 based on our credit rating in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 422500000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january 31 2007 we are subject to certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility including but not limited to maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels the credit facility matures in november 2011 assuming our exercise of a oneyear renewal option at january 31 2007 no amounts were outstanding on the credit facility 38088000 was used to provide letters of credit and 611912000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 

future financing and capital needs – debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our longterm liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following debt activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2006 

 

in january 2007 the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing us to sell an undetermined number or amount of certain debt and equity securities as defined in the prospectus in addition in january 2007 in conjunction with the inclusion of our common stock in the sp 500 index we issued 4600000 shares of our common stock at 12930 per share net proceeds of approximately 594000000 will be used for general corporate purposes 

  the table below details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our unsecured credit facility for debt outstanding at december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 61 

  future financing and capital needs – portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2006 we had 17 new communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 639458000 remained to be invested in addition we had six communities which we own or in which we have a direct or indirect interest under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 13791000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

 

before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the fund as discussed below or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights writeoff associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

we have invested in the fund a private discretionary investment vehicle that acquires and operates apartment communities in our markets the fund will serve until march 16 2008 or until 80 of its committed capital is invested as the principal vehicle through which we will invest in the acquisition of apartment communities subject to certain exceptions these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund the fund will not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions the fund has nine institutional investors including us with a combined equity capital commitment of 330000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors are being made through avalonbay value added fund inc a maryland corporation that qualifies as a reit under the internal revenue code the “fund reit” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed 50000000 to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately 22944000 has been invested as of january 31 2007 representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest under the fund documents the fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65 on a portfolio basis which if achieved would enable the fund to invest up to 940000000 of which approximately 514000000 has been invested as of january 31 2007 we currently expect that leverage of less than 65 will be employed reducing the projected investment value to between 850000000 and 900000000 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk or secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement however we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

  in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities in response to real estate and capital markets conditions we sold four communities including an investment held in a joint venture with net proceeds in the aggregate of approximately 218492000 from january 1 2006 through january 31 2007 because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses and noi however we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 

off balance sheet arrangements 

in addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities we have certain off balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 “investments in unconsolidated entities” and note 8 “commitments and contingencies” of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 

   

there are no other lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 

  contractual obligations 

we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of longterm debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

   

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors which we describe in item 1a “risk factors” elsewhere in this report may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements 

in addition these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report we do not undertake a duty to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report 

some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being interest rate risk we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 

our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates we had 426795000 and 209165000 in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2006 and 2005 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 3027000 and 3990000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

  we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness not for trading on speculative purposes under swap agreements 

 

as of december 31 2006 the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately 65800000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate taxexempt debt was not electively entered into by us but rather was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain taxexempt bond financings had these swap agreements not been in place during 2006 and 2005 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 1182000 and 1878000 lower respectively based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2006 and 2005 and these swap agreements had not been in place our annual interest costs would have been approximately 37000 higher in 2006 and 1200000 lower in 2005 

because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 2828508000 at december 31 2006 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 2939717000 at december 31 2006 fixed rate debt excluding our variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented 2324513000 of the carrying value and 2435722000 of the fair value at december 31 2006 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2006 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by 102909000 

we do not have any exposure to foreign currency or equity price risk and our exposure to commodity price risk is insignificant

 item 1 business 

general 

avalonbay communities inc is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we engage in the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of multifamily communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states we focus on these markets because we believe that long term the limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle in addition to increasing the rental revenues of our operating assets we believe these market attributes will increase the value of our operating assets and enable us to create additional value through the development and selective acquisition of multifamily housing 

at january 31 2006 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 

 

we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community in selecting sites for development redevelopment or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining 

our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year but that had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year development redevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value by successfully and costeffectively developing redeveloping acquiring owning and operating highquality communities in our selected markets that contain features and amenities desired by residents as well as by providing our residents with efficient and effective service to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets with growing or high potential for demand and high forsale housing costs iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value 

  created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such that we maintain continuous access to costeffective capital our longterm strategy is to more deeply penetrate the high barriertoentry markets in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

during the three years ended december 31 2005 we acquired nine apartment communities disposed of 25 apartment communities and completed the development of 21 apartment communities and the redevelopment of four apartment communities in anticipation of continued improvement in apartment fundamentals and to help position us for future growth we increased our construction volume during 2005 as measured by total projected capitalized cost at completion and continued to secure new development opportunities including the acquisition of land for future development we also acquired communities that we believe we can redevelop or reposition or take advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance to create value these communities were acquired through the institutional discretionary investment fund that we manage and own an interest in as a result of strong capital flows to the industry and the strength of the condominium market we also continued to dispose of assets at prices that enabled significant realized gains on cost 

in 2006 we expect our construction underway to exceed 2005 levels and we will continue to selectively acquire additional communities through the fund we anticipate additional asset sales but at reduced levels compared to 2005 the level of development acquisition and disposition activity however is heavily influenced by capital market conditions including prevailing interest rates a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition acquisition property management and related strategies follows 

development strategy we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive office in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following cities 

 

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks and preserves capital however we will acquire and hold land when business conditions warrant due to increased competition for land based on current market conditions we have at times acquired land earlier in the development cycle or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning after we acquire land we generally shift our focus to construction except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers we act as our own general contractor and construction manager we generally perform these functions directly and not through a subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure highquality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase 

  as competition for desirable development opportunities has increased in recent years we have engaged in more complicated development pursuits for example at times we have acquired and may in the future acquire existing commercial buildings with the intent to pursue rezoning tenant terminations or expirations and demolition of the existing structures generally while we hold these buildings for development the revenue from these operations net of any operating expenses is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income we have also participated and may in the future participate in master planned or other large multiuse developments where we commit to build infrastructure such as roads to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties such as municipal garages or parks costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services particularly with large scale urban infill developments we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction 

throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle 

redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to generally renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is one of the highest quality apartment communities or best rental values for an apartment community in its local area we have established procedures to minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure highquality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phase 

throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle 

disposition strategy we sell assets when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal 

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target from time to time in order to achieve rapid penetration into markets that are generally supply constrained and in which we desire an increased presence or to help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio we have acquired existing apartment communities in 2005 we closed on the fund which during its investment period ending no later than march 2008 will be our exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities subject to certain exceptions over the next several years we expect to increase our acquisition activity through the fund focusing in particular on communities in our markets that can benefit from redevelopment repositioning or market cycle opportunities 

property management strategy  we intend to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities and controlled operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include 

 

  controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we control operating expenses as follows 

 

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income produced at their respective communities we use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions maintenance decisions and financial management 

we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly and not through a subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner 

from time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” and is therefore subject to federal income taxes we have used taxable reit subsidiaries on a limited basis such as to receive a commission from a recommended vendor used by residents 

financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to maintain a capital structure that is aligned to the business risks presented by our corporate strategy at december 31 2005 our debttototal market capitalization was 261 and our longterm floating rate debt not including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility was 23 of total market capitalization total market capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of our common stock the market value of our operating partnership units outstanding based on the market value of our common stock the liquidation preference of our preferred stock and the outstanding principal amount of our debt we believe that debttototal market capitalization can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company’s longterm liquidity and balance sheet strength because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the company’s common stock trades however because debttototal market capitalization changes with fluctuations in our stock price which occurs regularly our debttototal market capitalization may change even when our earnings and debt levels remain stable 

we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash and borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility if required to meet the balance of our current or anticipated liquidity needs we will attempt to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility sell existing communities or land andor issue additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and long term liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint venture or partnership our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community who may prefer that or who may require less payment if the land or community is contributed to a joint venture or partnership ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle is used investments in joint ventures or partnerships are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 

we have invested in the avalonbay value added fund lp a private discretionary investment vehicle the “fund” which will acquire and operate apartment communities in our markets the fund will serve until march 16 2008 or until 80 of its committed capital is invested as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire apartment communities subject to certain exceptions these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund if any the fund will not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions the fund has nine institutional investors including us with combined capital commitments of 330000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors are being made through avalonbay value added fund inc a maryland corporation that will qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the “fund reit” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed 50000000 to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately 11600000 has been invested as of january 31 2006 representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest under the fund documents the fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65 on a portfolio basis which if achieved would enable the fund to invest up to 940000000 

in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property 

other strategies and activities  while we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit on occasion we own and operate retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2005 we had a total of 269289 square feet of rentable retail space that produced gross rental revenue in 2005 of 3896000 055 of total revenue if we secure a development right and believe that its best use in whole or in part is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset we may through a taxable reit subsidiary develop real estate for sale at present we expect to develop with the intent to sell directly through a taxable reit subsidiary or indirectly through a joint venture partnership one or more parcels any investment in securities of other entities and any development of real estate for sale is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations gross income tests and other limitations that must be observed for reit qualification 

we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code or the treasury regulations the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 

  inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases 

tax matters 

we filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 

competition 

we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other apartment reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value proposition given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete with the condominium and singlefamily home markets although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents 

environmental and related matters 

as a current or prior owner operator and developer of real estate we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental factors at our communities for some development communities we undertake significant environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of toxins during construction these and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in item 1a “risk factors”

we were incorporated under the laws of the state of california in 1978 in 1995 we reincorporated in the state of maryland and have been focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time as of december 31 2005 we had 1647 employees 

  


 item 1a risk factors 

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences including those described below this item 1a includes forwardlooking statements you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements on page 61 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities these activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

we project construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty construction costs have been increasing particularly for materials such as steel concrete and lumber and for some of our development communities and development rights the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community determined in accordance with gaap including 

 

  costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 

unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could hurt occupancy or rental rates 

local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy or rental rates at our communities the risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following 

 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability 

we must operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations including landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability we are currently engaged in settling a lawsuit related to our handling of security deposits in california see “legal proceedings” 

compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or iii other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the use and operation of our communities including changes to building codes and fire and lifesafety codes may result in lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 

our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents including other rental apartments condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and singlefamily homes for sale competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates 

attractive investment opportunities may not be available which could adversely affect our profitability 

we expect that other real estate investors including insurance companies pension funds other reits and other wellcapitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties this competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability 

  insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk 

we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest in this regard we note that we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit and this requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments the principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments therefore we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock 

we currently have and may in the future incur variable interest rate debt accordingly if interest rates increase our interest costs will also rise unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable 

we have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and therefore the interest rate is generally more favorable to us these obligations are commonly referred to as “taxexempt bonds” and generally must be secured by communities as a condition to obtaining taxexempt financing or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds eg 50 or 80 of area median income or who meet other qualifying tests as of december 31 2005 approximately 61 of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under use limitations such as these these commitments which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time such as 15 or 20 years may limit our ability to raise rents aggressively and in consequence can also limit increases in the value of the communities subject to these restrictions 

in addition some of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon 

risks related to indebtedness 

we have a 500000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and wachovia bank na serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial banks and bank of america serving as bank and administrative agent the credit facility prohibits us from paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95 of our funds from operations provided that we may pay dividends in excess of 95 of our funds from operations as required to maintain our qualification as a reit our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt our unsecured credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions requirements and other 

  limitations as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility a default in these requirements if uncured could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders 

a decrease in rental revenue could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and our ability to maintain our status as a reit significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms if we issue additional equity securities the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit flexibility 

federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale if we are found to have held acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders in addition real estate in our markets can at times be hard to sell especially if market conditions are poor these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

acquisitions may not yield anticipated results 

subject to the requirements related to the fund discussed below we may in the future acquire apartment communities on a select basis our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks 

 

failure to succeed in new markets or in activities other than the development ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences 

we may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise as noted in the business description above we also own and operate retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space as is often the case with large urban infill developments also as noted in the business description above we expect to develop directly or through a joint venture partnership one or more parcels with the intent to sell which we believe represents the best use for those parcels our historical experience in our existing markets in developing owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets should we choose to enter them or that we will be successful in these other activities we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets including an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities an inability to hire and retain key personnel and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures we may be unsuccessful in owning and operating retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell 

  risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures 

instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly at times we invest as a partner or a coventurer partnership or joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests frequently we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

risks associated with our discretionary investment fund  

we have formed the fund which through a whollyowned subsidiary we manage as the general partner and to which we have committed 50000000 representing a 152 equity interest this presents risks including the following 

 

risk of earthquake damage 

as further described in item 2 “communities — insurance and risk of uninsured losses” many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

a significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above we carry commercial general liability insurance property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also 

  continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur costs and increased expenses to repair property damage resulting from inclement weather 

particularly in the northeast and midwest we are exposed to risks associated with inclement winter weather including increased costs for the removal of snow and ice as well as from delays in construction in addition inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance and repair of our communities 

we may incur costs due to environmental contamination 

under various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances we may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property or personal injury damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property 

in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose liability for release of acms and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of several of the communities that we acquired we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which acms are detected we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities 

we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities 

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operation in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have 

  established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 

additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 

we cannot assure you that 

 

failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax in addition unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders thus our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a reit or that we will remain qualified in the future this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 

even if we qualify as a reit we will be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders in addition we may engage in activities through taxable subsidiaries and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income of those subsidiaries 

  the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by maryland law 

there are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests these provisions include the following 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50000000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights including voting rights of any series of preferred stock issued the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control 

to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year to maintain this qualification and to otherwise address concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock our charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code or beneficially as defined in section 13 of the securities exchange act by any single stockholder of more than 98 of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock in general under our charter pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock under our charter our board of directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons these ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

our bylaws provide that the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast in the election of directors is required to elect a director in a contested election if no nominee receives the vote of holders of a majority of all of the shares entitled to be cast the incumbent directors would remain in office this requirement may prevent or delay a change in control and as a result could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock 

as a maryland corporation we are subject to the provisions of the maryland general corporation law maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers even if they are in our stockholders’ best interests in addition other provisions of the maryland general corporation law permit the board of directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval such as classifying our board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually that if made or taken could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control

  item 2 communities 

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category 

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes 

 

development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating 

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable 

in addition we own approximately 60000 square feet of office space in alexandria virginia for our corporate office with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases 

  as of december 31 2005 our communities were classified as follows 

 

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 

current communities 

our current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings in january 2006 we disposed of two communities containing an aggregate of 473 apartment homes the current communities as of january 31 2006 include 106 gardenstyle of which 14 are mixed communities and include townhomes 20 highrise and 15 midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following 

 

 

 

we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and where vacant available for immediate occupancy we believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific 

  needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 

our current communities are located in the following geographic markets 

 

we manage and operate all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2005 we completed construction of 1971 apartment homes in seven communities acquired 604 apartment homes in four communities and sold 1305 apartment homes in seven communities the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 138 years when adjusted to accommodate for redevelopment activity the average age of our current communities is 86 years 

of the current communities as of january 31 2006 we own 

 

  we also hold a fee simple ownership interest in 14 of the development communities one of which will be subject to a joint venture ownership structure upon construction completion in addition to a membership interest in one limited liability company that owns a development community which is subject to a land lease expiring in december 2103 

in each of our five partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount each downreit partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the applicable partnership agreement the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of january 31 2006 there were 235665 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

  development communities 

as of december 31 2005 we had 15 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 4062 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 1025200000 you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity 

the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted 

 

 

  redevelopment communities 

as of december 31 2005 we had two communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to complete these communities including the cost of acquisition capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment to be approximately 58800000 of which approximately 10000000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be invested during redevelopment and 48800000 was incurred prior to redevelopment statements regarding the future redevelopment or performance of the redevelopment communities are forwardlooking statements we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity 

the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities 

 

 

development rights 

as of december 31 2005 we are evaluating the future development of 47 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold a purchase option we generally hold development rights through options to acquire land although for 17 of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 12495 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2005 there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 31467000 relating to development rights that we consider probable for future development in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 188414000 are reflected as land held for development as of december 31 2005 on the consolidated balance sheet of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report 

  the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes deeming future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense 

you should carefully review section 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development rights 

the table on the following page presents a summary of the 47 development rights we are currently pursuing 

   

 

  recent developments 

sales of existing communities we seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barriertoentry markets where we believe we can 

 

to achieve this increased concentration we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction we sold nine communities containing an aggregate of 1778 apartment homes during the period from january 1 2005 through january 31 2006 net proceeds from the sale of these assets were 464546000 

  land acquisitions  we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2005 we acquired 15 land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of 119719000 the land parcels purchased which are currently held for future development are as follows 

 

 

insurance and risk of uninsured losses 

we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical you should carefully review item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss 

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults a large concentration of our communities lie near and thus are susceptible to the major fault lines in california including 

  the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels we have in place with respect to communities located in california for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building the five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of 100000 per occurrence earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a 200000000 limit except with respect to the state of washington for which the limit is 65000000 our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence in addition up to a policy aggregate of 3000000 the next 400000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible 

our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was renewed on august 1 2005 and the insurance coverage provided for in these renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year including the costs we estimate that we may incur as a result of deductibles we expect the cost related to these insurance categories for the policy period from august 1 2005 to july 31 2006 to decrease 5 to 7 as compared to the prior period 

in an effort to capitalize on declining insurance rates we elected to extend the first 15000000 layer of the property insurance policy by five months thereby changing the renewal date for this layer to may 1 2006 the remaining layers renewed on december 1 2005 we are currently in negotiations with all carriers to align the renewal dates the costs associated with the excess property insurance layers including the cost we estimate we may incur as a result of deductibles increased by approximately 12 

just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in december 2005 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance extension act “triea” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 200000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under triea such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides triea coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities triea is scheduled to expire on december 31 2007 it is uncertain if congress will extend this act and continue to provide federal support for terrorism insurance if congress does not extend triea the cost and availability of terrorism insurance may be in question 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present however we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities we cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend 

we are currently involved in litigation alleging that communities constructed by us violate the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act the lawsuit equal rights center v avalonbay communities inc was filed on september 23 2005 in the federal district court in maryland the plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts as well as injunctive relief such as 

  modification of existing assets an award of attorneys’ fees expenses and costs of suit the company has filed a motion to dismiss all or parts of the suit which has not been ruled on yet by the court due to the preliminary nature of the litigation we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this lawsuit nor is it reasonably possible to estimate the amount of loss if any that would be associated with an adverse decision or settlement 

we are currently involved in a lawsuit regarding the handling of security deposits in california the lawsuit julie e ko v avalonbay communities inc and does 1 through 100 was filed on june 6 2003 in california’s los angeles superior court the suit purports to be brought on behalf of all of the company’s former california residents who during a fouryear period paid a security deposit to the company for the rental of residential property in california and allegedly had a portion of the deposit withheld by the company in excess of the damages actually sustained by the company we have agreed with the plaintiff on the terms of a settlement with the purported class the settlement terms have been approved by the court subject to final certification and approval after administration of the settlement which is expected in april 2006 the company has accrued for the costs it expects to incur in connection with the settlement although there can be no assurance that the final settlement cost which depends on the number of claims properly submitted will not exceed the company’s estimate 

we are involved in litigation with york hunter construction inc and national union fire insurance company related to a community that has since completed development a nonjury trial in the supreme court of the state of new york county of westchester ended in april 2004 and in may 2004 the court issued a ruling finding that i york hunter breached the construction management agreement between it and the company in failing to complete the project and abandoning the construction site and is therefore liable to the company for consequential damages and ii national union having failed to exercise its various rights to perform and complete is liable to the company for consequential damages the court issued a ruling dated october 6 2004 awarding the company approximately 1250000 plus interest the company has filed an appeal to seek an increase in the damage award

we are involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given we do not believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

we are primarily engaged in developing acquiring owning and operating apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy and when pricing is attractive 

the net operating income of our current operating communities as defined later in this report is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

this report including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events or trends as described more fully under “forwardlooking statements” on page 61 of this report actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in item 1a “risk factors” of this report the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 

business description and community information overview 

we believe that apartment communities present an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new rental household formations are expected to outpace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle barrierstoentry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 

we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 

we believe that over an entire real estate cycle lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flow relative to other markets however throughout the real estate cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003 particularly in the technology telecom and financial services sectors this resulted in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates and demand however 2004 was a year of transition where the economy showed signs of an early phase recovery as evidenced by modest job growth and declining unemployment claims the improvement in the economic environment in 2005 has resulted in stronger apartment market fundamentals 

  this is supported by the following operating results achieved within our established community portfolio during 2005 

 

based on these results and our expectations for improving demandsupply fundamentals we expect continued growth in the revenue and net operating income generated by our operating communities in 2006 we expect continued job growth and household formation in our markets in 2006 the principal drivers of housing demand condominium conversion activity has reduced the availability of rental apartments while low singlefamily home affordability makes rental apartments an economically attractive housing alternative accordingly we expect apartment market fundamentals to continue to improve in our markets such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply resulting in rental revenue growth of 50 to 60 in our established community portfolio in 2006 and projected noi growth of 60 to 70 

in positioning for future growth we increased our development volume we currently have in excess of 1000000000 under construction measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion including the portions owned by joint venture partners in addition we continue to secure new development rights as discussed below including the acquisition of land for future development we currently have development rights for construction of new apartment communities that based on total projected capitalized cost total approximately 3000000000 we anticipate starting new developments with total projected capitalized costs of 700000000 to 800000000 in 2006 these total projected capitalized costs may be impacted by increasing construction costs particularly in the areas of payroll utilities concrete and steel we also anticipate acquiring additional land held for future development for an aggregate purchase price of 75000000 to 100000000 

we continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund the “fund” during its investment period which will end on or before march 16 2008 the fund will be our exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities subject to certain exceptions the fund acquired four communities for an aggregate purchase price of 99907000 during 2005 and has approximately 90000000 under contract for acquisition in early 2006 we will continue to focus on acquisition opportunities where we believe we can create value generally through redevelopment or repositioning opportunities 

strong capital flows to the industry and the strength of the condominium market have resulted in an attractive selling environment we sold seven communities during 2005 for an aggregate sales price of approximately 350000000 of which approximately 315000000 was sold to condominium converters we anticipate asset sales of approximately 225000000 to 300000000 in 2006 

while the active condominium market has created demand for multifamily apartment communities it has also created a challenging environment for us in other ways such as 

 

there are indications that condominium conversion activity is slowing which could impact the market for our assets held for sale and as a result the volume of assets we offer for sale 

  our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights ie land or land options held for development as further described in item 2 of this report our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities for which detailed discussions can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” 

as of december 31 2005 we owned or held an ownership interest in 158 apartment communities containing 45474 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which 15 communities were under construction and two communities were under reconstruction in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 47 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 12495 apartment homes 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different estimates or assumptions had been made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain as a reit that owns operates and develops apartment communities our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition cost capitalization asset impairment evaluation and reit status a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and statement of financial accounting standards no 13 “accounting for leases” in accordance with our standard lease terms rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease which is generally one year a discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for established communities can be found in “results of operations” 

  cost capitalization 

we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when development efforts commence until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken outofservice for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes making future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense 

we generally capitalize only nonrecurring expenditures we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 15000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident under this policy virtually all capitalized costs are nonrecurring as recurring makeready costs are expensed as incurred recurring makeready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements ii floor coverings iii interior painting and iv other redecorating costs because we expense recurring makeready costs such as carpet replacements our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover we capitalize purchases of personal property such as computers and furniture only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds 2500 we generally expense replacements of personal property 

in 2005 2004 and 2003 the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions development and redevelopment were 425170000 347091000 and 296764000 respectively for established and other stabilized communities we recorded nonrevenue generating capital expenditures of 16753000 or 471 per apartment home in 2005 12347000 or 354 per apartment home in 2004 and 11064000 or 333 per apartment home in 2003 in addition revenue generating capital expenditures such as water submetering equipment and cable installations were 817000 637000 and 529000 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home including carpet and appliance replacements related to these communities was 1546 in 2005 1348 in 2004 and 1262 in 2003 historically we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased and expensed maintenance costs have fluctuated with turnover although we expect these trends to continue in the future capitalized costs increased in 2005 over prior year growth levels as we embarked on a number of community upgrades and improvements we expect capitalized costs in 2006 to be at or slightly above 2005 levels as we continue with these community upgrades and improvements 

asset impairment evaluation 

if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining useful life on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the community if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flow of the community we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell 

  we account for our investments in unconsolidated entities that were created prior to and have not been modified since june 29 2005 and are not variable interest entities in accordance with statement of position 789 “accounting for investments in real estate ventures” and accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” any investments in entities that were created or modified subsequent to june 29 2005 and are not variable interest entities are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value a loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 

  results of operations 

our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market disposition and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for the years 2005 2004 and 2003 follows dollars in thousands 

 

net income available to common stockholders increased 102633000 or 486 to 313678000 in 2005 this increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of assets in 2005 including the gain related to the sale of a technology investment as well as increased net operating income from established communities and newly developed communities net income available to common stockholders decreased 49736000 or 191 to 211045000 in 2004 this decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales in 2004 as compared to 2003 including the gain realized from an unconsolidated entity and increased depreciation expense partially offset by increased net operating income from newly developed and acquired communities 

net operating income “noi” is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and noi excludes 

 

   

noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a calculation of noi for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 along with a reconciliation to net income for each year is as follows dollars in thousands 

 

the noi increases of 40807000 and 35783000 in 2005 and 2004 respectively as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands 

 

 

  the noi increase in established communities in 2005 was largely due to the improved apartment market fundamentals we maintained average economic occupancy of at least 95 in all regions during the year ended december 31 2005 and we experienced the first yearoveryear increase in rental rates in three years we reached a transition point in the components of rental revenue growth shifting from occupancy gains to increases in rental rates we will continue to seek increases in rental rates by increasing market rents andor reducing concessions and we expect revenue growth from our established communities of 50 to 60 in 2006 as compared to 2005 in addition although we will continue to aggressively manage operating expenses there is upward pressure on operating expenses from increasing utility labor and property tax expenses we expect operating expenses at our established communities to increase by 30 to 40 in 2006 as compared to 2005 overall we anticipate growth in noi from our established communities of 60 to 70 in 2006 as compared to 2005 

the company has given projected noi growth in 2006 only for established communities and not on a companywide basis the company believes that noi growth of the established communities assists investors in understanding management’s estimate of the likely contribution to operations from established communities however the company has not provided a projection of noi growth on a companywide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts dispositions and acquisitions as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporatelevel property management overhead general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed disposed or acquired noi growth expected from established communities is not a projection of the company’s projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow 

rental and other income increased in 2005 due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities rental and other income increased in 2004 due to rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities as well as increased occupancy for our established communities partially offset by declines in effective rental rates for our established communities we expect apartment fundamentals to continue to strengthen in 2006 

overall portfolio — the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 36520 apartment homes for 2005 as compared to 34540 apartment homes for 2004 and 30774 apartment homes for 2003 this change is primarily the result of an increase in the overall occupancy rate and increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities partially offset by communities sold in 2005 and 2004 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to 1516 in 2005 as compared to 1477 in 2004 and 1505 in 2003 

established communities — rental revenue increased 16523000 or 36 in 2005 and decreased 1496000 or 03 in 2004 the increase in 2005 is due to both increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy as compared to 2004 the decrease in 2004 is due to declining rental rates partially offset by increased economic occupancy as compared to 2003 for 2005 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 27 to 1503 compared to 1464 in 2004 primarily due to increased market rents and decreased concessions the average economic occupancy increased from 952 in 2004 to 961 in 2005 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents we expect rental revenue from established communities to increase 50 to 60 in 2006 as compared to 2005 

we experienced increases in established communities’ rental revenue in all six of our regions in 2005 as compared to 2004 the largest increases in rental revenue were in southern california the pacific northwest and the northeast with increases of 57 43 and 37 respectively between years the northeast and northern california regions comprise the majority of our established community revenue and therefore are discussed in more detail below 

  the northeast region represented approximately 355 of established community rental revenue during 2005 average rental rates increased 22 to 1892 in 2005 and economic occupancy increased 15 during 2005 we expect job growth to improve in the northeast in 2006 although at a more moderate rate than our other markets we expect moderate rental rate growth in the northeast during 2006 with northern new jersey leading the region in revenue growth we expect boston massachusetts to lag the region in revenue growth as economic recovery is not occurring as quickly as in other areas of the region 

northern california which represented approximately 310 in established community rental revenue during 2005 experienced an increase in rental revenue of 28 in 2005 as compared to 2004 average rental rates increased by 21 to 1448 in 2005 and economic occupancy increased 07 to 962 in 2005 although apartment fundamentals have been weak in certain areas of northern california particularly in san jose california 2005 was a transition point for the region we expect northern california to see continued improvement in apartment fundamentals driven by accelerating job growth and reduced product in the rental market due to condominium conversion activity we expect the improving fundamentals to translate into accelerated revenue growth 

in accordance with gaap cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term which is generally one year as a supplemental measure we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions as well as current rental market conditions 

the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 dollars in thousands information for the year ended december 31 2003 is not presented as established community classification is not applicable prior to january 1 2004 see note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements 

 

management development and other fees increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increased asset management property management and redevelopment fees earned from the fund which was formed in march 2005 in addition construction and development fees earned from one of our unconsolidated entities in 2005 contributed to increased fee income we expect fee income to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to a full year of operations of and an increased number of assets owned by the fund 

  direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased in both 2005 and 2004 primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes 

for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 965000 or 09 to 104346000 in 2005 due primarily to increases in payroll and utility costs partially offset by decreases in marketing and bad debt expenses during 2004 operating expenses increased 2131000 or 22 due primarily to increased payroll costs as well as increased makeready costs associated with increasing occupancy we expect operating expenses for established communities to increase by 30 to 40 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily as a result of continued higher utility expenses and payroll costs operating expense growth in 2006 as compared to 2005 will be tempered due to 880000 of expenses incurred in 2005 for land lease payments that will not be incurred in 2006 due to the exercise of a purchase option 

property taxes increased in both 2005 and 2004 due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 

for established communities property taxes increased in 2005 and 2004 by 1530000 and 333000 respectively due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years we expect property taxes to continue to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 as local jurisdictions are expected to continue to seek additional revenue sources to offset budget deficits however property taxes may fluctuate due to the timing and size of successful tax appeals we evaluate property tax increases internally as well as engage thirdparty consultants and appeal increases when appropriate 

corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increased compensation costs as well as increased costs relating to corporate initiatives including investments in technology and training we expect corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 as compensation costs continue to increase 

investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions investment management and abandoned pursuit costs which include the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits acquisition pursuits disposition pursuits and technology investments investments and investment management increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased costs incurred in forming and managing the fund partially offset by a decrease in abandoned pursuit costs investments and investment management increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to the costs incurred in preparing for and forming the fund increased compensation costs and increased abandoned pursuit costs we expect investments and investment management costs to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 as fund activity increases abandoned pursuit costs were 816000 1726000 and 1180000 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile and the costs incurred in any given period may be widely different in future years 

interest expense net decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the repayment of unsecured debt and a partial reissuance at lower interest rates as well as higher levels of capitalized interest in connection with our increased development activity partially offset by overall higher shortterm interest rates and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility interest expense net increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the interest income related to a participating mortgage note included in interest expense net in 2003 as described more fully below partially offset by the repayment of unsecured debt and reissuance at lower interest rates overall lower interest rates and lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility we expect interest expense net to decrease during 2006 primarily due to higher levels of capitalized interest resulting from increased development activity as well as lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility 

  depreciation expense increased in both 2005 and 2004 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities 

general and administrative expense “ga” increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of i separation costs of approximately 2100000 due to the departure of a senior executive ii the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately 1500000 iii increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability and iv higher compensation costs ga increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of higher compensation costs increased litigation and settlement costs associated with certain community and corporate matters and additional corporate governance costs including costs relating to compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we expect expensed overhead costs including ga corporate  level property management and investments and investment management to increase from 00 to 50 in 2006 as compared to 2005 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased in 2005 primarily due to the gain recognized in the amount of 6252000 related to the sale of our investment in rentcom to ebay equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to our 50 share of the gain received on a community sold in 2003 which was accounted for under the equity method 

venture partner interest in profitsharing in 2004 and 2003 represented the income allocated to our venture partner in a profitsharing arrangement as discussed in note 6 “investments in unconsolidated entities” of our consolidated financial statements effective december 2004 we no longer account for our interest in this venture as a profitsharing arrangement and therefore during 2005 no income or loss from venture partner interest in profitsharing was recognized 

minority interest in consolidated partnerships increased in 2005 and decreased in 2004 due to the consolidation of an entity under fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” as revised in december 2003 effective january 1 2004 we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note due to the implementation of fin 46 as discussed in note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements we did not hold an equity interest in this entity and therefore 100 of the entity’s net loss was recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships during the year ended december 31 2004 in october 2004 we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity upon repayment of the mortgage note our economic interest in this entity ended and therefore this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under fin 46 and we discontinued consolidation 

income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from january 1 2003 through december 31 2005 or considered held for sale as of december 31 2005 see note 7 “discontinued operations — real estate assets sold or held for sale” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information the decreases in 2005 and 2004 are due to the sale of seven communities and one office building in 2005 and five communities in 2004 eliminating the income generated from these assets upon disposition 

gain on sale of real estate assets increased in 2005 and decreased in 2004 due to the volume and size of dispositions in each year the amount of gains realized depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and local market conditions we expect to continue to sell communities based on overall portfolio allocation needs as well as to respond to market opportunities 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is a result of the implementation of fin 46 discussed above and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under fin 46 and the previously recorded net assets 

dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased during 2004 primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during 2003 

  funds from operations attributable to common stockholders “ffo” 

ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report 

liquidity and capital resources 

factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing source and amount of cash flow provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment particularly to changes in interest rates the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital 

we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flow from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund 

 

we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 6106000 at december 31 2005 an increase of 4585000 from 1521000 at december 31 2004 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 

operating activities — net cash provided by operating activities increased to 306639000 in 2005 from 275617000 in 2004 primarily due to additional noi from our established community operations as well as noi from recently developed communities partially offset by the loss of noi from the 12 communities sold in 2005 and 2004 as discussed earlier in this report 

investing activities — net cash used in investing activities of 19761000 in 2005 related to investments in assets through development redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities including the acquisition of a partner interest in a real estate joint venture substantially all of which is offset by proceeds from asset dispositions including the proceeds from the sale of a technology investment during 2005 we invested 459376000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures 

 

   

financing activities — net cash used in financing activities totaled 282293000 in 2005 consisting primarily of dividends paid certain unsecured note repayments and mortgage note repayments partially offset by the issuance of common stock for option exercises the issuance of unsecured notes and mortgage notes payable including draws on construction loans and an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility see note 3 “notes payable unsecured notes and credit facility” and note 4 “stockholders’ equity” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information

we have a 500000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and wachovia bank na serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial banks and bank of america serving as bank and administrative agent under the terms of the credit facility we may elect to increase the facility by up to an additional 150000000 provided that one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds we pay participating banks in the aggregate an annual facility fee of approximately 750000 the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 055 per annum 512 on january 31 2006 the spread over libor can vary from libor plus 050 to libor plus 115 based upon the rating of our longterm unsecured debt in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 250000000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january 31 2006 we are subject to i certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility including but not limited to maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels and ii prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95 of our ffo except as may be required to maintain our reit status the credit facility matures in may 2008 assuming our exercise of a oneyear renewal option at january 31 2006 16000000 was outstanding 39504000 was used to provide letters of credit and 444496000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 

  future financing and capital needs — debt maturities 

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our longterm liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 

the following debt activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2005 

 

we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission the shelf registration statement originally provided for the issuance of 750000000 of debt and equity in one or more public offerings however only 370984000 remains available for issuance we expect to increase our debt and equity capacity in early 2006 however we cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on costeffective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times

  future financing and capital needs — portfolio and other activity 

as of december 31 2005 we had 15 new communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 598412000 remained to be invested in addition we had two communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 1656000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from 

 

before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to the fund as discussed below or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights writeoff associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 

we have invested in the fund a private discretionary investment vehicle that will acquire and operate apartment communities in our markets the fund will serve until march 16 2008 or until 80 of its committed capital is invested as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire apartment communities subject to certain exceptions these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund if any the fund will not restrict our development activities and will terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions the fund has nine institutional investors including us with combined capital commitments of 330000000 a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors are being made through avalonbay value added fund inc a maryland corporation that will qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the “fund reit” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed 50000000 to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately 11600000 has been invested as of january 31 2006 representing a 152 combined general partner and limited partner equity interest under the fund documents the fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65 on a portfolio basis which if achieved would enable the fund to invest up to 940000000 

from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity we may also use joint ventures related to mixeduse land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement however we can not assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 

in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities in response to real estate and capital markets conditions including strong institutional demand for real estate assets in our markets and demand from condominium converters we sold seven communities with net proceeds in the aggregate of 344185000 in 2005 and expect to sell communities at an aggregate sales price of 225000000 to 300000000 in 2006 we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue 

  to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses noi and ffo as of january 31 2006 we have one community classified as held for sale under gaap we are actively pursuing the disposition of this community and expect to close on this disposition within the next twelve months however we cannot assure you that this community will be sold as planned 

off balance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interests up to 50 four of these unconsolidated real estate entities avalon terrace llc cvp i llc mission bay venture partners llc and the fund have debt outstanding as of december 31 2005 as follows additional discussion of these entities can be found in note 6 “investments in unconsolidated entities” of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

 

in addition as part of the formation of the fund we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee the guarantee provides that if upon final liquidation of the fund the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the fund whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal the total capital contributions made by that partner then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall but in no event more than 10 of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately 1700000 as of december 31 2005 we have not recorded a liability related to this guarantee as of december 31 2005 as the fair value of the real estate assets owned by the fund is considered adequate to cover such payment under a liquidation scenario 

  there are no other lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 

contractual obligations 

we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of longterm debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2005 dollars in thousands 

 

 

inflation and deflation 

substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases 

forwardlooking statements 

this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to 

 

   

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors which we describe in item 1a “risk factors” elsewhere in this report may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements 

in addition these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 

our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates we had 241712000 and 217881000 in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2005 and 2004 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 3990000 and 3682000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 

we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness under swap agreements 

 

as of december 31 2005 the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately 67400000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate taxexempt debt was not electively entered into by us but rather was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our taxexempt bond financings because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider had these swap agreements not been in place during 2005 and 2004 our annual interest costs would have been 

  approximately 1878000 and 2769000 lower respectively based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years additionally if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2005 and 2004 and these swap agreements had not been in place our annual interest costs would have been approximately 1200000 and 2073000 lower respectively 

in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 2300582000 at december 31 2005 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 2426250000 at december 31 2005 fixed rate debt excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented 1981670000 of the carrying value and 2107342000 of the fair value at december 31 2005 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2005 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by 88418000

 item 1 business general avalonbay communities inc is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we focus on the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states this is because we believe that long term the limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states at february 28 2005 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 138 operating apartment communities containing 40142 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which four communities containing 1430 apartment homes were under reconstruction in addition we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in ten communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of 2668 apartment homes when completed we also owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in rights to develop an additional 49 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 13491 apartment homes we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community in selecting sites for development redevelopment or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value by successfully and costeffectively developing redeveloping acquiring owning and operating highquality communities in our selected markets that contain features and amenities desired by residents as well as by providing our residents with efficient and effective service to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets with growing or high potential for demand iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such that we maintain continuous access to costeffective capital our longterm strategy is to deeply penetrate the high barriertoentry markets in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 1 

  during the three years ended december 31 2004 we acquired seven apartment communities disposed of 17 apartment communities and completed the development of 24 apartment communities and the redevelopment of three apartment communities in anticipation of continued improvement in apartment fundamentals and stronger apartment demand we have increased our development and acquisition volume during 2004 we increased our level of acquisition activity in preparation of the closing of a discretionary investment fund in addition we continued to secure new development opportunities bringing our pipeline for potential development opportunities to a new high however we continued with certain disposition activity when presented with opportunities to realize value in 2005 we expect to continue acquisitions for the discretionary investment fund particularly potential redevelopment communities and to continue to be an opportunistic seller while increasing our development activity over 2004 levels the level of development acquisition and disposition activity however is heavily influenced by capital market conditions including prevailing interest rates a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition and acquisition strategy follows development strategy we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive offices in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following cities  after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks as well as preserves capital after we acquire land we generally shift our focus to construction however we will acquire and hold land where business conditions warrant except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers we act as our own general contractor and construction manager we generally perform these functions directly and not through a subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure highquality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operational phase throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to generally renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is significantly below replacement cost and the community is one of the highest quality apartment communities or best rental values for an apartment community in its local area we have established procedures to minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure highquality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phase 2 

  throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle disposition strategy we sell assets when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle as well as provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target from time to time in order to achieve rapid penetration into markets that are generally supply constrained and in which we desire an increased presence and to help us achieve our desired product mix or to rebalance our portfolio we will acquire existing apartment communities over the next several years we expect to increase our acquisition activity for a discretionary investment fund which we anticipate closing in early 2005 particularly potential redevelopment opportunities property management strategy  we intend to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities and controlled operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include  controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we control operating expenses as follows  onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income produced at their respective communities we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly and not through a subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we are also pursuing ancillary services which could provide additional revenue sources in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” and is therefore subject to federal income taxes we have used taxable reit subsidiaries on a limited basis such as to receive a commission from a “preferred provider” vendor used by residents 3 

  technology strategy we believe that an innovative management information system infrastructure is an important element in managing our future growth this is because timely and accurate collection of financial and resident profile data will enable us to maximize revenue through careful leasing decisions and financial management financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to maintain a capital structure that is aligned to the business risks presented by our corporate strategy at december 31 2004 our debttototal market capitalization was 304 and our longterm floating rate debt not including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility was 26 of total market capitalization total market capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of our common stock the market value of our operating partnership units outstanding based on the market value of our common stock the liquidation preference of our preferred stock and the outstanding principal amount of our debt we believe that debttototal market capitalization can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company’s longterm liquidity and balance sheet strength because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the company’s common stock trades however because debttototal market capitalization changes with fluctuations in our stock price which occurs regularly our debttototal market capitalization may change even when our earnings and debt levels remain stable we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash and borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility if required to meet the balance of our current or anticipated liquidity needs we will attempt to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility sell existing communities or land andor issue additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and long term liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report while we believe we have the financial position to expand our shortterm credit capacity and access the capital markets as needed we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements sales or offerings the failure to complete these transactions on a costeffective basis or at all could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint venture or partnership our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community who may prefer that or who may require less payment if the land or community is contributed to a joint venture or partnership ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle is used investments in joint ventures or partnerships are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement we have engaged in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities this fund would serve for a period of three years from its initial closing date or until 80 of its committed capital is invested as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities subject to certain exceptions these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund if any the fund would not restrict our development activities and would terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions as of february 28 2005 we have acquired four communities with the intent of being owned by the fund but which are currently consolidated and included in our operating results we are currently targeting acquisitions for the fund where value 4 

  creation opportunities are present through one or more of the following redevelopment activities market cycle opportunities or improved property operations we expect the fund to have equity commitments of up to 330000000 and the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65 on a portfolio basis which would enable the fund to invest up to 940000000 we would contribute 20 of the total equity up to 50000000 we expect closing on the equity funding during the first quarter of 2005 there can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or if formed what its size terms or investment performance will be the use of joint ventures and the discretionary investment fund described above creates risks for us for example an investor or coventurer could have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business and goals could fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required or could fail to approve decisions we advise for which their approval may be required such as the timing of a sale of a property in addition when entering into a joint venture or the discretionary investment fund we undertake fiduciary duties and reporting and other obligations to coventurers in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property while we emphasize equity real estate investments in apartment communities we have the ability which would be exercised in the discretion of our board of directors to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit on occasion we own and operate retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2004 we had a total of 331384 square feet of rentable retail space that produced gross rental revenue in 2004 of 3383000 05 of total revenue any investment in securities of other entities is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code or the treasury regulations the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit inflation and deflation substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases combined with relatively consistent demand have allowed rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive inflation hedge however in a deflationary rent environment as experienced over the last several years we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases tax matters we filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level while we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 5 

  competition we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other apartment reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value proposition given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete with the condominium and singlefamily home markets although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition environmental and related matters under various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by these parties as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of reconstruction remodeling renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose liability for release of acms and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of several of the communities that we acquired we have implemented an operations and maintenance program for each of the communities at which acms have been detected we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present however we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities 6 

  additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties and have sold communities that we owned and operated to third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties we cannot assure you that  other information our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 are available free of charge in the “investor relations” section of our website wwwavalonbaycom as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the sec in addition the charters of our board’s nominating and corporate governance committee audit committee and compensation committee as well as the company’s corporate governance guidelines are available free of charge in that section of our website or by writing to avalonbay communities inc 2900 eisenhower avenue suite 300 alexandria virginia 22314 attention chief financial officer we were incorporated under the laws of the state of california in 1978 in 1995 we reincorporated in the state of maryland and have been focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time as of december 31 2004 we had 1702 employees item 2 communities our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes  7 

   development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable in addition we own an aggregate of approximately 77000 square feet of office space in alexandria virginia and new canaan connecticut for our corporate office and a regional office with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases 8 

  as of december 31 2004 our communities were classified as follows  

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages current communities our current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings the current communities as of february 28 2005 include 105 gardenstyle of which 12 are mixed communities and include townhomes 19 highrise and 14 midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following  other features at various communities may include  9 

  we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and where vacant available for immediate occupancy we believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses our current communities are located in the following geographic markets  

we manage and operate all of our current communities during the year ended december 31 2004 we completed construction of 2135 apartment homes in seven communities acquired 1165 apartment homes in five communities and sold 1360 apartment homes in five communities in addition we received payment in full for our interest in a senior participating mortgage loan secured by a 302 apartment home community the average age of our current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 85 years of the current communities as of february 28 2005 we own  10 

  we also hold a fee simple ownership interest in nine of the development communities two of which will be subject to joint venture ownership structures upon construction completion in addition to a membership interest in a limited liability company that owns one development community subject to a land lease which expires in december 2026 in each of our five partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount each downreit partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the applicable partnership agreement the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of february 28 2005 there were 494071 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 11

  development communities as of december 31 2004 we had ten development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 2668 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 546700000 statements regarding the future development or performance of the development communities are forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that  you should carefully review the discussion under “risks of development and redevelopment” included elsewhere in this item 2 25 

  the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted  

 26 

   redevelopment communities as of december 31 2004 we had four communities under redevelopment we expect the total capitalized cost to complete these communities including the cost of acquisition capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment to be approximately 229300000 of which approximately 40300000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be invested during redevelopment and 189000000 was incurred prior to redevelopment statements regarding the future redevelopment or performance of the redevelopment communities are forwardlooking statements we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate see the discussion under “risks of development and redevelopment” included elsewhere in this report the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities  

 development rights as of december 31 2004 we are evaluating the future development of 49 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold a purchase option we generally hold development rights through options to acquire land although for fifteen of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 13491 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2004 there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 37007000 relating to development rights that we consider probable for future development in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 166751000 are reflected as land held for development on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2004 27 

  the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to invest in if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes deeming future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense although the development of any particular development right cannot be assured we believe that the development rights in the aggregate present attractive potential opportunities for future development and growth of longterm stockholder value statements regarding the future development of the development rights are forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that  the table on the following page presents a summary of the 49 development rights we are currently pursuing 28

   risks of development and redevelopment we intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment home communities our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed to the following  the occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect results of operations and our payment of distributions to our stockholders construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in the community’s market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes to those market conditions that we anticipated at that time although we attempt to anticipate changes in market conditions we cannot predict those changes with certainty construction costs have been increasing particularly for materials such as steel concrete and lumber and for some of our development communities and development rights the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget we do not expect that these price increases will materially affect our current development communities however these increases may materially affect development rights where construction has not yet begun total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective development or redevelopment community determined in accordance with gaap including  costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 30 

  recent developments sales of existing communities we seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barriertoentry markets where we believe we can  to achieve this increased concentration we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction we sold five communities containing a total of 1360 apartment homes during the period from january 1 2004 through february 28 2005 net proceeds from the sale of these assets were 210001000 land acquisitions  we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2004 we acquired ten land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of 122775000 the land parcels purchased which are currently held for future development are as follows

   insurance and risk of uninsured losses we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a thirdparty were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that thirdparty a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults a large concentration of our communities lie near and thus are susceptible to the major fault lines in california including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in june 2004 we renewed our earthquake insurance we have in place with respect to communities located in california for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building the five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of 100000 per occurrence earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a 200000000 limit except with respect to the state of washington for which the limit is 65000000 our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence in addition up to a policy aggregate of 3000000 the next 400000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was renewed on august 1 2004 and the insurance coverage provided for in these renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year including the costs we estimate that we may incur as a result of deductibles we expect the cost related to these insurance categories for the policy period from august 1 2004 to july 31 2005 to remain flat as compared to the prior period our property insurance policy was scheduled to renew on december 1 2005 however in an effort to capitalize on declining insurance rates we elected to extend the first 15000000 layer of the policy by five months thereby changing the renewal date for this layer to may 1 2006 the remaining layers are currently scheduled to renew on december 1 2005 we are currently in negotiations with all carriers to align the renewal dates based on this policy extension we have seen a decline in insurance premiums for property coverage which combined with the cost we may incur as a result of deductibles we expect will result in declining overall insurance costs as compared to prior periods just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in november 2002 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act “tria” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 200000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tria such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tria coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present however we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation 32 

  program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities we cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities we may elect to purchase insurance separate from our corporate or portfolio insurance policies for certain communities common insurance policies purchased are builder’s risk policies and owner controlled insurance policies “ocip” that cover workers compensation and general liability risks for us and our enrolled contractors in march 2005 we will renew our directors and officers “do” insurance we have met with several carriers in anticipation of this renewal new carriers have entered the insurance market increasing competition and the capital capacity of existing carriers has expanded resulting in a partial reversal of the significant premium increases experienced in recent years however the number and severity of recent and pending do claims may result in premium increases for this renewal americans with disabilities act the apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” andor “commercial facilities” as defined by the americans with disabilities act compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable the americans with disabilities act does not however consider residential properties such as apartment communities to be public accommodations or commercial facilities except to the extent portions of such facilities such as leasing offices are open to the public we believe our properties comply in all material respects with all present requirements under the americans with disabilities act and applicable state laws noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 











 item 3 legal proceedings as reported most recently in our form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2004 we are currently involved in litigation with york hunter construction inc and national fire insurance company a nonjury trial ended in april 2004 and on may 20 2004 the court issued a ruling finding that i york hunter breached the construction management agreement between it and the company in failing to complete the project and abandoning the construction site and is therefore liable to the company for consequential damages and ii national union having failed to exercise its various rights to perform and complete is liable to the company for consequential damages the court issued a ruling dated october 6 2004 awarding the company approximately 1250000 plus interest the company has determined that it will file an appeal to seek an increase in the damage award also as reported in our form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2004 on june 6 2003 a purported california class action lawsuit julie e ko v avalonbay communities inc and does 1 through 100  was filed against the company in california’s los angeles county superior court the suit purports to be brought on behalf of all of the company’s former california residents who during the fouryear period prior to the filing of the suit paid a security deposit to the company for the rental of residential property in california and had a portion of the deposit withheld by the company allegedly in excess of the damages actually sustained by the company the plaintiff seeks compensatory and statutory damages in unspecified amounts as well as injunctive relief restitution and an award of attorneys’ fees expenses and costs of suit the complaint seeking class certification was amended in march 2004 and the company responded to the amended complaint on may 3 2004 due to the uncertainty of many critical factual and legal issues including the viability of the case as a class action it is not possible to determine or predict the outcome we are involved in various other claims andor administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business while no assurances can be given the company does not believe that any of these outstanding litigation matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company

we expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends however dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time in february 2005 we announced that our board of directors declared a dividend on our common stock for the first quarter of 2005 of 071 per share a 14 increase over the previous quarterly dividend of 070 per share the increased dividend is payable on april 15 2005 to all common stockholders of record as of april 1 2005 during the three months ended december 31 2004 we issued 35500 shares of common stock in exchange for 35500 units of limited partnership held by certain limited partners of avalon downreit v lp and bay pacific northwest lp these shares were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under section 42 of the securities act of 1933 we are relying on the exemption based on factual representations received from the limited partners who received these shares information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in the section entitled “security ownership of certain beneficial owners and managers and related stockholder matters” on page 58 of this form 10k 34 

  


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we focus on the investment in and ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states as of february 28 2005 we had 138 current operating communities which are the primary contributors to our overall operating performance the net operating income of these communities which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities we seek to create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets operating apartment communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy and when pricing is attractive this report including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that predict or indicate future events or trends and that do not report historical matters actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page 54 of this report the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report business description and community information overview we believe that apartment communities present an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new rental household formations are expected to outpace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle barrierstoentry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets which are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states our strategy is to deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our communities are upscale which generally command among the highest rents in their markets however we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services we believe that over an entire business cycle lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flow relative to other markets however throughout the business cycle apartment market fundamentals and therefore operating cash flows are affected by overall economic conditions a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003 particularly in the technology telecom and financial services sectors this resulted in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates and demand however 2004 was a year of transition where the economy showed signs of an early phase recovery as evidenced by modest job growth and declining unemployment claims the improvement in the economic environment has resulted in more stabilized apartment market fundamentals as reflected in the following operating results achieved within our established community portfolio specifically during the last three months of 2004  38 

   based on these results we believe that 2005 will be a year of continued growth we expect that with continued job growth in our markets apartment market fundamentals the demandsupply balance will continue to improve such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply by a ratio of almost two to one the improvement may not be experienced evenly throughout our markets but is nevertheless expected to result in overall revenue growth for our established community portfolio in 2005 in anticipation of continued improvement in apartment fundamentals and stronger apartment demand we have increased our development and acquisition volume during 2004 we increased our level of acquisition activity in preparation of the closing of a discretionary investment fund in addition we continued to secure new development rights as discussed below bringing our pipeline for potential development opportunities to a new high however we continued to dispose of communities in 2004 in response to opportunities to realize value in 2005 we expect to continue acquisitions for the discretionary investment fund particularly potential redevelopment opportunities and to continue to be an opportunistic seller while increasing our development activity over 2004 levels our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights ie land or land options held for development as further described in item 2 of this report our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities for which detailed discussions can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” as of december 31 2004 we owned or held an ownership interest in 148 apartment communities containing 42810 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which ten communities were under construction and four communities were under reconstruction in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 49 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 13491 apartment homes critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different estimates or assumptions had been made it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we 39 

  consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain as a reit that owns operates and develops apartment communities our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition cost capitalization asset impairment evaluation and reit status a discussion of all of our accounting policies including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and statement of financial accounting standards no 13 “accounting for leases” in accordance with our standard lease terms rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease which is generally one year a discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for established communities can be found in “results of operations” cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when active development commences until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken outofservice for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident rental income and operating costs incurred during the initial leaseup or postredevelopment leaseup period are fully recognized as they accrue we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes deeming future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense we generally capitalize only nonrecurring expenditures we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 15000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident under this policy virtually all capitalized costs are nonrecurring as recurring makeready costs are expensed as incurred recurring makeready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements ii floor coverings iii interior painting and iv other redecorating costs because we expense recurring makeready costs such as carpet replacements our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover we capitalize purchases of personal property such as computers and furniture only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds 2500 we generally expense replacements of personal property in 2004 2003 and 2002 the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions development and redevelopment were 347091000 296764000 and 457851000 respectively for established and other stabilized communities we recorded nonrevenue generating capital expenditures of 12347000 or 354 per apartment home in 2004 11064000 or 333 per apartment home in 2003 and 10214000 or 302 per apartment home in 2002 in addition revenue generating capital expenditures such as water submetering equipment and cable installations were 637000 529000 and 697000 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home including carpet and appliance replacements related to these communities was 1348 in 2004 1262 in 2003 and 1224 in 2002 historically we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed 40 

  maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased and expensed maintenance costs have fluctuated with turnover we expect these trends to continue with capitalized costs increasing in 2005 over prior year levels as we embark on a number of community upgrades and improvements asset impairment evaluation if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining useful life on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the community if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flow of the community we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell we account for our investments in unconsolidated entities that are not variable interest entities in accordance with statement of position 789 “accounting for investments in real estate ventures” and accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value a loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a real estate investment trust or reit we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 41 

  results of operations our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market disposition and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for the years 2004 2003 and 2002 follows dollars in thousands  

net income available to common stockholders decreased 49736000 or 191 to 211045000 in 2004 this decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales as a result of reduced disposition activity from the historically high levels experienced in 2003 partially offset by increased net operating income from newly developed and acquired communities net income available to common stockholders increased 105059000 or 675 to 260781000 in 2003 this increase is primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities due to increased disposition activity including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities and the absence of impairment losses in 2003 partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expense net operating income “noi” is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 42 

  noi is defined by us as total revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excludes  noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a calculation of noi for 2004 2003 and 2002 along with a reconciliation to net income for each year is provided in the preceding table the noi increase of 35313000 in 2004 and decrease of 583000 in 2003 as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands  

 the noi decreases in established communities were largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in our markets during 2003 and the first half of 2004 the impact of historical job losses in many of our markets in addition to strong singlefamily home sales aggravated a weak demand environment which caused market rental rates to decline however 2004 was a year of transition where modest job growth and declining unemployment claims reflected the early stages of an economic recovery strengthening apartment fundamentals along with strong onsite execution resulted in yearoveryear increases in noi during the latter half of 2004 as evidenced in the diminishing decline in noi in 2004 as compared to 2003 based on economic forecasts that project an acceleration in job growth in our markets in 2005 as compared to the modest job growth experienced in 2004 we expect an improved demandsupply ratio in 2005 our occupancy has reached stabilized levels and we began to increase rental rates and reduce concessions in the latter half of 2004 in 2005 we expect the positive momentum from 2004 to continue resulting in growth in revenue from our established communities of 20 to 40 in 2005 as compared to 2004 we aggressively manage operating expenses which we expect to increase by 15 to 35 in 2005 resulting in noi growth for our established community portfolio of 25 to 45 in 2005 as compared to 2004 rental and other income increased in both 2004 and 2003 due to rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities as well as increased occupancy for our established communities partially offset by declines in effective rental rates for our established communities we expect continued improvement in apartment fundamentals due largely to the job growth projected for 2005 43 

  overall portfolio — the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 36431 apartment homes for 2004 as compared to 32629 apartment homes for 2003 and 30437 in 2002 this change is primarily the result of increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities and an increase in the overall occupancy rate partially offset by communities sold in 2003 and 2004 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to 1479 in 2004 as compared to 1508 in 2003 and 1539 in 2002 primarily due to the poor demandsupply fundamentals in our markets that resulted in a high concessionary environment in certain of our markets established communities — rental revenue decreased 1496000 or 03 in 2004 and 20424000 or 43 in 2003 these decreases are due to declining rental rates partially offset by increased economic occupancy as compared to the prior years for 2004 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased 18 to 1418 compared to 1444 in 2003 partially due to the impact of increased concessions granted throughout 2003 and into 2004 the average economic occupancy increased from 938 in 2003 to 953 in 2004 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents we expect rental revenue from established communities to increase 20 to 40 in 2005 as compared to 2004 although rental revenue from the established community portfolio as a whole was relatively flat in 2004 as compared to 2003 we had increases in established communities’ rental revenue in four of our six regions the largest increase was in the midatlantic with an increase in rental revenue of 24 between years reflecting an increase in both economic occupancy and average rental rates in addition in southern california we were able to increase average rental rates by 15 while also increasing economic occupancy by 04 resulting in an increase in rental revenue of 19 between years the midwest and pacific northwest experienced increases in rental revenue of 22 and 14 respectively during 2004 as compared to 2003 reflecting increased economic occupancy partially offset by declining average rental rates however our total rental revenue from established communities was impacted by the continued declines in average rental rates in certain northern california and northeast markets northern california which accounted for approximately 311 of established community rental revenue during 2004 experienced a decline in rental revenue of 31 in 2004 as compared to 2003 partially related to the continued impact of job losses experienced in the technology sector in prior years although economic occupancy in northern california increased to an average of 956 in 2004 average rental rates dropped 34 to 1365 from 1413 during 2003 however we began to see signs of improvement in northern california during the last three months of 2004 as average rental rates and economic occupancy both increased sequentially therefore we expect yearoveryear revenue growth in northern california in 2005 the northeast region accounted for approximately 342 of established community rental revenue during 2004 rental revenue remained relatively flat as compared to 2003 as the region entered the early stages of economic recovery from the job losses experienced in the financial services sector in prior years economic occupancy increased by 25 during 2004 while average rental rates dropped 25 to 1800 from 1847 in 2003 the northeast region appears to be stabilizing as reflected in yearoveryear rental revenue growth during the latter half of 2004 although we expect pressure on rental rates to continue in the northeast region we expect yearoveryear revenue growth in the northeast in 2005 but at a lesser pace than other regions in accordance with gaap cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term which is generally one year as a supplemental measure we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as 44 

  reported by other companies rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions as well as current rental market conditions the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 dollars in thousands information for the year ended december 31 2002 is not presented as established community classification is not applicable prior to january 1 2003 see note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements  

concessions granted per movein for established communities averaged 974 during 2004 an increase of 155 from 843 in 2003 concessions granted per movein peaked at 1109 during the three months ended june 30 2004 before subsiding to 861 during the three months ended december 31 2004 the decrease in recent months is expected to continue into 2005 as demandsupply fundamentals improve with job growth and we regain pricing power however because we amortize concessions over the lease term the historically high concessions from 2004 will continue to lower reported operating results in 2005 management development and other fees decreased in both 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to a decrease in the number of communities that we manage in addition in 2002 we recognized 711000 in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest in 2005 we expect management development and other fees to increase as we begin to earn asset and property management fees from the discretionary investment fund discussed elsewhere in this report direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased in both 2004 and 2003 due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with increased expenses due to salary increases and leasing bonuses as well as increased makeready costs associated with increasing occupancy for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 2131000 or 22 to 141823000 in 2004 due primarily to increased salaries and leasing bonuses as well as increased makeready costs associated with increasing occupancy as discussed above during 2003 operating expenses increased 5724000 or 61 due primarily to inclement weather increased insurance costs and bad debt expenses we expect expense growth in 2005 to be consistent with growth levels in 2004 with pressure on salaries and utilities partially offset by moderation in bad debt expenses marketing costs and insurance property taxes increased in both 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes partially offset by property tax refunds for established communities property taxes increased in 2004 and 2003 by 333000 and 1470000 respectively as compared to the prior year due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions partially offset by successful tax appeals we expect property taxes to 45 

  increase in 2005 as local jurisdictions are expected to continue to seek additional revenue sources to offset budget deficits we manage property tax increases internally as well as engage thirdparty consultants and appeal increases when appropriate corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in 2004 due to increased compensation costs during 2003 corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased due to associate separation costs as well as increased corporatelevel marketing and customer service costs to respond to pressure on economic occupancy investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions investment management and abandoned pursuit costs which include the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits acquisition pursuits and technology investments investments and investment management increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to costs incurred in forming a potential discretionary investment fund increased compensation costs and increased abandoned pursuit costs investments and investment management decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to decreases in abandoned pursuit costs abandoned pursuit costs were 1726000 1180000 and 2800000 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile and the activity experienced in any given year may not be experienced in future years we expect investments and investment management costs to continue to increase in 2005 due to the costs associated with operating and managing the investment fund interest expense decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the repayment of unsecured debt and reissuance at lower interest rates overall lower interest rates and lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility interest expense increased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to the issuance in late 2002 of unsecured notes and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility partially offset by the repayment of certain unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both shortterm and longterm borrowings we expect interest expense to increase in 2005 as interest rates rise and we increase our leverage from current levels depreciation expens e increased in both 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities as well as the acquisition of new communities in 2002 and 2004 general and administrative expense “ga” increased in 2004 as a result of higher compensation expense increased litigation and settlement costs associated with certain community and corporate matters and additional corporate governance costs including costs relating to compliance with sarbanesoxley ga increased in 2003 as a result of construction litigation relating to a community that has completed development and increased directors and officers “do” insurance which was renewed in march 2003 we expect ga to continue to increase in 2005 due to increased corporate governance primarily sarbanesoxley compliance and compensation costs but at a reduced pace as compared to 2004 impairment loss of 6800000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition no impairment losses were recorded in either 2004 or 2003 equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased in 2004 and increased in 2003 primarily due to our share of the gain received on a community sold in 2003 which was accounted for under the equity method in which we held a 50 interest interest income decreased in 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates in addition effective january 1 2004 we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note due to the implementation of fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities and interpretation of arb no 51” as revised in december 2003 therefore interest income that we recognized in 2003 and 2002 is not reflected in 2004 as such amounts were eliminated in consolidation see note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of the consolidated financial statements on october 15 2004 we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity the mortgage note was repaid prior to its scheduled 46 

  maturity and therefore the total proceeds of 33994000 included an early prepayment premium of approximately 1240000 net of related legal costs along with the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest upon repayment of the mortgage note our economic interest in this entity ended and therefore this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under fin 46 and we discontinued consolidation venture partner interest in profitsharing represents the income allocated to our venture partner in a profitsharing arrangement as discussed in note 6 “investments in unconsolidated entities” of our consolidated financial statements fluctuations as compared to prior years are due to changes in the net income of the underlying real estate effective december 31 2004 we no longer account for our interest in this venture as a profitsharing arrangement minority interest in consolidated partnerships decreased in 2004 due to the consolidation of an entity under fin 46 as discussed above we do not hold an equity interest in this entity and therefore 100 of the entity’s net income or loss is recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from january 1 2002 through december 31 2004 the decreases in 2004 and 2003 are due to the timing of the sale of five communities in 2004 and eleven communities in 2003 gain on sale of communities decreased in 2004 and increased in 2003 due to the volume of disposition activity in each year the amount of gains realized depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area we expect to continue to sell communities based on overall portfolio allocation needs as well as to respond to opportunities in the market to maximize risk adjusted returns cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is a result of the implementation of fin 46 discussed above and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under fin 46 and the previously recorded net assets dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased during 2004 and 2003 primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during 2003 and 2002 funds from operations “ffo” is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report liquidity and capital resources factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing source and amount of cash flow provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment particularly to changes in interest rates the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage as well as our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity are affected by changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates or the availability of costeffective capital 47 

  we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flow from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund  we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility cash and cash equivalents totaled 1582000 at december 31 2004 a decrease of 5476000 from 7058000 on december 31 2003 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report operating activities — net cash provided by operating activities increased to 275678000 in 2004 from 239677000 in 2003 primarily due to additional noi from recently acquired and developed communities partially offset by the loss of noi from the 16 communities sold in 2004 and 2003 as discussed earlier in this report investing activities — net cash used in investing activities of 251683000 in 2004 related to investments in assets through development redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and the receipt of payment on a participating mortgage note during 2004 we invested 498020000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures  financing activities — net cash used in financing activities totaled 29471000 in 2004 consisting primarily of dividends paid and certain debt repayments partially offset by a decrease in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility issuance of mortgage notes payable issuance of common stock for option 48 

  exercises and issuance of unsecured notes see note 3 “notes payable unsecured notes and credit facility” and note 4 “stockholders’ equity” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information variable rate unsecured credit facility we have a 500000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and wachovia bank na serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial banks under the terms of the credit facility if we elect to increase the facility by up to an additional 150000000 and one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment then we will be able to increase the facility up to 650000000 and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds we pay participating banks in the aggregate an annual facility fee of approximately 750000 in quarterly installments the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 055 per annum 302 on february 28 2005 the spread over libor can vary from libor plus 050 to libor plus 115 based upon the rating of our longterm unsecured debt in addition a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 250000000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow we had 100000000 outstanding under this competitive bid option at february 28 2005 priced at libor plus 029 or 278 we are subject to i certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility including but not limited to maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels and ii prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95 of our ffo except as may be required to maintain our reit status the credit facility matures in may 2008 assuming our exercise of a oneyear renewal option at february 28 2005 291500000 was outstanding 27251000 was used to provide letters of credit and 181249000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility future financing and capital needs — debt maturities one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our longterm liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory the following debt activity occurred during 2004  49 

   in january 2005 we repaid 150000000 in previously issued unsecured notes along with any unpaid interest pursuant to their scheduled maturity no prepayment penalty was incurred in addition in march 2005 we issued 100000000 in unsecured notes under our existing shelf registration statement at an annual effective interest rate of 4999 interest on these notes is payable semiannually on march 15 and september 15 and they mature in march 2013 we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission the shelf registration statement originally provided 750000000 of debt and equity capacity however only 370984000 remains outstanding after consideration of the march 2005 issuance discussed above we cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on costeffective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times the table on the following page details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our unsecured credit facility for debt outstanding at december 31 2004 dollars in thousands 50

  future financing and capital needs — portfolio and other activity as of december 31 2004 we had ten new communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 145012000 remained to be invested in addition we had four communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 15710000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from  before planned reconstruction activity including reconstruction activity related to a discretionary investment fund discussed below or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights writeoff associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred we have engaged in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities this fund would serve for a period of three years from its initial closing date or until 80 of its committed capital is invested as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities subject to certain exceptions these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund if any the fund would not restrict our development activities and would terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions as of february 28 2005 we have acquired four communities with the intent of being owned by the fund but which are currently consolidated and included in our operating results we are currently targeting acquisitions for the fund where value creation opportunities are present through one or more of the following redevelopment activities market cycle opportunities or improved property operations we expect the fund to have equity commitments of up to 330000000 and the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65 on a portfolio basis which would enable the fund to invest up to 940000000 we would contribute 20 of the total equity up to 50000000 we expect closing on the equity funding during the first quarter of 2005 there can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or if formed what its size terms or investment performance will be we have also recently increased our use of joint ventures to hold individual real estate assets pursuant to which certain developments will be held upon completion through partnership vehicles we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement however we cannot assure you that we will continue to enter into joint ventures in the future or that if we do we will achieve our objectives 52 

  the following joint venture activity occurred during 2004  in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets we often sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities in response to real estate and capital markets conditions including strong institutional demand for product in our markets we sold five communities in 2004 and anticipate selling additional communities when opportunities arise for harvesting value in 2005 however we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce future total revenues total expenses noi and ffo as of february 28 2005 we have two communities classified as held for sale under gaap we are actively pursuing the disposition of these communities and expect to close on these dispositions in 2005 however we cannot assure you that these communities will be sold as planned off balance sheet arrangements we own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities with ownership interests up to 50 three of these unconsolidated real estate entities avalon terrace llc cvp i llc and avalonbay redevelopment llc have debt outstanding as of december 31 2004 avalon terrace llc has 22500000 of variable rate debt which matures in november 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate cvp i llc has a 117000000 construction loan which matures in february 2009 assuming exercise of two oneyear renewal options and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity avalonbay redevelopment llc has 36124000 of variable rate debt which matures in april 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate we have not guaranteed the debt on avalon terrace llc and avalonbay redevelopment llc nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so however in connection with the general contractor services that we provide to cvp i llc the entity that owns and is developing avalon chrystie place i we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the construction financing our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion once all of the lender’s standard completion requirements have been satisfied we currently expect this to occur in 2006 there are no lines of credit side agreements financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt for more information 53 

  regarding the operations of our unconsolidated entities see note 6 “investments in unconsolidated real estate entities” of our consolidated financial statements contractual obligations we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of longterm debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december 31 2004 dollars in thousands  

 inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in an inflationary environment this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases forwardlooking statements this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to  54

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates we had 217174000 and 168505000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2004 and 2003 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 3682000 and 2665000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 55 

  we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness under swap agreements  as of december 31 2004 the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately 69000000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt furthermore a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately 22500000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt existed as of december 31 2004 the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate taxexempt debt was not electively entered into by us but rather was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our taxexempt bond financings because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider had these swap agreements not been in place during 2004 and 2003 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 2769000 and 6027000 lower respectively based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years however if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2004 and 2003 and these swap agreements had not been in place our annual interest costs would have been approximately 2073000 and 4581000 lower respectively in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 2340843000 at december 31 2004 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 2532620000 at december 31 2004 fixed rate debt represented 2123669000 of the carrying value and 2246602000 of the fair value at december 31 2004 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2004 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by 101157000 56

 item 1   business tableend general avalonbay communities inc is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we focus on the development redevelopment acquisition ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states this is because we believe that long term the limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states we believe that we have penetrated substantially all of the high barriertoentry markets of the country at february 27 2004 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 131 operating apartment communities containing 38504 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which two communities containing 1089 apartment homes were under reconstruction in addition we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 11 communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of 3493 apartment homes when completed we also owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in rights to develop an additional 40 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 10070 apartment homes we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community in selecting sites for development redevelopment or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments established communities other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year developmentredevelopment communities consist of communities that are under construction communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under leaseup a more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report our principal financial goal is to increase longterm stockholder value by successfully and costeffectively developing redeveloping acquiring owning and operating highquality communities in our selected markets that contain features and amenities desired by residents as well as by providing our residents with efficient and effective service to help fulfill this goal we regularly i monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type ii develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets with growing or high potential for demand iii selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our longterm strategy due to product type location or relative potential for future appreciation and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and iv endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such that we maintain continuous access to costeffective capital our longterm strategy is to more deeply penetrate the high barriertoentry markets in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale commanding among the highest rents in their submarkets we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal to offer a broad range of products and services 1   during the three years ended december 31 2003 we acquired five apartment communities disposed of 20 apartment communities and completed the development of 23 apartment communities and the redevelopment of three apartment communities during 2003 we shifted from acquiring to selling apartment communities in response to strong investor demand allowing us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle as well as providing additional liquidity in 2004 we plan to continue our disposition activity although at a reduced level and we expect to expand our acquisition and development volume the level of disposition acquisition or development activity however is heavily influenced by capital market conditions including prevailing interest rates a further discussion of our development redevelopment disposition and acquisition strategy follows development strategy we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive offices in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following cities  after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks as well as preserves capital after we acquire land we generally shift our focus to construction except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers we act as our own general contractor and construction manager we generally perform these functions directly and not through a subsidiary both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure highquality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operational phase throughout this report the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle including pursuit of zoning approvals procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process references to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property which is only one element of the development cycle redevelopment strategy  when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to generally renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is significantly below replacement cost and the community is one of the highest quality apartment communities or best rental values for an apartment community in its local area we have established procedures to minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure highquality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phase 2   throughout this report the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs budgeting and actual renovation work the actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle disposition strategy we sell assets when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across geographic regions this also allows us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle as well as provides additional liquidity we are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target from time to time in order to achieve rapid penetration into markets that are generally supply constrained and in which we desire an increased presence and to help us achieve our desired product mix or to rebalance our portfolio we will acquire existing apartment communities property management strategy  we intend to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities and controlled operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include  controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we control operating expenses as follows  onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income produced at their respective communities we generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly and not through a subsidiary both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner we are also pursuing ancillary services which could provide additional revenue sources in general as a reit we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such services however we can provide such noncustomary services to residents if we do so through a “taxable reit subsidiary” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “c corporation” and is therefore subject to federal income taxes we have used taxable reit subsidiaries on a limited basis such as to receive a commission from a “preferred provider” maid service company used by residents 3   technology strategy we believe that an innovative management information system infrastructure is an important element in managing our future growth this is because timely and accurate collection of financial and resident profile data will enable us to maximize revenue through careful leasing decisions and financial management we currently have minority investments in three technology companies these investments were made with the belief that they would promote the development and application of technology and services which would improve the operating performance of our real estate holdings our technology investments consist of i an entity engaged in the development and deployment of an onsite property management and leasing automation system that enables management to capture review and analyze data to a greater extent than is possible using existing commercial software ii an entity formed by a number of real estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of investing in multisector real estate technology opportunities and iii an internetbased rental housing information provider financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to maintain a capital structure that is aligned to the business risks presented by our corporate strategy at december 31 2003 our debttototal market capitalization was 399 and our permanent longterm floating rate debt not including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility was 14 of total market capitalization total market capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of our common stock the market value of our operating partnership units outstanding based on the market value of our common stock the liquidation preference of our preferred stock and the outstanding principal amount of our debt we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash and borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility if required to meet the balance of our current or anticipated liquidity needs we will attempt to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility sell existing communities or land andor issue additional debt or equity securities a determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions including interest rates our short and long term liquidity needs the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities a summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report while we believe we have the financial position to expand our shortterm credit capacity and access the capital markets as needed we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements sales or offerings the failure to complete these transactions on a costeffective basis or at all could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition we may from time to time enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the property or properties owned directly by such joint venture or partnership our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of facts and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community who may prefer that or who may require less payment if the land or community is contributed to a joint venture or partnership ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projection in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle is used any future investments in joint ventures or partnerships will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement in addition we may from time to time offer shares of our equity securities debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property while we emphasize equity real estate investments in apartment communities we have the ability which would be exercised in the discretion of our board of directors to invest in other types of real estate mortgages including participating or convertible mortgages securities of other reits or real estate operating companies or securities of 4   technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents in each case consistent with our qualification as a reit on occasion we own and operate retail space at our communities when either i the highest and best use of the space is for retail eg street level in an urban area or ii we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents as of december 31 2003 we had a total of 192040 square feet of rentable retail space that produced gross rental revenue in 2003 of 2329000 04 of total revenue any investment in securities of other entities is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification our current policy does not contemplate future investments in mortgages or deeds of trust we have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so at all times we intend to make investments in a manner as to qualify as a reit unless because of circumstances or changes to the internal revenue code or the treasury regulations the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit inflation and deflation substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases combined with relatively consistent demand have allowed rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive inflation hedge however in a deflationary rent environment as is currently being experienced we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases tax matters we filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level competition we face competition from other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds partnerships and investment companies and other apartment reits to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development as an owner and operator of apartment communities we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value proposition given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks we also compete with the condominium and singlefamily home markets although we often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition environmental and related matters under various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by these parties as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to borrow against sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 5   certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of reconstruction remodeling renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose liability for release of acms and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of several of the communities that we acquired we have implemented an operations and maintenance program for each of the communities at which acms have been detected we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present however we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 6   we cannot assure you that  other information our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 are available free of charge in the “investor relations” section of our website wwwavalonbaycom as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the sec we were incorporated under the laws of the state of california in 1978 in 1995 we reincorporated in the state of maryland and have been focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time as of december 31 2003 we had 1622 employees 

 our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights as defined below our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities the following is a description of each category current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup or redevelopment according to the following attributes  7    development communities are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities may be partially complete and operating development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable as of december 31 2003 our communities were classified as follows  

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 8   current communities the current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings the current communities as of february 27 2004 include 98 gardenstyle of which 10 are mixed communities and include townhomes 19 highrise and 14 midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following  other features at various communities may include  we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and where vacant available for immediate occupancy we believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 9   these current communities are located in the following geographic markets  

we manage and operate all of the current communities during the year ended december 31 2003 we completed construction of 1959 apartment homes in seven communities and sold 3634 apartment homes in twelve communities the average age of the current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 81 years of the current communities as of february 27 2004 we own  10    we also hold a fee simple ownership interest in nine of the development communities a membership interest in a limited liability company that owns one development community and a general partnership interest in a partnership structured as a “downreit” that owns one development community in each of our six partnerships structured as downreits either avalonbay or one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount each downreit partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the applicable partnership agreement the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present each unit of limited partnership interest for redemption for cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of redemption in lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount as of february 27 2004 there were 589412 downreit partnership units outstanding the downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 11   profile of current development and unconsolidated communities 1 dollars in thousands except per apartment home data

1 for the purpose of this table current communities excludes communities held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures 24   development communities as of february 27 2004 we had eleven development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 3493 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capital cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 671900000 statements regarding the future development or performance of the development communities are forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that  you should carefully review the discussion under “risks of development and redevelopment” included elsewhere in this item 2 25   the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted  

 26   redevelopment communities as of february 27 2004 we had two communities under redevelopment we expect the total capital cost to complete these communities including the cost of acquisition capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment to be approximately 203800000 of which approximately 34200000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be invested during redevelopment and 5800000 has been invested since acquisition unrelated to redevelopment statements regarding the future redevelopment or performance of the redevelopment communities are forwardlooking statements we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedules for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate see the discussion under “risks of development and redevelopment” included elsewhere in this report the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities  

 development rights as of february 27 2004 we are considering the development of 40 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold a purchase option we generally hold development rights through options to acquire land although for 10 of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 10070 apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2003 there were cumulative capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 31334000 relating to development rights in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 81358000 are reflected as land held for development on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2003 the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to pursue if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes deeming future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense 22   because we intend to limit the percentage of debt used to finance new developments other financing alternatives may be required to help finance the development of those development rights scheduled to start construction after january 1 2004 although the development of any particular development right cannot be assured we believe that the development rights in the aggregate present attractive potential opportunities for future development and growth of longterm stockholder value statements regarding the future development of the development rights are forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that  28   the following presents a summary of the 40 development rights we are currently pursuing  

 29   risks of development and redevelopment we intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment home communities our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed to the following  the occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect results of operations and our payment of distributions to our stockholders construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in the community’s market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes to those market conditions that we anticipated at that time although we attempt to anticipate changes in market conditions we cannot predict those changes with certainty construction costs have been increasing and for some of our development communities the total construction costs have been or are expected to be higher than the original budget total capital cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective development or redevelopment community determined in accordance with gaap including  costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs 30   capitalized interest in accordance with gaap we capitalize interest expense during construction or reconstruction until a building obtains a certificate of occupancy interest that is incurred thereafter and allocated to a completed apartment home within the community is expensed capitalized interest during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 totaled 24709000 and 29937000 respectively recent developments sales of existing communities we seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barriertoentry markets where we believe we can  to achieve this increased concentration we i sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment strategy due to product type location or relative potential for future appreciation and ii redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop redevelop and acquire communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction we sold twelve communities totaling 3634 apartment homes during the period from january 1 2003 through february 27 2004 net proceeds from the sale of these assets were 396518000 land acquisitions  we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2003 we acquired four land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of 17730000 the land parcels purchased which are currently held for future development are as follows  

 31   insurance and risk of uninsured losses we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults a large concentration of our communities lie near and thus are susceptible to the major fault lines in the san francisco bay area including the san andreas fault and the hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in july 2003 we renewed our earthquake insurance we have in place with respect to communities located in california for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building the five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of 100000 per occurrence earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a 75000000 limit except with respect to the state of washington for which the limit is 65000000 our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence in addition up to an annual aggregate of 2000000 the next 400000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was renewed on august 1 2003 although the insurance coverage provided for in the renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year the level of our deductible and premium costs has increased including the costs we estimate that we may incur as a result of deductibles we expect the cost related to these insurance categories for the policy period from august 1 2003 to july 31 2004 to increase approximately 500000 as compared to the prior period our property insurance policy was scheduled to renew on november 1 2003 however in an effort to capitalize on declining insurance rates we elected to renew effective july 31 2003 with an expiration date of february 1 2005 based on this renewal we have seen a decline in insurance premiums for property coverage which combined with the cost we may incur as a result of deductibles will result in flat or declining overall insurance costs as compared to prior periods just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been recent reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in november 2002 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act “tria” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 200000000 additionally we have purchased insurance for certain terrorist acts not covered under tria such as domesticbased terrorism this insurance often referred to as “noncertified” terrorism insurance is subject to deductibles limits and exclusions our general liability policy provides tria coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is present 32   however we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities we cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities in march 2003 we renewed our directors and officers do insurance since then we have noted an increase in competition from new carriers entering the market and expanded capital capacity of existing carriers resulting in a partial reversal of the significant premium increases experienced in recent years we are currently renewing our coverage for the year beginning march 10 2004 and expect our premium to decline approximately 10 to 12 from the prior coverage period however there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew on such favorable terms americans with disabilities act the apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” andor “commercial facilities” as defined by the americans with disabilities act compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable the americans with disabilities act does not however consider residential properties such as apartment communities to be public accommodations or commercial facilities except to the extent portions of such facilities such as leasing offices are open to the public we believe our properties comply in all material respects with all present requirements under the americans with disabilities act and applicable state laws noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend we are from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business some of these claims and proceedings are expected to be covered by liability insurance the following matter for which based on the advice of counsel we believe we have meritorious defenses and are therefore vigorously defending against is not covered by liability insurance however outstanding litigation matters individually and in the aggregate including the matter described below are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we are currently involved in litigation with york hunter construction inc and national union fire insurance company the action arises from our october 1999 termination of york hunter as construction manager under a contract relating to construction of the avalon willow community in mamaroneck new york because of alleged failures and deficiencies by york hunter and its subcontractors in performing under the contract york hunter initiated the litigation in october 1999 by filing a complaint against us and other defendants claiming more than 7000000 in damages we have filed counterclaims against york hunter seeking more than 7000000 in compensatory damages including lost rental income and costs to complete the community we have also filed a claim against national union fire insurance which furnished construction and performance bonds to us on behalf of york hunter although no assurances can be made with respect to any litigation based on the advice of our counsel in this matter wachtel  masyr llp we believe that we have meritorious defenses against all of york hunter’s claims and are vigorously contesting those claims we also are pursuing our counterclaims against york hunter and national union fire insurance aggressively a nonjury trial commenced on april 29 2003 in the supreme court of the state of new york county of westchester and is ongoing at this time while the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty we do not expect any current litigation including the litigation with york hunter and national union to have a material effect on our business or financial condition

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend we are a real estate investment trust or reit incorporated in the state of maryland and focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states as of december 31 2003 we had 131 current operating communities which are the primary contributors to our overall operating performance the net operating income of these communities which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels and is affected by our ability to control operating costs our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities we create longterm shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms deploying that capital to develop redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets operating apartments and selling communities when they no longer meet our longterm investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable this report including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that predict or indicate future events and trends that do not report historical matters actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page 54 of this report the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report business description and community information overview we believe that apartment communities present an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a real estate cycle we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new household formations are expected to outpace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle barrierstoentry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply we evaluate the appropriate allocation of product type within our individual markets which are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states to ensure that our product mix will perform at a high level and achieve our portfolio objectives our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products which is currently primarily upscale apartment communities and services with an intense focus on our customer a substantial majority of our current communities are upscale commanding among the highest rents in their submarkets we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points consistent with our goal to offer a broad range of products and services we believe that lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle however we believe we are toward the end of a period of the business cycle where rents have been resetting to lower levels resulting in a decline in cash flows in 2003 as compared to prior years a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003 particularly in the technology telecom and financial services sectors this has resulted in continued weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates however the rate of decline has been diminishing and we expect 2004 to be a year of transition an improving economy with modest job growth is anticipated in 2004 which should result in the stabilization of apartment market fundamentals and an improved demand and supply balance during the year although we do not expect this to result in revenue growth for our current operating communities in 2004 it should curtail the significant declines in revenue that those communities experienced over the last two years 38   with the expected transition of apartment fundamentals we are preparing for a transition in certain aspects of our business activity with our inhouse capabilities and expertise we believe we are well positioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop acquire and operate apartment homes in our target markets however the level of development or acquisition volume or disposition activity is heavily influenced by capital and real estate market conditions during 2003 in response to capital markets conditions and strong apartment demand we curtailed development and acquisition activity and increased our disposition activity we sold assets that did not meet our longterm investment criteria in markets where there was strong relative demand by investors in apartment communities this allowed us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and provided additional liquidity in 2004 we plan to continue our disposition activity although at a reduced level and expect to increase development and acquisition volume our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development “development communities” and development rights ie land or land options held for development as further described in item 2 of this report our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities other stabilized communities leaseup communities and redevelopment communities established communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year leaseup communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements although each of these categories is important to our business we generally evaluate overall operating industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities for which a detailed discussion can be found in “results of operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition disposition development redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized redevelopment and development communities for which detailed discussions can be found in “liquidity and capital resources” as of december 31 2003 we owned or held an ownership interest in 142 apartment communities containing 41997 apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia of which eleven communities were under construction and two communities were under reconstruction in addition we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional 40 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 10070 apartment homes critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain and are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results as a reit that owns operates and develops apartment communities our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition cost capitalization asset impairment evaluation and reit status a discussion of all of our accounting policies including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below can be found in note 1 “organization and significant accounting policies” of our consolidated financial statements 39   revenue recognition rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and statement of financial accounting standards no 13 “accounting for leases” in accordance with our standard lease terms rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease – generally one year a discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for established communities can be found in “results of operations” cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when active development commences until the asset or a portion of the asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken outofservice for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors including zoning and regulatory approval rental market conditions construction costs and availability of capital predevelopment costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred in addition if the status of a development right changes deeming future development no longer probable any capitalized predevelopment costs are writtenoff with a charge to expense we generally capitalize only nonrecurring expenditures we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds 15000 ii extends the useful life of the asset and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident under this policy virtually all capitalized costs are nonrecurring as recurring makeready costs are expensed as incurred recurring makeready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements ii floor coverings iii interior painting and iv other redecorating costs because we expense carpet replacements our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year following our peak summer leasing period we capitalize purchases of personal property such as computers and furniture only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds 2500 we generally expense replacements of personal property in 2003 2002 and 2001 the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions development and redevelopment were 296764000 457851000 and 401359000 respectively for established and other stabilized communities we recorded nonrevenue generating capital expenditures of 11064000 or 333 per apartment home in 2003 10214000 or 302 per apartment home in 2002 and 7967000 or 251 per apartment home in 2001 in addition revenue generating capital expenditures such as water submetering equipment and cable installations were 529000 697000 and 1675000 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home including carpet and appliance replacements related to these communities was 1262 in 2003 1224 in 2002 and 1196 in 2001 we anticipate that capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities increases and expensed maintenance costs will fluctuate with turnover 40   asset impairment evaluation if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the community if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the community we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell we account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value due to the nature of these investments an impairment in value can be difficult to determine reit status we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended for the year ended december 31 1994 and have not revoked such election a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 41   results of operations our yearoveryear operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities and capital market disposition and financing activity a comparison of our operating results for the years 2003 2002 and 2001 follows dollars in thousands  

net income available to common stockholders increased 105059000 675 to 260781000 for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase is primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities and the absence of impairment losses in 2003 partially offset by a decline in net operating income from our established communities the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2002 and increases in interest and depreciation expense net income available to common stockholders decreased by 53240000 255 to 155722000 in 2002 due to fewer gains on sales of communities in 2002 and impairment losses recognized in 2002 coupled with a decline in net operating income from our established communities and increases in interest and depreciation partially offset by a decrease in dividends attributable to preferred stock 42   net operating income “noi” is defined by us as total revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excludes corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses interest income and expense general and administrative expense impairment losses equity in income of unconsolidated entities minority interest in consolidated partnerships venture partner interest in profitsharing depreciation expense gain on sale of communities and income from discontinued operations we believe that noi is an important and appropriate supplemental measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporatelevel costs this is more reflective of the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a calculation of noi for the three years ending december 31 2003 along with a reconciliation to net income is provided in the preceding table the noi decreases of 1519000 and 15893000 for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories  

the noi decreases in established communities were largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets the continued impact of job losses in many of our submarkets in addition to strong singlefamily home sales have aggravated a weak demand environment causing market rental rates to decline in order to keep occupancies stable economic forecasts project modest job growth in our submarkets in 2004 and we therefore expect apartment market fundamentals to stabilize during the year although the rate of decline in the apartment market fundamentals is diminishing which should curtail the significant declines in revenue that our established communities have experienced over the last two years we expect our established communities revenue to decline as much as 20 in 2004 as compared to 2003 and operating expenses particularly related to property taxes to continue to increase up to 30 in 2004 resulting in continued year over year declines in our established communities noi of up to 40 for 2004 rental and other income increased in both 2003 and 2002 due to rental income generated from communities acquired in 2002 and newly developed communities partially offset by declines in effective rental rates and business interruption proceeds while we expect apartment fundamentals to stabilize in 2004 with modest job growth in our markets there is typically a three to six month lag between improvements in job growth and improvements in operating performance 43   overall portfolio – the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 33842 apartment homes for 2003 as compared to 31694 apartment homes for 2002 and 31131 in 2001 this change is primarily the result of increased homes available from communities acquired in 2002 and newly developed communities partially offset by communities sold in 2002 and 2003 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to 1496 in 2003 as compared to 1528 in 2002 and 1550 in 2001 primarily due to the weakened demand in certain of our submarkets established communities – rental revenue decreased 20424000 43 in 2003 and 28400000 62 in 2002 these decreases are due to declining effective rental rates partially offset by a slight increase in economic occupancy in 2003 for 2003 the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased 45 to 1437 compared to 1505 for 2002 partially due to increased concessions granted in the latter half of 2002 and during 2003 the average economic occupancy increased from 936 in 2002 to 938 in 2003 economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents we expect rental income for established communities to decline as much as 20 in 2004 as compared to 2003 although most of our markets have experienced weak demand caused by job losses low mortgage rates and shifting demographics rental income from established communities has been impacted the most by significant declines in average rental rates in certain northern california and northeast submarkets northern california which accounted for approximately 310 of established community rental revenue in 2003 experienced a decline in rental revenue 76 in 2003 as compared to 2002 partially related to the continued impact of job losses in the technology sector although economic occupancy in northern california increased in 2003 as compared to 2002 average rental rates dropped 89 from 1547 to 1410 the northeast region accounted for approximately 337 of established community rental revenue during 2003 and has also experienced a decline in rental revenue 37 in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily the result of job losses in the financial services sector average rental rates dropped 36 from 1876 to 1808 in 2003 as compared to 2002 and economic occupancy remained flat during those same periods in accordance with gaap cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term which is generally one year however we consider rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with gaap in helping investors to evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies in addition rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions which is an indicator of current rental market conditions the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 dollars in thousands information for the year ended december 31 2001 is not presented as established community classification is not applicable prior to january 1 2002 see note 9 “segment reporting” of our consolidated financial statements  

44   concessions granted per movein for established communities averaged 848 during 2003 an increase of 1048 from 414 in 2002 concessions granted increased during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to declining market conditions and a weak demand environment we expect the high concessionary environment to continue into 2004 management development and other fees decreased during 2003 and increased during 2002 primarily due to the recognition in 2002 of 711000 in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest in addition we managed fewer communities in 2003 as compared to prior years direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased in both 2003 and 2002 due to the addition of recently developed and redeveloped apartment homes and communities acquired in 2002 coupled with increased expenses due to inclement weather insurance and bad debt expenses in the first half of 2003 severe winter weather primarily in the northeast and midatlantic increased snow removal and utility costs by approximately 1440000 in addition insurance expense has increased over the past two years as the insurance and reinsurance markets have deteriorated resulting in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector recently property insurance rates began to decline to benefit from declining rates we completed an early renewal of our property insurance policy effective july 31 2003 accordingly we expect a decline in property insurance premiums which will result in flat or declining overall insurance costs for 2004 as compared to prior year periods bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of the continued impact of job losses and the weakened economy for established communities direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased 5724000 61 to 99853000 in 2003 due to inclement weather insurance and bad debt discussed above during 2002 operating expenses increased 5227000 65 due to the increases in insurance marketing and bad debt expenses we expect expense growth to moderate in 2004 due to reduced property insurance costs and bad debt expenses property taxes increased in both 2003 and 2002 due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes for established communities property taxes increased in 2003 and 2002 by 1470000 and 879000 respectively primarily due to higher assessments throughout all regions we expect property taxes to increase during 2004 as local jurisdictions look for additional revenue sources to balance budgets we manage property tax increases internally and appeal increases when appropriate corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in 2003 as a result of increased legal expenses due to construction litigation relating to a community that has completed development partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the implementation of a new property management leasing system in 2002 and a decrease in abandoned pursuit costs during 2002 corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased as a result of executive separation costs that were recognized in 2001 but not in 2002 partially offset by an increase in abandoned pursuit costs abandoned pursuit costs related to development rights which are not probable for future development decreased 1620000 from 2800000 in 2002 to 1180000 in 2003 we expect corporatelevel property management and other indirect operating expenses to increase in 2004 due to additional compensation costs including growth due to the addition of newly developed communities and the expensing of options interest expense increased in both 2003 and 2002 primarily due to the issuance in late 2002 of unsecured notes and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility partially offset by the repayment of certain unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both shortterm and longterm borrowings 45   depreciation expense increased in both 2003 and 2002 primarily due to 2002 acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities general and administrative expense “ga” increased in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in our directors and officers “do” insurance which we renewed in march 2003 in the past year the do market has experienced increased and high profile claim activity resulting in higher insurance premiums ga decreased in 2002 as a result of additional compensation expense recognized in 2001 due to the retirement of a senior executive unfilled positions and lower incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in 2002 we expect ga to increase up to 150 in 2004 due to higher compensation expense and additional internal audit and corporate governance costs impairment loss of 6800000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition no impairment losses were recorded in either 2003 or 2001 equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased in 2003 primarily due to our 23448000 share of the gain recognized on the sale of a community accounted for under the equity method in which we held a 50 interest during 2002 equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased primarily due to losses recorded for an investment in a technology company accounted for under the equity method interest income decreased in 2003 and 2002 due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates venture partner interest in profitsharing represents the income allocated to our venture partner in a profitsharing arrangement as discussed in note 6 “investments in unconsolidated entities” of our consolidated financial statements the reduction in incomeincrease in expense in both years are due to increases in the net income of the underlying real estate as the related community moved out of the initial leaseup phase and achieved stabilization income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities held for sale as of december 31 2003 and communities sold during the period from january 1 2002 through december 31 2003 the decreases in both years are primarily due to the sale of one community in 2002 and eleven communities in 2003 gain on sale of communities  including discontinued operations of 160990000 48893000 and 62852000 were realized in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the amount of gains realized depends on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area the large gains on sales of communities reflect our strategy to sell assets in a transactional market environment where buyers are offering prices that are historically high relative to current operating cash flow provided by these communities we believe this is reflective of a broader trend in the capital markets where investments with relatively secure yields and growth potential are being valued more highly than in prior years a partial reversal of these trends could occur if longterm interest rates rise significantly we expect aggregate gains on community sales to decline in 2004 as we sell fewer assets dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased in both 2003 and 2002 primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during 2002 and 2003 in addition in response to the securities and exchange commission clarification of emerging issues task force “eitf”topic d42 “the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock” we have revised the presentation of our 2003 and 2001 operating results to include the initial offering costs as additional dividends of 280000 and 7538000 respectively 46   funds from operations “ffo” is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo see “selected financial data” included in item 6 of this report 47   liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations operating cash flows have historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned ii rental rates iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes the timing source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment particularly to changes in interest rates changes in the capital markets environment such as changes in interest rates affect our plans for development redevelopment acquisition and disposition activity cash and cash equivalents totaled 7196000 at december 31 2003 a decrease of 5715000 from 12911000 on december 31 2002 the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report operating activities – net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 239815000 in 2003 from 307810000 in 2002 primarily due to the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds and changes in noi from established communities as discussed earlier in this report coupled with the timing of payment of our property insurance premiums investing activities – net cash provided by investing activities of 33935000 in 2003 related to proceeds from asset dispositions partially offset by investments in assets through development and redevelopment of apartment communities during 2003 we invested 369387000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures  in addition we sold twelve communities and one land parcel in 2003 including one community previously held through an equity investment generating net proceeds of 403118000 these proceeds are being used to develop new communities and to partially repay amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility which is discussed below 48   financing activities – net cash used in financing activities totaled 279465000 for the year ended december 31 2003 primarily due to the redemption of preferred stock dividends paid repayment of certain unsecured notes and common stock repurchases partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility the issuance of mortgage notes payable and an issuance of common stock see note 3 “notes payable unsecured notes and credit facility” and note 4 “stockholders’ equity” of our consolidated financial statements for additional information we regularly review our liquidity needs the adequacy of cash flow from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund  we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flows provided by operating activities proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility variable rate unsecured credit facility we have a 500000000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jp morgan chase and fleet national bank serving as coagents for a syndicate of commercial banks under the terms of the credit facility if we elect to increase the facility by up to an additional 150000000 and one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment then we will be able to increase the facility up to 650000000 and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds we pay participating banks in the aggregate an annual facility fee of approximately 750000 in quarterly installments the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 060 per annum 170 on february 27 2004 pricing could vary if there is a change in rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies a change in rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 005 to 015 a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 400000000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow we had 125000000 outstanding under this competitive bid option at february 27 2004 priced at libor plus 039 or 148 we are subject to i certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility including but not limited to maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels and ii prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95 of our ffo except as may be required to maintain our reit status the existing facility matures in may 2004 unless we exercise a oneyear renewal at our option we expect to renegotiate this facility prior to maturity without exercising the renewal option however there can be no assurance that the renegotiation will occur at february 27 2004 230100000 was outstanding 22304000 was used to provide letters of credit and 247596000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 49   future financing and capital needs – debt maturities one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings we also anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that when a debt obligation matures a portion of each maturity can be satisfied from this retained cash although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our longterm liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory in february 2004 125000000 in unsecured notes with an annual interest rate of 658 matured and was repaid with proceeds drawn under our unsecured credit facility in addition we repaid 11381000 in fixed rate mortgage debt secured by a current community along with any unpaid interest prior to its scheduled maturity of august 2004 no prepayment penalties were incurred also in february 2004 we had credit enhancements including interest rate swaps on approximately 87380000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt that expired according to the original terms and that have not been extended however we have replaced the credit enhancements on this debt including replacing the interest rate swaps with interest rate caps ranging from 67 to 90 the underlying debt has a weighted average variable interest rate exclusive of credit enhancement fees facility fees trustees’ fees etc of 09 as of february 27 2004 which has been capped at a weighted average interest rate of 76 through the interest rate caps the credit enhancements including the interest rate caps mature in 2014 50   the following table details debt maturities for the next five years excluding our unsecured credit facility for debt outstanding at december 31 2003 dollars in thousands  

 51   future financing and capital needs – portfolio and other activity as of december 31 2003 we had eleven new communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 221629000 remained to be invested in addition we had two communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 5660000 remained to be invested substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from  before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights writeoff associated predevelopment costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities we increased our disposition program during 2003 to a level totaling 453900000 in response to real estate and capital markets conditions as well as strong institutional demand for product in our markets we plan to continue to sell communities into 2004 although at reduced levels however we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income but reduce total revenues total expenses noi and ffo we intend to engage in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the possible formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities this fund would serve for a period of three years from the date of its final closing or until a significant portion of its committed capital is invested as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities subject to certain exceptions including among others significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions properties acquired in taxdeferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund if any the fund would not restrict our development activities which would not be a part of the fund and would terminate after a term of eight years subject to two oneyear extensions we intend to actively pursue the formation of the fund but there can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or if formed what its size terms or investment performance will be we have preliminarily targeted that the fund would have approximately 715000000 available for investment consisting of approximately 250000000 of fund equity of which we would commit approximately 20 of the total and approximately 465000000 of debt financing we are also considering the use of several joint ventures pursuant to which a portion of future developments would be held through a partnership vehicle we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity each joint venture or partnership agreement will be individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement however we cannot assure you that we will enter into joint ventures in the future or that if we do we will achieve our objectives 52   we have minority interest investments in three technology companies one of which has a remaining unfunded commitment of 1598000 which we expect to be released from without payment in the first quarter of 2004 we have no other obligation to contribute additional funds to these technology

 common and preferred stock activity stock repurchase program in 2002 our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions the stock repurchase program was designed so that retained cash flow as well as the proceeds from sales of existing apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions will provide the source of funding for the program with our unsecured credit facility providing temporary funding as needed through february 27 2004 we have acquired 2380600 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 89566000 under this program we have not repurchased any shares of common stock since march 31 2003 issuance of common stock in august 2003 we completed a common stock offering totaling 2804700 shares at a public offering price of 4600 per share the net proceeds from this offering after underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 127333000 were used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding on the unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes 53   shelf registration statement we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission the shelf registration statement originally provided 750000000 of debt and equity capacity however 127333000 has been utilized as a result of the common stock offering described above we cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on costeffective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times redemption of preferred stock in march 2003 we redeemed all 3267700 outstanding shares of our 800 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of 2500 per share plus 00167 in accrued and unpaid dividends for an aggregate redemption price of 81747000 including accrued dividends of 54000 the redemption price was funded by the sale of 3336611 shares of series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a net purchase price of 81737000 the dividend rate on such shares was initially equal to 278 per annum threemonth libor plus 15 of the liquidation preference as permitted under the terms of such preferred stock we redeemed all of the series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock in may 2003 for an aggregate redemption price of 82207000 including dividends of 251000 we currently have the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at a stated value of 100000000 this series has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions  

inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in the event of significant inflation this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment as is currently being experienced we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases forwardlooking statements this form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “may” “shall” “will” 54   and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends or that do not report historical matters these statements include among other things statements regarding our intent belief or expectations with respect to  we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following  55   these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements and you should not rely upon them after the date of this report

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates we had 168505000 and 173840000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2003 and 2002 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 2665000 and 2557000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years we currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness under swap agreements  as of december 31 2003 the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately 157500000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt furthermore a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately 22500000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt existed as of december 31 2003 the swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate taxexempt debt were not electively entered into by us but rather were a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our taxexempt bond financings because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider had these swap agreements not been in place during 2003 and 2002 our annual interest costs would have been approximately 6027000 and 5674000 lower respectively based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years however if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2003 and 2002 and these swap agreements had not been in place our annual interest costs would have been approximately 4581000 and 4024000 lower respectively in addition changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness debt securities and notes payable excluding our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of 2286433000 at december 31 2003 had an estimated aggregate fair value of 2555733000 at december 31 2003 fixed rate debt represented 2169028000 of the carrying value and 2280828000 of the fair value at december 31 2003 if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of december 31 2003 the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by 104989000 56

 item 1 business general avalonbay communities inc is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we focus on the ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities which generally command among the highest rents in their submarkets in high barriertoentry markets of the united states this is because we believe that long term the limited new supply of upscale apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land “infill locations” is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states we believe that we have penetrated substantially all of the high barriertoentry markets of the country at february 1 2003 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 137 operating apartment communities containing 40179 apartment homes in eleven states and the district of columbia of which two communities containing 1089 apartment homes were under reconstruction in addition we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 12 communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of 3429 apartment homes when completed we also owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in rights to develop an additional 38 communities that if developed in the manner expected will contain an estimated 9950 apartment homes we generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community in selecting sites for development redevelopment or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to recreation areas entertainment shopping and dining our real estate investments consist of established communities other stabilized communities development communities and redevelopment communities a description of these segments and other related information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report our principal operating objectives are to develop own and operate in our selected markets highquality upscale communities that contain features and amenities desired by prospective residents and to provide our residents with efficient and effective service our principal financial goals are to successfully implement those operating objectives in a cost effective manner and thereby increase longterm stockholder value by increasing operating cash flow and funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts for a description of the meaning of funds from operations and its use and limitation as an operating measure see the discussion titled “funds from operations” in item 7 of this report our strategies to achieve these objectives and goals include  1   we believe that we can generally implement these strategies best by developing redeveloping acquiring and managing upscale assets in high barriertoentry markets while maintaining the financial discipline to ensure balance sheet flexibility development strategy we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development as one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our principal executive offices in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following cities  after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and longterm conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated risks as well as preserves capital after we acquire land we generally shift our focus to construction except for certain midrise and highrise apartment communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or construction managers we act as our own general contractor and construction manager we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our development property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure highquality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operational phase redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our goal is to generally renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is significantly below replacement cost and the community is the highest quality apartment community or best rental value for an upscale apartment community in its local area we have established procedures to minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure highquality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leaseup and restabilization phase disposition strategy to optimize our concentration of communities in selected high barriertoentry markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities under construction or reconstruction this disposition strategy acts as a source of capital because we are able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and tax ramifications of each proposal in connection with this disposition strategy we have disposed of one community since january 1 2002 the net proceeds from the sale of this community were approximately 78454000 we expect to increase our disposition activity during 2003 in response to current and anticipated real estate and capital markets conditions however we cannot assure you that assets can be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or at all or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target between january 1 2002 and february 1 2003 we acquired two 2   communities containing 706 apartment homes one of which was acquired in connection with a forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997 the acquisition of these communities was designed to achieve rapid penetration into markets that are generally supply constrained and in which we desired an increased presence property management strategy we intend to increase operating income through innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities and controlled operating expenses our principal strategies to maximize revenue include  controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue thereby increasing operating margins we aggressively pursue real estate tax appeals and control operating expenses as follows  onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income produced at their respective communities we are also pursuing ancillary services which could provide additional revenue sources technology strategy we believe that an innovative management information system infrastructure is an important element in managing our future growth this is because timely and accurate collection of financial and resident profile data will enable us to maximize revenue through careful leasing decisions and financial management we currently have investments in three technology companies these investments were made with the belief that they would promote the development and application of technology and services which would improve the operating performance of our real estate holdings historically our most significant technology investment has been realeum inc “realeum” an entity engaged in the development and deployment of an onsite property management and leasing automation system that enables management to capture review and analyze data to a greater extent than is possible using existing commercial software to help monitor this investment thomas j sargeant our executive vice president and chief financial officer is a director of realeum after consideration of our share of realeum’s losses the carrying value of our investment in realeum has been reduced to zero as of december 31 2002 we are also a member of constellation real technologies llc “constellation” an entity formed by a number of real estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of investing in multisector real estate technology opportunities our original commitment to constellation was 4000000 but as a result of an agreement among the members reducing the commitment due from each member our commitment is currently 2600000 of which we have contributed 959000 to date the remaining unfunded commitment of 1641000 is expected to be funded over the next five years our third investment is in rentcom an internetbased rental housing information provider the aggregate carrying value of our technology investments at february 1 2003 was 1404000 3   financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to maintain a conservative capital structure at december 31 2002 our debttototal market capitalization was 461 and our permanent longterm floating rate debt not including borrowings under the unsecured credit facility was only 20 of total market capitalization market capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of common stock the liquidation preference of preferred stock and the principal amount of debt before planned construction or reconstruction activity begins we intend to arrange adequate capital sources to complete such undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing during 2002 substantially all of our construction and reconstruction activities were funded by the issuance of unsecured debt securities net proceeds from asset sales and retained operating cash in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon planned development activities writeoff associated pursuit costs andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such pursuits we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from retained operating cash and borrowings under our 500000000 variable rate unsecured credit facility at february 28 2003 155470000 was outstanding 15529000 was used to provide letters of credit and 329001000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility if required to meet the balance of our liquidity needs we will attempt to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility sell additional existing communities or land andor issue additional debt or equity securities while we believe we have the financial position to expand our shortterm credit capacity and access the capital markets as needed we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements sales or offerings the failure to complete these transactions on a costeffective basis or at all could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition including the abandonment of development pursuits inflation and deflation substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rent our current policy is generally to allow residents to terminate leases upon an agreed advance written notice and a lease termination payment as provided for in the resident’s lease shortterm leases combined with relatively consistent demand have allowed rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive inflation hedge however in a deflationary rent environment as is currently being experienced we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases tax matters we filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level environmental and related matters under various federal state and local environmental laws regulations and ordinances a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by these parties as a result of the contamination these damages and costs may be substantial the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to 4   borrow against sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials “acms” when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of reconstruction remodeling renovation or demolition of a building these laws may impose liability for release of acms and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to acms we are not aware that any acms were used in the construction of the communities we developed acms were however used in the construction of several of the communities that we acquired we have implemented an operations and maintenance program for each of the communities at which acms have been detected we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of acms at our communities we are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities we do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties have not revealed and we are not otherwise aware of any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants in some cases an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination there can be no assurance however that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified in full or at all in the event that environmental liability arises mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions to help limit mold growth we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture we have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented however we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner if a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities additionally we have occasionally been involved in developing managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties 5   we cannot assure you that  other information our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934 are available free of charge in the “investor relations” section of our website wwwavalonbaycom as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the sec we were incorporated under the laws of the state of california in 1978 in 1995 we reincorporated in the state of maryland and have been focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time as of december 31 2002 we had 1775 employees item 2 communities our real estate investments consist of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development and land or land options held for development the following is a description of each category   6     as of december 31 2002 our communities were classified as follows  our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages 7   current communities the current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings the current communities as of february 1 2003 include 106 gardenstyle 17 highrise and 14 midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following  other features at various communities may include  we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and where vacant available for immediate occupancy we believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses 8   these current communities are located in the following geographic markets  we manage and operate all of the current communities during the year ended december 31 2002 we completed construction of 2521 apartment homes in ten communities for a total cost of 466600000 the average age of the current communities on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes is 81 years of the current communities as of february 1 2003 we own  9   we also hold a fee simple ownership interest in nine of the development communities a membership interest in a limited liability company that holds a fee simple interest in a development community and a general partnership interest in two partnerships structured as “downreits” that each own one development community in each of the six partnerships structured as downreits either we or one of our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount each downreit partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the applicable partnership agreement the holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present each unit of limited partnership interest for redemption for cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of redemption in lieu of cash we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock as of february 1 2003 there were 975751 downreit

2003 we had 12 development communities under construction we expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 3429 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land acquisition costs of approximately 645700000 statements regarding the future development or performance of the development communities are forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that  you should carefully review the discussion under “risks of development and redevelopment” included elsewhere in this item 2 23   the following table presents a summary of the development communities we hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted   24   redevelopment communities as of february 1 2003 we had two communities under redevelopment we expect the total budgeted cost to complete these communities including the cost of acquisition capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment to be approximately 197800000 of which approximately 28200000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be invested during redevelopment and 5800000 has been invested since acquisition unrelated to redevelopment statements regarding the future redevelopment or performance of the redevelopment communities are forwardlooking statements we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot assure you that we will meet our schedules for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations or that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate see the discussion under “risks of development and redevelopment” included elsewhere in this item 2 the following presents a summary of these redevelopment communities   development rights as of february 1 2003 we are considering the development of 38 new apartment communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a leasehold interest or for which we hold a purchase option we generally hold development rights through options to acquire land although for 11 of the development rights we currently own the land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development the development rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add 9950 upscale apartment homes to our portfolio substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own at december 31 2002 there were cumulative net capitalized costs including legal fees design fees and related overhead costs but excluding land costs of 31461000 relating to development rights in addition land costs related to the pursuit of development rights consisting of original land and additional carrying costs of 78688000 are reflected as land held for development on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2002 these land costs include 19939000 associated with two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and were planned for disposition as of december 31 2002 the properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the development rights to pursue if any or to continue to pursue once an investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make after we perform 25   financial demographic and other analyses in the event that we do not proceed with a development right we generally would not recover capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land however we cannot guarantee a recovery to recognize the possibility of such loss we recognize a charge to expense to provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable capitalized predevelopment costs the determination of a charge to expense relative to pursuits involves management judgment regarding the probability that a pursuit will not proceed to development the amount charged to expense and reflected in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to possible abandoned pursuits was 2800000 and 2200000 for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively because we intend to limit the percentage of debt used to finance new developments other financing alternatives may be required to help finance the development of those development rights scheduled to start construction after january 1 2003 although the development of any particular development right cannot be assured we believe that the development rights in the aggregate present attractive potential opportunities for future development and growth of longterm stockholder value statements regarding the future development of the development rights are forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that  26   the following presents a summary of the 38 development rights we are currently pursuing   27   risks of development and redevelopment we intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment home communities our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed to the following  the occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect our ability to achieve our projected yields on communities under development or redevelopment and could affect results of operations and our payment of distributions to our stockholders construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in the community’s market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes to those market conditions that we anticipated at that time although we attempt to anticipate changes in market conditions we cannot predict with certainty what those changes will be construction costs have been increasing and for some of our development communities the total construction costs have been or are expected to be higher than the original budget total budgeted cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective development or redevelopment community determined in accordance with gaap including  costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or redevelopment communities complete leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs capitalized interest in accordance with gaap we capitalize interest expense during construction or reconstruction until a building obtains a final certificate of occupancy interest that is incurred thereafter and allocated to a completed apartment 28   home within the community is expensed capitalized interest during the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 totaled 29937000 and 27635000 respectively acquisition activities and other recent developments acquisitions of existing communities during the year ended december 31 2002 we acquired two communities the promenade located in burbank california contains 400 apartment homes and was acquired for a total price of 70300000 which includes the assumption of 33900000 of floatingrate taxexempt debt avalon greyrock located in stamford connecticut contains 306 apartment homes and was acquired pursuant to a forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997 with an unaffiliated third party for a total acquisition cost of approximately 69900000 one downreit partnership was formed since january 1 2002 in conjunction with the acquisition of land by that partnership sales of existing communities we seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high barriertoentry markets where we believe we can  to achieve this increased concentration we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities pending such redeployment we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction we sold one community totaling 277 apartment homes since january 1 2002 net proceeds from the sale of this asset were 78454000 29   land acquisitions and leases for new developments we carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development during 2002 we acquired the following land parcels which are currently held for future development   insurance and risk of uninsured losses we carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities these policies and other insurance policies we carry have policy specifications insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable there are however certain types of losses such as losses arising from acts of war that are not insured in full or in part because they are either uninsurable or are not economically feasible if an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur we could lose our capital invested in a community as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community if an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party a significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations we have noted that the insurance and reinsurance markets have worsened as compared to the prior year which we believe have resulted in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector although we will continue to maintain commercially reasonable insurance coverage we believe that the cost of such coverage will increase at a faster rate than other operating expenses many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults a large concentration of our communities lie near and thus are susceptible to the major fault lines in the san francisco bay area including the san andreas fault and hayward fault we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in november 2002 we renewed our earthquake insurance we have in place with respect to communities located in california for any single occurrence and in the aggregate 75000000 of coverage with a deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building the five percent deductible is subject to a minimum of 100000 per occurrence earthquake coverage outside of california is subject to a 100000000 limit except with respect to the state of washington for which the limit is 65000000 our earthquake insurance outside of california provides for a 100000 deductible per occurrence in 30   addition up to an annual aggregate of 2000000 the next 400000 of loss per occurrence outside california will be treated as an additional deductible our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was renewed on august 1 2002 although the insurance coverage provided for in the renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year the level of our deductible and premiums costs has increased including the costs we may incur as a result of deductibles we expect the cost related to these insurance categories for the policy period from august 1 2002 to july 31 2003 to increase approximately 1200000 as compared to the prior period our property insurance which includes the earthquake coverage as previously described and builder’s risk was renewed on november 1 2002 with an increase in the annual premium of approximately 1100000 over the prior period just as with office buildings transportation systems and government buildings there have been recent reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism in november 2002 congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act “tria” which is designed to make terrorism insurance available in connection with this legislation we have purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to 200000000 with the first 15000000 of damage costs payable by us our general liability policy provides coverage subject to deductibles and insured limits for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities in connection with tria we purchased third party liability terrorism insurance for communities with greater than 24 floors which were previously excluded under our general liability policy we cannot assure that we will have full coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities see discussion under “environmental matters” included in item 1 of this report in march 2003 we expect to renew our directors and officers insurance “do” in the past year the do market has experienced increased and high profile claim activity we estimate that our costs for this insurance will increase approximately 80 at renewal americans with disabilities act the apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” andor “commercial facilities” as defined by the americans with disabilities act compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable the americans with disabilities act does not however consider residential properties such as apartment communities to be public accommodations or commercial facilities except to the extent portions of such facilities such as leasing offices are open to the public we believe our properties comply in all material respects with all present requirements under the americans with disabilities act and applicable state laws noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 











 item 3 legal proceedings we are from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business some of these claims and proceedings are expected to be covered by liability insurance the following matter for 31   which we believe we have meritorious defenses and are therefore vigorously defending against is not covered by liability insurance however outstanding litigation matters individually and in the aggregate including the matter described below are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition we are currently involved in litigation with york hunter construction inc and national union fire insurance company the action arises from our october 1999 termination of york hunter as construction manager under a contract relating to construction of the avalon willow community in mamaroneck new york because of alleged failures and deficiencies by york hunter and its subcontractors in performing under the contract york hunter initiated the litigation in october 1999 by filing a complaint against us and other defendants claiming more than 15000000 in damages we have filed counterclaims against york hunter seeking more than 9000000 in compensatory damages including lost rental income and costs to complete the community we have also filed a claim against national union fire insurance which furnished construction and performance bonds to us on behalf of york hunter we believe that we have meritorious defenses against all of york hunter’s claims and are vigorously contesting those claims we also intend to pursue our counterclaims against york hunter and national union fire insurance aggressively the litigation is pending in the supreme court of the state of new york county of westchester a trial date has been set for april 2003

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange nyse and the pacific exchange pcx under the ticker symbol avb the following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices per share of our common stock on the nyse for the years 2002 and 2001 as reported by the nyse on february 1 2003 there were 795 holders of record of an aggregate of 68149232 shares of our outstanding common stock the number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one recordholder  we expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends however dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 33   


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forwardlooking statements this form 10k including the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements which immediately follow contains “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “estimate” “assume” “project” “plan” “will” and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate future events and trends or that do not report historical matters in addition information concerning the following are forwardlooking statements  we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed you should not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements some of the factors that could cause our actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following  37   you should read our consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report in conjunction with the following discussion these forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report we do not undertake to update these forwardlooking statements and you should not rely upon them after the date of this report business description and community information we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we focus on the ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities which generally command among the highest rents in their submarkets in high barriertoentry markets of the united states this is because we believe that long term the limited new supply of upscale apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle however we are in a period of a business cycle where rents are resetting to lower levels resulting in a decline in cash flows in 2002 compared to 2001 these barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land “infill locations” is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california regions of the united states we are a fullyintegrated real estate organization with inhouse expertise in the following areas  we believe apartment communities present an attractive longterm investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a real estate cycle we intend to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new household formations are expected to outpace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle a number of our markets are experiencing economic contraction due to continuing job losses particularly in the technology telecom and financial services sectors we expect these conditions to continue for most of 2003 although we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop and acquire upscale apartment homes based on our inhouse capabilities and expertise we expect to decrease acquisition and development activity during 2003 as compared to prior years and plan to increase disposition activity the level of disposition acquisition or development volume is heavily influenced by capital market conditions including prevailing interest rates given current capital market and real estate market conditions we are evaluating the appropriate allocation of capital investment among development and redevelopment communities the acquisition of existing communities and stock redemptionsrepurchases in addition we expect to increase disposition activity to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle as well as to provide additional liquidity see “liquidity and capital resources” and “future financing and capital needs” our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities communities in various stages of development and development rights ie land or land options held for development our current operating communities are further distinguished as established other stabilized leaseup and redevelopment a description of these categories and operating performance information can be found in note 9 “segment reporting” in our consolidated financial statements included in this report 38   on december 31 2002 we owned or had an ownership interest in these categories as follows  39   results of operations and funds from operations a comparison of our operating results for the years 2002 2001 and 2000 follows dollars in thousands  net income available to common stockholders decreased 60778000 281 to 155722000 in 2002 this decrease is primarily attributable to fewer gains on sales of communities in 2002 coupled with a decline in net operating income due to deteriorating market conditions in several of our principal markets and increases in interest and depreciation expenses net income available to common stockholders increased by 45675000 267 to 216500000 in 2001 due to additional net operating income from newly developed and redeveloped communities as well as growth in net operating income from established communities and increased gain on sale of communities 40   net operating income “noi” is calculated at the community level and represents total revenue less direct property operating expenses including property taxes and excludes property management and other indirect operating expenses interest expense depreciation expense general and administrative expense and impairment losses we believe that noi is an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand the recurring operations of our real estate portfolio as well as provide insight into how management evaluates operations on a segment basis noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs a calculation of noi along with a reconciliation to net income is provided in the preceding table the noi decrease of 17249000 for the year ended december 31 2002 and the increase of 48305000 for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories  the noi decrease in established communities in 2002 was largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets strong single family home sales partially fueled by a low mortgage rate environment in addition to continuing job losses in many of our submarkets have aggravated a weak demand environment causing market rental rates and occupancies to decline we currently expect to continue to experience weak demand during most of 2003 we also anticipate that any growth or improvement that we may experience in late 2003 will be at a slower rate than that experienced by the overall market and economy if any due to the types of industries technology telecom financial services that make up a large proportion of the jobs in our markets rental income increased due to rental income generated from acquired and newly developed communities offset by a decline in occupancies and effective rental rates for established communities  41    although most of our markets have experienced weak demand we have observed the most significant declines in average rental rates and occupancy during 2002 in certain northern california and northeast submarkets northern california which accounts for approximately 320 of current established community rental revenue experienced a decline in rental revenue in 2002 partially related to job losses in the technology sector although economic occupancy remained flat in northern california in 2002 as compared to 2001 average rental rates dropped 126 from 1788 to 1562 for those same periods the northeast region also accounts for approximately 320 of current established community rental revenue and has been experiencing a decline in rental revenue primarily the result of job losses in the financial services sector economic occupancy decreased in the northeast from 969 in 2001 to 926 for 2002 while average rental rates improved slightly during 2002 other income increased primarily due to the recognition of 5800000 and 2500000 in 2002 and 2001 respectively of business interruption insurance related to the settlement of a fire insurance claim that occurred during the construction of avalon at edgewater in addition we recognized 711000 in the first quarter of 2002 in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest direct property operating expenses excluding property taxes increased due to the addition of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment homes coupled with increased insurance marketing and bad debt insurance expense has increased over the past two years particularly during 2001 as the insurance and reinsurance markets deteriorated resulting in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector we renewed our general liability policy on august 1 2002 and our property coverage on november 1 2002 see “insurance and risk of uninsured losses” for a discussion of our insurance policies and related coverage insurance and other costs associated with development and redevelopment communities are expensed as communities move from the initial construction and leaseup phase to the stabilized operating phase marketing initiatives have been expanded in response to the weak demand and bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of continuing job losses and the weakened economy  property taxes increased due to higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes property taxes on development and redevelopment communities are capitalized while the community is under construction we begin to expense these costs as homes within the community receive a final certificate of occupancy  property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased in 2002 and increased in 2001 as a result of executive separation costs that were recognized in 2001 but not in 2002 or 2000 the decrease in 2002 is partially offset by increases in unallocated central marketing costs and abandoned pursuit costs similar to the community level central marketing initiatives have been expanded in response to the weak demand abandoned pursuit costs increased 600000 from 2200000 in 2001 to 2800000 in 2002 related to development rights which may not be developed as planned 42   interest expense increased in 2002 due to the issuance of 750000000 of unsecured notes between september 2001 and december 2002 partially offset by the repayment of 100000000 of unsecured notes in september 2002 and overall lower interest rates on both shortterm and longterm borrowings in addition higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility resulted in higher interest expense between years interest expense increased in 2001 due to the issuance of 650000000 of unsecured notes during 2000 and 2001 depreciation expense increased primarily related to acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities we expect depreciation expense to continue to increase as we complete additional development and redevelopment communities partially offset by the elimination of depreciation of communities that are sold or designated as held for sale during 2003  general and administrative expense decreased in 2002 and increased in 2001 as a result of additional compensation expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2001 due to the retirement of a senior executive unfilled positions and lower incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in 2002 impairment loss of 6800000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land parcels that as of december 31 2002 were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition this loss was recorded to reflect the parcels at fair market value based on their entitlement status as of december 31 2002 less estimated selling costs in february 2003 we won an appeal regarding the entitlement status of one of these parcels if we decide to continue with the planned disposition this change in entitlement status may increase the potential value of the land and therefore decrease the previously estimated loss that would be recognized at the date of disposal however we are currently reevaluating our plans for this parcel which may result in 2003 in the partial recovery of the impairment loss recognized in 2002 if we decide to hold the land for development equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased during 2002 primarily due to losses recorded for an investment in a technology company accounted for under the equity method during 2002 and 2001 we recorded losses of 3166000 and 1730000 respectively related to this investment bringing the carrying value of this investment to zero as of december 31 2002 in addition a 934000 valuation allowance was recorded during 2001 for an investment in a different technology company which contributed to the decrease in 2001 over the prior year period interest income during 2002 decreased due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates the increase in interest income during 2001 resulted from higher average cash balances invested gain on sale of communities  including discontinued operations of 48893000 62852000 and 40779000 were realized in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively these gains on the sale of communities are the result of our strategy to sell communities that do not meet our longterm strategic objectives and redeploy the proceeds to current development and redevelopment communities the amount of gains realized depend on many factors including the number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area in 2003 we expect to increase our disposition activity as compared to 2002 43   funds from operations we consider funds from operations “ffo” to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps investors understand our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures we believe that in order to understand our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report consistent with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts ®  we calculate ffo as  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance ffo should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs further ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo and a presentation of gaap based cash flow metrics dollars in thousands  capitalization of fixed assets and community improvements our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize only nonrecurring expenditures we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item  44   under this policy virtually all capitalized costs are nonrecurring as recurring makeready costs are expensed as incurred recurring makeready costs include the following  we capitalize purchases of personal property such as computers and furniture only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds 2500 we generally expense purchases of personal property made for replacement purposes for established and other stabilized communities we recorded nonrevenue generating capitalized expenditures of approximately 302 per apartment home in 2002 and 251 per apartment home in 2001 the average maintenance costs charged to expense including carpet and appliance replacements related to these communities was 1224 per apartment home in 2002 and 1196 in 2001 we anticipate that capitalized costs per apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities increases we expect expensed maintenance costs to increase as the average age of our communities increases and to fluctuate with changes in turnover we have expanded our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report to include additional information on capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to i acquisitions development and redevelopment were 457851000 and 401359000 respectively ii revenue generating expenditures such as water submetering equipment and cable installations were 697000 and 1675000 respectively and iii nonrevenue generating expenditures were 11375000 and 12234000 respectively liquidity and capital resources liquidity the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations operating cash flows have historically been determined by  the timing source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment particularly to changes in interest rates changes in the capital markets environment affect our plans for undertaking construction and development as well as acquisition and disposition activity cash and cash equivalents totaled 13357000 at december 31 2002 a decrease of 59633000 for the year the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report operating activities – net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 308109000 in 2002 from 320606000 in 2001 primarily due to the decline in operating income from established communities and the loss of operating income from communities sold during 2002 and 2001 partially offset by additional operating income from newly developed and redeveloped communities investing activities – net cash used in investing activities of 440331000 in 2002 related to investments in assets through development redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities partially offset by proceeds from the sales of apartment communities 45      financing activities – net cash provided by financing activities totaled 72589000 for the year ended december 31 2002 primarily due to the issuance of unsecured notes and an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility partially offset by dividends paid common stock repurchases and the redemption of the series c preferred stock see note 3 “notes payable unsecured notes and credit facility” and note 4 “stockholders’ equity” in our consolidated financial statements for additional information we regularly review our short and longterm liquidity needs the adequacy of funds from operations as defined above and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to fund  we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flows provided by operating activities proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under the unsecured credit facility one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and longterm debt at the time that such debt matures for unsecured notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity on january 15 2003 50000000 in unsecured notes matured and was paid including the balance of accrued interest during the remainder of 2003 we have 46   100000000 in maturing unsecured notes if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness it will be necessary for us to refinance this debt this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities draws on our credit facility or by additional equity offerings we also anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that when a debt obligation matures some or all of each maturity can be satisfied from this retained cash although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our longterm liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory capital resources we intend to match the longterm nature of our real estate assets with longterm costeffective capital to the extent permitted by prevailing market conditions from january 1 2000 through february 1 2003 we issued 1100000000 of unsecured notes through public offerings we expect this source of capital together with cash flow from operating activities dispositions and other sources of capital to remain available to meet our capital needs for the foreseeable future although no assurance can be provided that the debt capital markets will remain available or that such debt will be available on attractive terms variable rate unsecured credit facility our unsecured revolving credit facility is furnished by a syndicate of banks and provides up to 500000000 in shortterm credit under the terms of the credit facility if we elect to increase the facility up to 650000000 and one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment then we will be able to increase the facility up to 650000000 and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds we pay participating banks in the aggregate an annual facility fee of 750000 in equal quarterly installments the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the current stated pricing is libor plus 060 per annum 194 on february 28 2003 pricing could vary if there is a change in rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies a change in rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 005 to 015 a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 400000000 this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow pricing under the competitive bid option resulted in average pricing of libor plus 034 for amounts most recently borrowed under the competitive bid option the existing facility matures in may 2005 assuming exercise of a oneyear renewal at our option at february 28 2003 155470000 was outstanding 15529000 was used to provide letters of credit and 329001000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility interest rate protection agreements we are not a party to any longterm interest rate agreements other than interest rate protection and swap agreements on approximately 166000000 of our variable rate taxexempt indebtedness we intend however to evaluate the need for longterm interest rate protection agreements as interest rate market conditions dictate and we have engaged a consultant to assist in managing our interest rate risks and exposure future financing and capital needs as of december 31 2002 we had 12 new communities under construction for which a total estimated cost of 254146000 remained to be invested in addition we had two communities under reconstruction for which a total estimated cost of 7656000 remained to be invested 47   substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction will be funded from  we expect to continue to fund development costs related to pursuing development rights from retained operating cash and borrowings under the unsecured credit facility we believe these sources of capital will be adequate to take the proposed communities to the point in the development cycle where construction can begin before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to abandon development rights writeoff associated pursuit costs that were capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such pursuits our liquidity could be adversely impacted by expanding development and acquisition activities andor reduced capital as compared to prior years available from asset sales to meet the balance of our liquidity needs under such conditions we would need to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility sell additional existing communities andor issue additional debt or equity securities while we believe we have the financial position to expand our shortterm credit capacity and support our capital markets activity we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements sales or offerings the failure to complete these transactions on a costeffective basis could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition including the abandonment of development pursuits it is our policy to sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment criteria when market conditions are favorable and to redeploy the proceeds when we decide to sell a community we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and tax ramifications of each proposal we intend to actively seek buyers for communities that we determine to hold for sale we expect to accelerate our disposition program during 2003 in response to current and anticipated real estate and capital markets conditions however we cannot assure you that assets can be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets the immediate effect of a sale of a community is to reduce total revenues total expenses and funds from operations therefore an acceleration of our disposition program in 2003 may adversely impact total revenues and funds from operations as of february 28 2003 we have six communities classified as held for sale under gaap we are actively pursuing the disposition of these communities and expect to close during the first and second quarters of 2003 however we cannot assure you that these communities will be sold as planned we have minority interest investments in three technology companies including constellation real technologies llc “constellation” an entity formed by a number of real estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of investing in multisector real estate technology opportunities our original commitment to constellation was 4000000 but as a result of an agreement among the members reducing the commitment due from each member our commitment is currently 2600000 of which we have contributed 959000 to date the remaining unfunded commitment of 1641000 is expected to be funded over the next five years in january 2002 we invested an additional 2300000 in realeum inc “realeum” a company involved in the development and deployment of a property management and leasing automation system pursuant to an agreement with realeum we utilize the property management and leasing automation system in exchange for payments under a licensing 48   arrangement realeum is negotiating licensing arrangements with other real estate companies that we are unaffiliated with if unsuccessful in negotiating additional licensing agreements realeum may be required to obtain additional sources of funding our third technology investment is in rentcom an internetbased rental housing information provider we have no obligation to contribute additional funds to these technology investments other than the commitment to constellation as previously described debt maturities the following table details debt maturities for the next five years excluding the unsecured credit facility for debt outstanding at december 31 2002 dollars in thousands  additional columns below continued from above table first columns repeated   49   stock repurchase program in july 2002 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a common stock repurchase program under this program we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of 100000000 actual purchases of stock will vary with market conditions the size of the stock repurchase program was designed so that retained cash flow as well as the proceeds from sales of existing apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions will provide the source of funding for the program with our unsecured credit facility providing temporary funding as needed through february 28 2003 we have acquired 2042600 shares at an aggregate cost of 77381000 under this program redemption of preferred stock in july 2002 we redeemed all 2300000 outstanding shares of our 850 series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of 2500 per share plus 01417 in accrued and unpaid dividends for an aggregate redemption price of 57826000 including accrued dividends of 326000 the redemption price was funded in part by the sale on july 11 2002 of 592000 shares of series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a net purchase price of 14504000 the dividend rate on such shares was initially equal to 336 per annum three month libor plus 15 of the liquidation preference as permitted under the terms of such preferred stock we redeemed all of the series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock on august 29 2002 for an aggregate redemption price of 14609000 including accrued dividends of 68000 as of february 1 2003 we have the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at an aggregate stated value of 181692500 these series have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions as these series become redeemable we will evaluate the requirements necessary for such redemptions as well as the costeffectiveness based on the existing market conditions  on february 18 2003 we gave notice of our intent to redeem all 3267700 outstanding shares of our 800 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock we anticipate closing this redemption on march 20 2003 at a price of 2500 per share plus 00167 in accrued and unpaid dividends for an aggregate redemption price of 81747000 including accrued dividends of 55000 this redemption will be funded by the sale of shares of series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock through a private placement to an institutional investor the dividend rate on such shares will initially be based on three month libor plus 15 the series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock will be redeemable at any time at our option 50   inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less in the event of significant inflation this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents in a deflationary rent environment as is currently being experienced we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorterterm leases critical accounting policies our accounting policies are in conformity with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies which we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain additional discussion of accounting policies which we consider significant including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements real estate development rights we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable these costs include legal fees design fees and related overhead costs the accompanying consolidated financial statements include a charge to expense to provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable capitalized predevelopment costs the determination of the charge to expense involves management judgement regarding the probability that a pursuit will not proceed to development revenue recognition rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” in accordance with our standard lease terms rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease – generally one year real estate if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the community if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the community we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value 51   discontinued operations on january 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been sold during 2002 or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of december 31 2002 be presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in both current and prior periods presented the community specific components of net income that are presented as discontinued operations include net operating income depreciation and interest expense in addition the net gain or loss including any impairment loss on the eventual disposal of communities held for sale is presented as discontinued operations when recognized real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell and are presented separately in our consolidated balance sheets subsequent to classification of a community as held for sale no further depreciation is recorded on the assets investments in technology companies we account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment our policy is to record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value a loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment due to the nature of these investments an impairment in value can be difficult to determine stockbased compensation during the periods presented in this report we applied apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options no stockbased employee compensation cost is reflected in net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant see note 10 “stockbased compensation plans” in our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to stockbased employee compensation legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business these matters are frequently covered by insurance while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or the results of operations once it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates we had 52   173840000 and 125274000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2002 and 2001 our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately 2557000 and 1500000 respectively based on balances outstanding during the applicable years we currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness under swap agreements  as of december 31 2002 the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately 166000000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt furthermore a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately 22500000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt exists as of december 31 2002 the swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate taxexempt debt were not electively entered into by us but rather were a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our taxexempt bond financings because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard  poor’s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 53

item 1         business

general

avalonbay is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real
estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we focus on
the ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities which generally
command among the highest rents in their submarkets in high barriertoentry
markets of the united states this is because we believe that over the long
term the limited new supply of upscale apartment homes in these markets will
result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets these
barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process
with local jurisdictions and dense infill locations where zoned and entitled
land is in limited supply our markets are located in the northeast
midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern california
regions of the united states we believe that we have penetrated substantially
all of the high barriertoentry markets of the country

as of march 1 2002 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in
126 operating apartment communities containing 37228 apartment homes in eleven
states and the district of columbia of which three communities containing 1896
apartment homes were under redevelopment in addition to these operating
communities we also owned 15 communities under construction that will contain
3963 apartment homes and rights to develop an additional 30 communities that
if developed as expected will contain an estimated 8918 apartment homes we
generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new
community on vacant land or by acquiring and either repositioning or
redeveloping an existing community in selecting sites for development
redevelopment or acquisition we favor locations that are near expanding
employment centers and convenient to recreation areas entertainment shopping
and dining

our real estate investments consist of established communities other stabilized
communities development communities and redevelopment communities a
description of these segments and other related information can be found in note
9 of the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this report

our principal operating objectives are to develop own and operate in our
selected markets high quality upscale communities that contain features and
amenities desired by prospective residents and to provide our residents with
efficient and effective service our principal financial goals are to
successfully implement those operating objectives in a cost effective manner and
thereby increase longterm stockholder value by increasing operating cash flow
and funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate
investment trusts for a description of the meaning of funds from operations
and its use and limitation as an operating measure see the discussion titled
funds from operations in item 7 of this report our strategies and goals to
achieve these objectives include

           generating consistent sustained earnings growth at each community
            through increased revenue by balancing high occupancy with premium
            pricing and increased operating margins from operating expense
            management

           investing selectively in new development redevelopment and
            acquisition communities in markets with growing or high potential
            for demand and high barrierstoentry

           selling communities in markets where we seek to adjust our market
            penetration and

           maintaining a conservative capital structure to provide continuous
            access to costeffective capital

we believe that we can generally implement these strategies best by developing
redeveloping acquiring and managing upscale assets in supplyconstrained
markets while maintaining the financial discipline to ensure balance sheet
flexibility



                                       1

development strategy we carefully select land for development and follow
established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of
development as one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment
communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states we identify
development opportunities through local market presence and access to local
market information achieved through our regional offices in addition to our
principal executive offices in alexandria virginia we also maintain regional
offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following cities

           boston massachusetts

           chicago illinois

           newport beach california

           new york new york

           san jose california

           wilton connecticut

           woodbridge new jersey and

           seattle washington

after selecting a target site we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the
site either through an option or a longterm conditional contract options and
longterm conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target site
shortly before the start of construction which reduces developmentrelated
risks as well as preserves capital after we acquire land we generally shift
our focus to construction except for certain midrise and highrise apartment
communities where we may elect to use thirdparty general contractors or
construction managers we act as our own general contractor and construction
manager we believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality
greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings our
development and property management teams monitor construction progress to
ensure high quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the
leasing and operational phase

redevelopment strategy when we undertake the redevelopment of a community our
goal is to generally renovate andor rebuild an existing community so that our
total investment is significantly below replacement cost and the community is
the highest quality apartment community or best rental value for an upscale
apartment community in its local area we have established procedures to
minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment our redevelopment teams
which include key redevelopment construction and property management personnel
monitor redevelopment progress we believe we achieve significant cost savings
by acting as our own general contractor more importantly this helps to ensure
high quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the
leaseup and restabilization phase

disposition strategy to optimize our concentration of communities in selected
high barriertoentry markets we sell assets that do not meet our longterm
investment criteria when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the
proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities under
construction or reconstruction this disposition strategy acts as a source of
capital because we are able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions
in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally when we decide to sell a
community we solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual
assets and consider the sales price and tax ramifications of each proposal in
connection with this disposition program we disposed of a total of seven
communities since january 1 2001 the net proceeds from the sale of these
assets were approximately 239000000 however we cannot provide assurance
that we will be able to continue our current disposition strategy or that assets
we identify for sale can be sold on terms that are satisfactory to us for 2002
we plan to significantly curtail disposition activity in response to the current
capital and real estate markets

acquisition strategy our core competencies in development and redevelopment
discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target between
january 1 2001 and march 1 2002 we acquired three communities containing 995
apartment homes these communities were acquired in connection with a forward
purchase contract agreed to in 1997 this expansion is consistent with our
strategy to achieve longterm earnings growth by providing a high quality
platform for expansion while also providing additional economic and geographic
diversity the acquisition of these presale communities was designed to achieve
rapid penetration into markets that are generally



                                       2
page

supply constrained and in which we had no significant presence we have one
presale commitment provided for under a separate agreement which is expected to
close in the second quarter of 2002

property management strategy we intend to increase operating income through
innovative proactive property management that will result in higher revenue
with controlled operating expenses from communities

our principle strategies to maximize revenue include

           strong focus on resident satisfaction

           staggering lease terms based on vacancy exposure by apartment type
            so that lease expirations are better matched to each communitys
            traffic patterns

           increasing rents as market conditions permit

           managing community occupancy for optimal rental revenue levels and

           applying new technology to optimize revenue from each community

controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase
earnings growth growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue
allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue
thereby increasing operating margins we aggressively pursue real estate tax
appeals and control operating expenses as follows

           record invoices onsite to ensure careful monitoring of budgeted
            versus actual expenses

           purchase supplies in bulk where possible

           bid thirdparty contracts on a volume basis

           strive to retain residents through high levels of service in order
            to eliminate the cost of preparing an apartment home for a new
            resident and to reduce marketing and vacant apartment utility costs

           perform turnover work inhouse or hire thirdparties generally
            depending upon the least costly alternative and

           undertake preventive maintenance regularly to maximize resident
            satisfaction and property and equipment life

onsite property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net
operating income produced at their respective communities we are also pursuing
ancillary services which could provide additional revenue sources on a limited
basis we also manage properties for third parties believing that doing so will
provide information about new markets or provide an acquisition opportunity
thereby enhancing opportunities for growth

technology strategy we believe that an innovative management information system
infrastructure will be an important element in managing our future growth this
is because timely and accurate collection of financial and resident profile data
will enable us to maximize revenue through careful leasing decisions and
financial management we currently employ a companywide intranet using a
digital network with highspeed digital lines this network connects all of our
communities and offices to central servers in alexandria virginia providing
access to our associates and to avalonbays corporate information throughout the
country from all locations

we have invested in five technology companies in the belief that the development
and application of their technology and services will improve the operating
performance of our real estate holdings our most significant technology
investment is in realeum inc realeum is engaged in the development of an
onsite property management system and leasing automation system to enable
management to capture review and analyze data to a greater extent than is
possible using existing commercial software to help monitor this investment
thomas j sargeant our executive vice president and chief financial officer is
a director of realeum we are also a member of constellation real technologies
llc an entity formed by a number of real estate investment trusts and real
estate operating companies for the purpose of investing in multisector real
estate technology opportunities our original commitment to constellation was
4000000 and we have contributed 959000 to date constellation has proposed
a reduction in the aggregate amount of capital commitments from its members if
that proposal is accepted our revised commitment would fall to 2600000 the
aggregate carrying value of all of our technology investments including realeum
and constellation at march 1 2002 was 4800000

financing strategy we have consistently maintained and intend to continue to
maintain a conservative capital structure largely comprised of common equity
at december 31 2001 our debttototal market capitalization ie the
aggregate of the market value of common stock the liquidation preference of
preferred stock and the principle amount of debt was 371 and our permanent
longterm floating rate debt not including borrowings under the unsecured
credit facility was only 12 of total market capitalization

before planned construction or reconstruction activity begins we intend to
arrange adequate capital sources to complete such undertakings although we
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing during 2001
substantially all of our construction and reconstruction activities were funded
by issuance of unsecured debt securities asset sales through nontaxable
likekind exchanges and retained operating cash in the event that financing
cannot be obtained we may have to abandon planned development activities
writeoff associated pursuit costs andor forego reconstruction activity in
such instances we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we
expected from such pursuits and the related writeoff of costs will increase
current period expenses

we estimate that a portion of our shortterm liquidity needs will be met from
retained operating cash and borrowings under our 500000000 variable rate
unsecured credit facility at march 1 2002 zero was outstanding 85820000
was used to provide letters of credit and 414180000 was available for
borrowing under the unsecured credit facility

if required to meet the balance of our liquidity needs we will need to arrange
additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility sell
additional existing communities andor issue additional debt or equity
securities while we believe we have the financial position to expand our
shortterm credit capacity and access the capital markets as needed we cannot
assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements sales or
offerings the failure to complete these transactions on a costeffective basis
could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial
condition including the abandonment of deferred development costs and a
resultant charge to earnings

inflation and tax matters

substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may
enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the
beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to
us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases
permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our
current policy is generally to permit residents to terminate leases upon an
agreed advance written notice and a lease termination payment as provided for
in the residents lease shortterm leases combined with relatively consistent
demand have allowed rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to
provide an attractive inflation hedge

we filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as a
reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and intend to maintain
our qualification as a reit in the future as a qualified reit with limited
exceptions we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws
at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed
to our stockholders we expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income
tax at the corporate level

environmental matters

under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and
regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
required in many instances regardless of knowledge or responsibility to
investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum product releases at such property the owner or operator may be held
liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for
investigation and remediation costs incurred by such parties in connection with
the contamination which may be substantial the presence of such substances or
the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect the
owners ability to borrow against sell or rent such property in addition some
environmental



                                       4

laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for
damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination

certain federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances govern the
removal encapsulation or disturbance of asbestoscontaining materials or acms
when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction
remodeling renovation or demolition of a building such laws may impose
liability for release of acms and may provide for third parties to seek recovery
from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with
acms in connection with our ownership and operation of apartment communities
we potentially may be liable for such costs we are not aware that any acms were
used in connection with the construction of the communities developed by us
however we are aware that acms were used in connection with the construction of
certain communities acquired by us we do not anticipate that we will incur any
material liabilities in connection with the presence of acms at these
communities we currently have an operations and maintenance program for acms at
each of the communities at which acms have been detected

when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold
growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or
is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce toxins or
irritants concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure
to mold may cause a variety of health effects and symptoms including allergic
or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold at a community
owned by us could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to
contain or remove the mold from the affected community in addition the
presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from residents and
others if property damage or health concerns arise

we are also aware that certain communities have lead paint and we are
undertaking or intend to undertake appropriate remediation

all of our stabilized operating communities and all of the communities that we
are currently developing or redeveloping have been subjected to at least a
phase i or similar environmental assessment which generally does not involve
invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling these assessments
have not revealed any environmental conditions that we believe will have a
material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results
of operations we are not aware of any other environmental conditions which
would have such a material adverse effect

however we are aware that the migration of contamination from an upgradient
landowner near a community owned by us avalon at silicon valley formerly known
as toscana has affected the groundwater there the upgradient landowner is
undertaking remedial response actions and a ground water treatment system has
been installed we expect that the upgradient landowner will take all necessary
remediation actions and ensure the ongoing operation and maintenance of the
ground water treatment system the upgradient landowner has also provided an
indemnity that runs to current and future owners of the property and upon which
we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the groundwater
contamination

additionally prior to 1994 we had occasionally been involved in developing
managing leasing and operating various properties for third parties
consequently we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties
and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other
potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances we are not
aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties that
we managed or developed for such third parties

we cannot provide assurance that

           the environmental assessments identified all potential environmental
            liabilities

           no prior owner created any material environmental condition not
            known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments

           no environmental liabilities developed since such environmental
            assessments were prepared

           the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our
            communities such as the presence of underground storage tanks will
            not affect the environmental condition of such communities

           future uses or conditions including without limitation changes in
            applicable environmental laws and regulations will not result in
            the imposition of environmental liability or

           no environmental liabilities will develop at communities that have
            been sold pursuant to our disposition strategy for which we may have
            liability

item 2         communities

our real estate investments consist of current operating apartment communities
communities in various stages of development and land or land options held for
development the following is a description of each category

current communities are categorized as established other stabilized leaseup
or redevelopment according to the following

       established communities also known as same store communities are
        communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year
        to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and
        had stabilized operating costs as of the beginning of the prior year we
        determine which of our communities fall into the established communities
        category annually on january 1 of each year and maintain that
        classification throughout the year for the year 2001 the established
        communities were communities that had stabilized operating costs as of
        january 1 2000

       other stabilized communities are all other completed communities that
        have stabilized occupancy and are not undergoing or planning
        redevelopment activities we consider a community to have stabilized
        occupancy at the earlier of i attainment of 95 occupancy or ii the
        oneyear anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment for
        the year 2001 other stabilized communities therefore include
        communities that were either acquired or achieved stabilization after
        january 1 2000 and that were not undergoing or planning redevelopment
        activities

       leaseup communities are communities where construction has been
        complete for less than one year and where occupancy has not reached 95

       redevelopment communities are communities where substantial
        redevelopment is in progress or is planned to take place during the
        current year redevelopment is considered substantial when capital
        invested during the reconstruction effort exceeds the lesser of
        5000000 or 10 of the communitys acquisition cost

development communities are communities that are under construction and for
which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received these communities
may be partially complete and operating

development rights are development opportunities in the early phase of the
development process for which we have an option to acquire land a leasehold
interest for which we are the buyer under a longterm conditional contract to
purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community we capitalize all
related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of these new developments

our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following
pages

the current communities are primarily gardenstyle apartment communities
consisting of two and threestory buildings in landscaped settings the current
communities as of march 1 2002 include 100 gardenstyle 15 highrise and 11
midrise apartment communities the current communities offer many attractive
amenities including some or all of the following

           vaulted ceilings

           lofts

           fireplaces

           patiosdecks and

           business centers


we also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all
communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and
where vacant available for immediate occupancy we believe that

the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property
management team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market
appeal to discriminating residents we believe this will ultimately achieve
higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and
operating expenses these current communities are located in the following

of the current communities as of march 1 2002 we own

           a fee simple or absolute ownership interest in 103 operating
            communities one of which is on land subject to a 149 year land
            lease

           a general partnership interest in four partnerships that each own a
            fee simple interest in an operating community

           a general partnership interest in four partnerships structured as
            downreits as described more fully below that own an aggregate of
            17 communities

           a 100 interest in a senior participating mortgage note secured by
            one community which allows us to share in part of the rental income
            or resale proceeds of the community and

           a membership interest in a limited liability company that holds a
            fee simple interest in one redevelopment community

we also hold a fee simple ownership interest in eleven of the development
communities and a membership interest in a limited liability company that holds
a fee simple interest in one development community

in each of the four partnerships structured as downreits either we or one of
our whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are one or more
limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of
limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited partners
are entitled to receive distributions before any distribution is made to the
general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the downreits
are different generally the distributions paid to the holders of units of
limited partnership interests approximate the current avalonbay common stock
dividend amount each downreit partnership has been structured so that it is
unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than
the initial distribution provided for in the partnership agreement the holders
of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present each unit of
limited partnership interest for redemption for cash equal to the fair market
value of a share of our common stock on the date of redemption in lieu of cash
we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our
common stock as of december 31 2001 there were 905946 units outstanding the
downreit partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes

development communities

as of march 1 2002 we had 15 development communities under construction we
expect these development communities when completed to add a total of 3963
apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost including land
acquisition costs of approximately 750300000 statements regarding the
future development or performance of the development communities are
forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that

           we will complete the development communities

           our budgeted costs or estimates of occupancy rates will be realized

           our schedule of leasing start dates or construction completion dates
            will be achieved or

          future developments will realize returns comparable to our past
           developments

you should carefully review the discussion under risks of development and
redevelopment included elsewhere in this item 2

4  the land for this community is currently owned by a limited partnership in
     which we are a majority partner it is currently anticipated that the land
     seller will retain a minority limited partner interest the budgeted cost
     reflected above excludes construction and management fees due to avalonbay

5  the total budgeted cost for this community excludes approximately 4
     million of proceeds that the company estimates it will receive upon a sale
     of transferable development rights associated with the development of the
     community these rights do not become transferable until construction
     completion and there can be no assurance that the projected amount of
     proceeds will be achieved

redevelopment communities

as of march 1 2002 we had three communities under redevelopment we expect the
total budgeted cost to complete these redevelopment communities including the
cost of acquisition and redevelopment to be approximately 290800000 of
which approximately 64100000 is the additional capital invested or expected
to be invested above the original purchase cost statements regarding the future
redevelopment or performance of the redevelopment communities are
forwardlooking statements we have found that the cost to redevelop an existing
apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to
develop a new community accordingly we expect that actual costs may vary from
our budget by a wider range than for a new development community we cannot
assure you that we will meet our schedules for reconstruction completion or
that we will meet our budgeted costs either individually or in the aggregate
see the discussion under risks of development and redevelopment indcluded
elsewhere in this item 2

the following presents a summary of redevelopment communities

development rights

as of march 1 2002 we are considering the development of 30 new apartment
communities on land that is either owned by us under contract subject to a
leasehold interest or for which we hold a purchase option these development
rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those
that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost
immediately we estimate that the successful completion of all of these
communities would ultimately add 8918 upscale apartment homes to our portfolio
at december 31 2001 the cumulative capitalized costs incurred in pursuit of
the 30 development rights was approximately 29800000 net of land acquisition
costs associated with nine of the development rights substantially all of these
apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we
currently own

we generally hold development rights through options to acquire land the
properties comprising the development rights are in different stages of the due
diligence and regulatory approval process the decisions as to which of the
development rights to pursue if any or to continue to pursue once an
investment in a development right is made are business judgments that we make
after we perform financial demographic and other analyses finally we
currently intend to limit the percentage of debt used to finance new
developments in order to maintain our general historical practice with respect
to the proportion of debt in our capital structure therefore other financing
alternatives may be required to finance the development of those development
rights scheduled to start construction after january 1 2002 although the
development of any particular development right cannot be



                                       24

assured we believe that the development rights in the aggregate present
attractive potential opportunities for future development and growth of our
longterm stockholder value

statements regarding the future development of the development rights are
forwardlooking statements we cannot assure you that

           we will succeed in obtaining zoning and other necessary governmental
            approvals or the financing required to develop these communities or
            that we will decide to develop any particular community or

           if we undertake construction of any particular community that we
            will complete construction at the total budgeted cost assumed in the
            financial projections below

pursuing

risks of development and redevelopment

we intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment
home communities our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed to
the following

           we may abandon opportunities we have already begun to explore based
            on further review of or changes in financial demographic
            environmental or other factors

           we may encounter liquidity constraints including the unavailability
            of financing on favorable terms for the development or redevelopment
            of a community

           we may be unable to obtain or we may experience delays in
            obtaining all necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and
            other required governmental permits and authorizations

           we may incur construction or reconstruction costs for a community
            that exceed our original estimates due to increased materials labor
            or other expenses which could make completion or redevelopment of
            the community uneconomical

           occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed or redevelopment
            community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including
            market and general economic conditions and may not be sufficient to
            make the community profitable and

           we may be unable to complete construction and leaseup on schedule
            resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs

the occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect our
ability to achieve our projected yields on communities under development or
redevelopment and could affect our payment of distributions to our stockholders

construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in
the communitys market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes
to those market conditions that we anticipated at that time although we attempt
to anticipate changes in market conditions we cannot predict with certainty
what those changes will be construction costs have been increasing and for
some of our development communities the total construction costs have been or
are expected to be higher than the original budget total budgeted cost includes
all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective
development or redevelopment community including

           land andor property acquisition costs

           construction or reconstruction costs

           real estate taxes

           capitalized interest

           loan fees

           permits

           professional fees

           allocated development or redevelopment overhead and

           other regulatory fees determined in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles

we believe that in the aggregate we will still achieve our targeted projected
yield ie return on invested capital for those communities experiencing
costs in excess of the original budget because of increases in prevailing market
rents costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have in some
cases exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be
experienced in the future we cannot assure you that market rents in effect at
the time new development communities or redeveloped communities complete
leaseup will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased
construction or reconstruction costs



                                       26

capitalized interest

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we capitalize
interest expense during construction or reconstruction until a community or
portion of a community obtains a certificate of occupancy thereafter the
interest allocated to that community or portion of a community is expensed
capitalized interest during the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 totaled
27635000 and 18328000 respectively

acquisition activities and other recent developments

acquisitions of existing communities we have acquired three communities
containing 995 apartment homes since january 1 2001 for an acquisition price of
approximately 129300000 each of these communities was acquired pursuant to a
forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997 with an unaffiliated party

one downreit partnership was formed since january 1 2001 in conjunction with
the acquisition of land by that partnership

sales of existing communities we seek to increase our geographical
concentration in selected high barriertoentry markets where we believe we can

           apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue
            growth

           reduce operating expenses and

           leverage management talent

to achieve this increased concentration we sell assets that do not meet our
long term investment criteria and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to
develop and redevelop communities pending such redeployment we will generally
use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts
outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility on occasion we
will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow
account to facilitate a nontaxable likekind exchange transaction accordingly
we sold seven communities totaling 2551 apartment homes since january 1
2001 net proceeds from the sales of these assets totaled 230400000

land acquisitions and leases for new developments we carefully select land for
development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the
cost and the risks of development during 2001 we acquired the following land
parcels for future development

     of avalon madison until economic conditions improve

natural disasters

many of our west coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active
earthquake faults a large concentration of avalonbay communities lies near and
thus is susceptible to the major fault lines in the san francisco bay area
including the san andreas fault and hayward fault we cannot assure you that an
earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels

in november 2001 we renewed our earthquake insurance for any single
occurrence and in the aggregate we have in place with respect to communities
located in california 67000000 of coverage with a deductible per building
equal to five percent of the value of that building the five percent deductible
is subject to a minimum of 100000 per occurrence earthquake coverage outside
of california with the exception of washington state is subject to a
100000000 limit and a 100000 deductible per location in addition up to an
aggregate of 2000000 the next 400000 of loss per occurrence will be
treated as an additional deductible coverage in washington state is subject to
a 65000000 limit with the same deductible our general liability and
property insurance program provides coverage for public liability and fire
damage in the event an uninsured disaster or a loss in excess of insured limits
were to occur we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as
well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue
to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related
to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our
business and our financial condition and results of operations

americans with disabilities act

the apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire
must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act to the extent
that such properties are public accommodations andor commercial facilities
as defined by the americans with disabilities act compliance with the americans
with disabilities act requirements could require removal of structural barriers
to handicapped access in certain public areas of our properties



                                       28

where such removal is readily achievable the americans with disabilities act
does not however consider residential properties such as apartment
communities to be public accommodations or commercial facilities except to the
extent portions of such facilities such as leasing offices are open to the
public we believe our properties comply in all material respects with all
present requirements under the americans with disabilities act and applicable
state laws noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of
damages to private litigants












item 3         legal proceedings

avalonbay is from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business some of these claims and proceedings
are expected to be covered by liability insurance the following matter for
which we believe we have meritorious defenses and are therefore vigorously
defending against is not covered by liability insurance however outstanding
litigation matters individually and in the aggregate including the matter
described below are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our
business or financial condition

avalonbay is currently involved in litigation with york hunter construction
inc and national union fire insurance company the action arises from our
october 1999 termination of york hunter as construction manager under a contract
relating to construction of the avalon willow community in mamaroneck new york
because of alleged failures and deficiencies by york hunter and its
subcontractors in performing under the contract york hunter initiated the
litigation in october 1999 by filing a complaint against us and other defendants
claiming more than 15000000 in damages we have filed counterclaims against
york hunter seeking more than 9000000 in compensatory damages including lost
rental income and costs to complete the community we have also filed a claim
against national union fire insurance which furnished construction and
performance bonds to us on behalf of york hunter we believe that we have
meritorious defenses against all of york hunters claims and are vigorously
contesting those claims we also intend to pursue our counterclaims against york
hunter and national union fire insurance aggressively the litigation is pending
in the supreme court of the state of new york county of westchester a trial
date has not been set

forwardlooking statements

this form 10k including the footnotes to our consolidated financial
statements which immediately follows contains forwardlooking statements as
that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of
1995 you can identify forwardlooking statements by our use of the words
believe expect anticipate intend estimate assume project
and other similar expressions in this form 10k that predict or indicate
future events and trends or that do not report historical matters in
addition information concerning the following are forwardlooking statements

          the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under
           construction reconstruction development or redevelopment

          the timing of leaseup and occupancy of apartment communities

          the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development

          cost yield and earnings estimates and

          the development of management information systems by companies in
           which we have an investment and our implementation and use of those
           systems

we cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in
these statements rather these statements merely reflect our current
expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed you should
not rely on forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown
risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control
these risks uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results
performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future
results performance or achievements expressed or implied by these
forwardlooking statements some of the factors that could cause our actual
results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed
or implied by these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited
to the following

          we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability
           to reach agreements with third parties or to obtain desired zoning
           and other local approvals

          we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of
           reasons including changes in local market conditions which make
           development less desirable increases in costs of development and
           increases in the cost of capital

          construction costs of a community may exceed our original
           estimates

          we may not complete construction and leaseup of communities under
           development or redevelopment on schedule resulting in increased
           interest expense and construction costs and reduced rental
           revenues

          occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by local
           economic and market conditions which are beyond our control

          financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and
           our cash flow from operations and access to cost effective capital
           may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline and could
           limit our pursuit of opportunities

          our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of
           principal and interest and we may be unable to refinance existing
           indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as
           favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness

          we may be unsuccessful in managing our current growth in the number
           of apartment communities and

                                      34

          software applications and ancillary services being developed by
           companies in which we have invested may be unsuccessful in
           achieving their business plans or unsuccessful in obtaining
           additional funding which could lead to a partial or complete loss
           of our investment in these companies

you should read our consolidated financial statements and notes included in
this report in conjunction with the following discussion these
forwardlooking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of

statements and you should not rely upon them after the date of this report

business description and community information

avalonbay is a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real
estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes we focus on
the ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities which generally
command among the highest rents in their submarkets in high barriertoentry
markets of the united states this is because we believe that long term the
limited new supply of upscale apartment homes in these markets will result in
larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets these
barrierstoentry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement
process with local jurisdictions and dense infill locations where zoned and
entitled land is in limited supply these markets are located in the
northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and northern and southern
california regions of the united states

we are a fullyintegrated real estate organization with inhouse expertise in
the following areas

          development and redevelopment

          construction and reconstruction

          leasing and management

          acquisition and disposition

          financing

          marketing and

          information technologies

we believe apartment communities present an attractive investment opportunity
compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident
base results in relatively stable demand during all phases of a real estate
cycle with our expertise and inhouse capabilities we believe we are
wellpositioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop and acquire
upscale apartment homes in our target markets our ability to identify or
pursue attractive opportunities however is affected by capital market
conditions including prevailing interest rates and by the availability of
attractively priced opportunities given current capital market and real
estate market conditions we are carefully considering the appropriate
allocation of capital investment among development and redevelopment
communities as well as the acquisition of established communities we intend
to pursue these investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist
and where new household formations have outpaced multifamily permit activity
in recent years

our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment
communities communities in various stages of development and development
rights ie land or land options held for development our current
operating communities are further distinguished as established other
stabilized and redevelopment a description of these categories and operating
performance information can be found in note 9 segment reporting in our
consolidated financial statements included in this report

net income available to common stockholders increases in 2001 and 2000 over
the prior years are primarily attributable to gain on sale of communities
additional net operating income from newly developed and redeveloped
communities as well as growth in operating income from established
communities net operating income from newly developed and redeveloped
communities exceeded the corresponding cost of capital primarily debt used
to develop or redevelop these communities

during each of the last three years we have funded a portion of our
development and redevelopment activities through the sale of assets that did
not meet our longterm investment criteria the shortterm effect of a sale of
a community is that net operating income will be negatively impacted because
that communitys contribution to net operating income has been eliminated and
the development or redevelopment community in which the proceeds from the sale
are being invested is not yet complete there will also be less interest
expense than would otherwise be incurred as the proceeds from the sale of
communities are initially used to repay amounts outstanding on our unsecured
credit facility we believe that once stabilized the net operating income
generated by the newly developed and redeveloped communities will be higher
than the net operating income from the assets sold

net operating income increases generated in 2001 and 2000 over the prior years
resulted from changes in the following categories

these net operating income increases were largely due to the relatively high
occupancy and market rents experienced in 2000 which were carried into 2001
as we begin to experience the full effects of the recession we expect net
operating income from established communities to decline during the first half
of 2002 while total net operating income will increase modestly if the
economy recovers as anticipated in the second half of 2002 we expect to
experience modest net operating income growth from established communities
during that period

rental income increases in 2001 and 2000 over the prior year are primarily due
to an increase in the weighted average monthly rental income per occupied
apartment home and an increase in the weighted average number of occupied
apartment homes

    overall portfolio  the weighted average number of occupied apartment
    homes increased to 34417 apartment homes for 2001 compared to 33976
    apartment homes for 2000 and 33726 in 1999 these changes are primarily
    the result of development redevelopment and acquisition of new
    communities partially offset by i the sale of communities and ii for
    2001 occupancy declines related to the national recession and softening
    conditions in certain of our markets the weighted average monthly revenue
    per occupied apartment home increased to 1543 in 2001 compared to 1402
    in 2000 and 1242 in 1999 monthly revenue per occupied apartment home
    and occupancy levels may decline in 2002 as our portfolio is affected by
    the national recession

    established communities  rental revenue increased 26268000 66 in
    2001 and 25911000 89 in 2000 the increase in 2001 is due to market
    conditions during the past year that allowed for higher average rents
    partially offset by lower economic occupancy levels economic occupancy
    takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and
    locations have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue
    and measures the percentage impact on gross revenue that the vacant
    apartments would have if the community were otherwise fully leased at
    current market rents for 2001 the weighted average monthly revenue per
    occupied apartment home increased 130 91 to 1558 compared to 1432
    for 2000 the average economic occupancy decreased from 976 in 2000 to
    954 for 2001

although most of our markets have been affected by the current recession we
have observed the most volatility in market rents and occupancy in certain
northern california submarkets over the past two years which accounts for
approximately 372 of current established community rental revenue this
volatility in rents and occupancy was partially related to volatility in the
technology sector that comprises a significant portion of the northern
california economy while market rental rates increased substantially in 2000
we have experienced a 220 decline in market rental rates for that region
during 2001 economic occupancy decreased in the northern california region
from 978 for 2000 to 939 for 2001 we could see further declines in
occupancy and market rents as this market resets to more sustainable levels
also in 2001 we experienced greater volatility in occupancy related to our
corporate and furnished

apartment homes throughout our portfolio partially due to reduced business
travel our exposure to these homes fell from a peak of approximately 70 to
approximately 45 of our current portfolio at year end

operating expenses excluding property taxes increased primarily due to the
addition of newly developed redeveloped and acquired apartment homes in
2001 separation costs of 2493000 due to the departure of a senior
executive during the first quarter contributed to the increase for that year
maintenance insurance and other costs associated with development and
redevelopment communities go from being capitalized when the community is
under construction to expensed when and as homes within the community receive
a certificate of occupancy insurance expense has increased over the past two
years particularly during 2001 as the insurance and reinsurance markets
deteriorated resulting in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate
sector we renewed our general liability policy on august 1 2001 and our
property coverage on november 1 2001 while the terms of our insurance
coverage has not materially changed the level of our deductible and premium
costs increased significantly we expect that our insurance costs will
increase in 2002 by approximately 92 million of which 4 million is for the
primary layer of property coverage including the cost of deductible
allocations which now represents uninsured losses that previously would have
been covered by insurance the remaining 52 million increase is for the
upper layers of property coverage and casualty coverage

    for established communities 2001 operating expenses excluding property
    taxes and unallocated overhead expenses increased 3559000 48 to
    76995000 due to increases in insurance utilities marketing and office
    and administration expenses during 2000 operating expenses increased
    2754000 47 due to higher payroll insurance decorating and
    maintenance costs which were partially offset by lower utility and
    marketing costs

property taxes increased due to higher assessments and the addition of newly
developed redeveloped or acquired apartment homes partially offset by the
sale of communities property taxes on development and redevelopment
communities are capitalized while the community is under construction we
begin to expense these costs as homes within the community receive a
certificate of occupancy

    for established communities the increase in property taxes in 2001 of
    969000 was primarily due to higher assessments throughout all regions
    the increase in 2000 was primarily due to an adjustment made in 1999 to
    eliminate accrued but unassessed taxes and payments made in 2000 to settle
    prior year assessments

interest expense increased in 2001 primarily due to the issuance of
350000000 of unsecured notes during the second half of 2000 and the
issuance of 300000000 of unsecured notes in september 2001 the increase in
interest expense in 2000 compared to 1999 was due to the issuance of unsecured
notes an increase in short term interest rates and a decrease in capitalized
interest we expect to issue 200000000 or more of unsecured debt in 2002
of which 100000000 will be used to refinance maturing unsecured debt

depreciation expense changes are primarily related to the timing of asset
sales acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities
depreciation expense increased 7469000 and 12851000 in 2001 and 2000
respectively we expect that depreciation expense will continue to increase
during 2002 as we anticipate a reduction in asset sales compared to prior
years

general and administrative expense increased in 2001 primarily due to an
increase in office personnel and related payroll costs and compensation
expense of 784000 related to the retirement of a senior executive
contributing to the increase in 2000 there was an increase in compensation
expense for a senior officer whose salary was expensed in 2000 but
capitalized in 1999 while he served the company in a different capacity and
consulting costs related to services provided by a former senior officer

equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures represents our share of net
income or loss from joint ventures the decrease in 2001 related primarily to
our pro rata share of net losses from a technology investment accounted for
under the equity method as well as a valuation allowance of 934000 for an
investment in a technology company accounted for under the cost method

interest income during 2001 increased due to higher average cash balances
invested the decrease in interest income during 2000 related primarily to the
sale of the fairlane woods participating mortgage note in the fourth quarter of
1999

gain on sale of communities of 62852000 40779000 and 47093000 were
realized in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively these gains are the result of
our strategy to sell communities that do not meet our longterm strategic
objectives and redeploy the proceeds to current development and redevelopment
communities the amount of gains realized depend on many factors including the
number of communities sold the size and carrying value of those communities
and the market conditions in the local area in 2002 we expect to decrease our
disposition activity compared to recent years

funds from operations

we consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of our
operating performance because it helps investors understand our ability to incur
and service debt and to make capital expenditures we believe that to understand
our operating results ffo should be examined with net income as presented in
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income included
elsewhere in this report ffo is determined in accordance with a definition
adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate
investment trustsr and is defined as

               net income or loss computed in accordance with generally
                accepted accounting principles gaap except that excluded
                from net income or loss are gains or losses on sales of property
                and extraordinary as defined by gaap gains or losses on debt
                restructuring
               plus depreciation of real estate assets and
               after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
                ventures

ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance
with gaap therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income as
an indication of our performance ffo should also not be considered an
alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap
or as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of
cash available to fund cash needs further ffo as calculated by other reits may
not be comparable to our calculation of ffo the following is a reconciliation
of net income to ffo and a presentation of gaap based cash flow metrics dollars

capitalization of fixed assets and community improvements

our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize only
nonrecurring expenditures we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the
item

               exceeds 15000
               extends the useful life of the asset and
               is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next
                resident

under this policy virtually all capitalized costs are nonrecurring as
recurring makeready costs are expensed as incurred recurring makeready costs
include the following

               carpet and appliance replacements
               floor coverings
               interior painting and
               other redecorating costs

we capitalize purchases of personal property such as computers and furniture
only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds 2500 we generally
expense purchases of personal property made for replacement purposes for
established and other stabilized communities we recorded nonrevenue generating
capitalized expenditures of approximately 251 per apartment home in 2001 and
225 per apartment home in 2000 the average maintenance expense including
carpet and appliance replacements related to these communities was 1196 per
apartment home in 2001 and 1145 in 2000 we anticipate that capitalized costs
per apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities
increases

liquidity and capital resources

liquidity the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations
operating cash flows have historically been determined by

               the number of apartment homes

               rental rates

               occupancy levels and

               our expenses with respect to these apartment homes


the timing source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and
used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment
particularly to changes in interest rates changes in the capital markets
environment affect our plans for undertaking construction and development as
well as acquisition activity

cash and cash equivalents totaled 72986000 on december 31 2001 an increase
of 15752000 for the year the following discussion relates to changes in cash
due to operating investing and financing activities which are presented in our
consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report

operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities increased to
308723000 in 2001 from 296462000 in 2000 primarily due to additional
operating income from newly developed and redeveloped communities as well as
growth in operating income from established communities partially offset by the
loss of operating income from communities sold

page


investing activities  net cash used in investing activities of 259391000 in
2001 related to investments in assets through development and redevelopment of
apartment communities partially offset by proceeds from the sales of apartment
communities

     during 2001 we invested 484604000 in the purchase and development of
     real estate

         we began the development of nine new communities these communities
          are expected to contain a total of 2135 apartment homes upon
          completion and the total investment including land acquisition
          costs is projected to be approximately 362000000 also we
          completed the development of six new communities containing a total of
          1656 apartment homes for a total investment of 274000000


         we acquired six land parcels during 2001 on which construction has not
          yet commenced if developed in the manner expected we expect that the
          six new communities developed on these parcels would contain a total
          of 1615 apartment homes at an investment including land acquisition
          costs of 52110000 of approximately 331000000 in addition we
          continue to hold three parcels of land purchased prior to january 2001
          that if developed in the manner expected would contain three new
          communities with a total of 537 apartment homes total land held for
          future development including carrying cost totals 66608000


         we completed the redevelopment of one community containing 294
          apartment homes during 2001 for a total investment in redevelopment
          ie excluding acquisition costs of 24400000


         we acquired three communities containing 995 apartment homes for
          approximately 129300000 we acquired these communities in
          connection with a fixed price forward purchase agreement signed in
          1997 with an unaffiliated party

     the development and redevelopment of communities involves risks that the
     investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations see risks
     of development and redevelopment in item 2 of this report for our
     discussion of these and other risks inherent in developing or redeveloping
     communities

     we sold seven apartment communities during 2001 as we seek to optimize the
     level of our geographical concentration in selected high barriertoentry
     markets when market conditions are favorable the net proceeds of
     238545000 generated by these sales are being used to develop and
     redevelop communities currently under construction or reconstruction we
     deposited the proceeds from two of these sales into a cash escrow account
     to facilitate a likekind exchange transaction the remaining proceeds were
     invested or used to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate
     unsecured credit facility until needed to fund development or redevelopment
     activities

financing activities  net cash used in financing activities totaled 33580000
for the year ended december 31 2001 primarily due to dividends paid and the
redemption of our series f and series g preferred stock partially offset by the
proceeds from the issuance of 300000000 of unsecured notes in september 2001
see note 3 notes payable unsecured notes and credit facility and note 4
stockholders equity in our consolidated financial statements for additional
information

we regularly review our short and longterm liquidity needs the adequacy of
funds from operations as defined above and other expected liquidity sources to
meet these needs we believe our principal shortterm liquidity needs are to
fund

         normal recurring operating expenses

         debt service payments

         the distributions required with respect to preferred stock




                                       42
page




         the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit
          qualification under the internal revenue code of 1986

         opportunities for the acquisition of improved property and

         development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently
          engaged

we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash
flows provided by operating activities and capacity under the unsecured credit
facility

one of our principal longterm liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and
longterm debt at the time at which such debt matures for unsecured senior
notes we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes
will be repaid prior to maturity if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to
repay our indebtedness it will be necessary for us to refinance this debt this
refinancing may be accomplished by additional debt financing that is
collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities
by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings or by additional equity
offerings we also anticipate having significant retained cash flow in each year
so that when a debt obligation matures some or all of each maturity can be
satisfied from this retained cash although we believe we will have the capacity
to meet our longterm liquidity needs we cannot assure you that additional debt
financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or if available that
they will be on terms we consider satisfactory

capital resources we intend to match the longterm nature of our real estate
assets with longterm cost effective capital to the extent permitted by
prevailing market conditions since january 1 2000 external sources of debt
capital used to fund investment activities totaled 650000000 representing
issuances of ten year unsecured debt during this same two year period cash
flow from operating activities exceeded dividends paid by 216000000 we
expect both sources of capital to remain available to meet our capital needs for
the foreseeable future

variable rate unsecured credit facility

our unsecured revolving credit facility is furnished by a consortium of banks
and provides 500000000 in shortterm credit under the terms of the credit
facility if the company elects to increase the facility up to 650000000 the
consortium of banks cannot prohibit such an increase of the facility and the
increased lending commitment could be provided by one or more banks from the
consortium or otherwise to the extent they choose to commit to lend additional
funds we pay participating banks an annual facility fee of 750000 in equal
quarterly installments the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying
levels tied to the london interbank offered rate libor based on ratings levels
achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us the
current stated pricing is libor plus 060 per annum 25 on march 1 2002 a
competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to 400000000 this
option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us
loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured
credit facility the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if
market conditions allow pricing under the competitive bid option resulted in
average pricing of libor plus 043 for amounts most recently borrowed under the
competitive bid option at march 1 2002 zero was outstanding 85820000 was
used to provide letters of credit and 414180000 was available for borrowing
under the unsecured credit facility

interest rate protection agreements

we are not a party to any longterm interest rate agreements other than
interest rate protection and swap agreements on approximately 167000000 of
our variable rate taxexempt indebtedness we intend however to evaluate the
need for longterm interest rate protection agreements as interest rate market
conditions dictate and we have engaged a consultant to assist in managing our
interest rate risks and exposure

future financing and capital needs

as of december 31 2001 we had 15 new communities under construction also one
additional community is being built by an unaffiliated third party with whom we
have entered into a fixed price forward purchase commitment as of december 31
2001 a total estimated cost of 404682000 remained to be invested in these
communities in addition we had three other communities under reconstruction
for which an estimated 10191000 remained to be invested

substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the
communities currently under construction and reconstruction will be funded from

         the remaining capacity under our current 500000000 unsecured credit
          facility

         the net proceeds from sales of existing communities

         retained operating cash andor

         the issuance of debt or equity securities

we expect to continue to fund development costs related to pursuing development
rights from retained operating cash and borrowings under the unsecured credit
facility we believe these sources of capital will be adequate to take the
proposed communities to the point in the development cycle where construction
can begin before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a
development right begins we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete
these undertakings although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
such financing in the event that financing cannot be obtained we may have to
abandon development rights writeoff associated pursuit costs that were
capitalized andor forego reconstruction activity in such instances we will
not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such
pursuits and the related writeoff of costs will increase current period
expenses

our liquidity could be adversely impacted by expanding development and
acquisition activities andor reduced capital as compared to prior years
available from asset sales to meet the balance of our liquidity needs under
such conditions we would need to arrange additional capacity under our existing
unsecured credit facility sell additional existing communities andor issue
additional debt or equity securities while we believe we have the financial
position to expand our shortterm credit capacity and support our capital
markets activity we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing
these arrangements sales or offerings the failure to complete these
transactions on a costeffective basis could have a material adverse impact on
our operating results and financial condition including the abandonment of
development pursuits and a resulting charge to earnings

it is our policy to sell assets that do not meet our longterm investment
criteria when market conditions are favorable and to redeploy the proceeds
under our disposition program we solicit competing bids from unrelated parties
for these individual assets and consider the sales price and tax ramifications
of each proposal we intend to actively seek buyers for communities that we
determine to hold for sale however we cannot assure you that the assets can be
sold on terms that we consider satisfactory we expect to significantly curtail
our disposition program in 2002 in response to anticipated real estate and
capital markets conditions

we have minority interest investments in five technology companies including
constellation real technologies llc an entity formed by a number of real estate
investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of
investing in multisector real estate technology opportunities our original
commitment to constellation was 4 million constellation has proposed a
reduction in the aggregate amount of capital commitments from its members if
that proposal is accepted our revised commitment would fall to 26 million as
of march 1 2002 we have contributed approximately 959000 in january 2002
we invested an additional 23 million in realeum inc a company involved in
the development and deployment of a property management and leasing automation
system pursuant to an agreement with realeum inc we will utilize the
property management and leasing automation system in exchange for




                                       44
page




payments under a licensing arrangement realeum inc is negotiating licensing
arrangements with other real estate companies unaffiliated with avalonbay as of
march 1 2002 the total remaining carrying value of our investments in the five
technology companies was 48 million we have no obligation to contribute
additional funds other than the commitment to constellation described above

inflation

substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less this may
enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the
beginning of new leases shortterm leases generally minimize our risk from the
adverse effects of inflation although these leases generally permit residents
to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty we believe that
shortterm leases combined with relatively consistent demand results in rents
and cash flow which provide an attractive inflation hedge

critical accounting policies

our accounting policies are in conformity with gaap the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment
in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and
assumptions these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and
circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is
possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in
a different presentation of our financial statements below is a discussion of
accounting policies which we consider critical in that they may require complex
judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are
inherently uncertain additional discussion of accounting policies which we
consider significant including further discussion of the critical accounting
policies described below can be found in the notes to our consolidated
financial statements

real estate development rights

with few exceptions we capitalize predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of
new development opportunities these costs include legal fees design fees and
related overhead costs the accompanying consolidated financial statements
include a charge to expense to provide an allowance for unrecoverable




                                       46
page


capitalized predevelopment costs that may be written off if we determine that a
predevelopment community is unlikely to be developed

real estate

if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in
the value of a community our policy is to assess the impairment by making a
comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community
over its remaining useful life on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount
of the community if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected
operating cash flows of the community we would recognize an impairment loss
equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated
fair market value we have not recognized an impairment loss in 2001 2000 or
1999 on any real estate

investments in technology companies

the company has minority interest investments in five technology companies as
of march 1 2002 the total remaining carrying value of these investments net
of an allowance of 934000 was 4819000 if there is an event or change in
circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment our policy is
to record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value a
loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of
the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that
would justify the carrying amount of the investment due to the nature of these
investments an impairment in value can be difficult to determine

legal contingencies

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the
ordinary course of business these matters are frequently covered by insurance
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we
believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or the results of operations once it has been
determined that a loss is probable to occur the estimated amount of the loss is
recorded in the financial statements both the amount of the loss and the point
at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine




item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to certain financial market risks the most predominant being
fluctuations in interest rates interest rate fluctuations are monitored by us
as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially
adverse effect on our results of operations the effect of interest rate
fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting
operating results such as rental rates and occupancy the specific market risks
and the potential impact on our operating results are described below

our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of
borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as
outstanding bonds with variable interest rates we had 125274000 and
67960000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2001 and 2000
respectively if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis
points higher throughout 2001 and 2000 our annual interest costs would have
increased by approximately 1500000 and 2500000 respectively based on
balances outstanding during the applicable years




                                       47

we currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest
rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness under swap agreements

         we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been
          incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate
          generally the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the
          date the agreement is entered into plus a fixed increment and

         the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been
          incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest
          rate tied to a particular market index

as of december 31 2001 the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest
rate on approximately 167272000 of our variable rate taxexempt debt
furthermore swap agreements fix the interest rate on approximately 23500000
of unconsolidated variable rate debt as of december 31 2001 the swap
agreements were not electively entered into by us but rather were a
requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related
to certain of our taxexempt bond financings because the counterparties
providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a
or better credit rating by the standard  poors ratings group and the interest
rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market
rates for such agreements we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a
default by a counterparty provider

1  organization and significant accounting policies

organization

avalonbay communities inc the company which term unless the context
otherwise requires refers to avalonbay communities inc together with its
subsidiaries is a maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real
estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as
amended the company focuses on the ownership and operation of upscale apartment
communities in high barriertoentry markets of the united states these markets
are located in the northeast midatlantic midwest pacific northwest and
northern and southern california regions of the country

at december 31 2001 the company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership
interest in 126 operating apartment communities containing 37228 apartment
homes in eleven states and the district of columbia of which three communities
containing 1896 apartment homes were under reconstruction in addition the
company owned 15 communities with 3963 apartment homes under construction and
rights to develop an additional 30 communities that if developed as expected
will contain an estimated 8918 apartment homes

principles of consolidation

the company is the surviving corporation from the merger the merger of bay
apartment communities inc bay and avalon properties inc avalon on
june 4 1998 where avalon shareholders received a 07683 share of common stock
of the company for each share owned of avalon common stock the merger was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with the historical
financial statements for avalon presented prior to the merger at that time
avalon ceased to legally exist and bay as the surviving legal entity adopted
the historical financial statements of avalon consequently bays assets were
recorded in the historical financial statements of avalon at an amount equal to
bays debt outstanding at that time plus the value of capital stock retained by
the bay stockholders which approximates fair value in connection with the
merger the company changed its name from bay apartment communities inc to
avalonbay communities inc

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
company and its whollyowned partnerships and certain joint venture partnerships
in addition to subsidiary partnerships structured as downreits all significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation

in each of the partnerships structured as downreits either the company or one
of the companys whollyowned subsidiaries is the general partner and there are
one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by
units of limited partnership interest for each downreit partnership limited
partners are entitled to receive distributions before any distribution is made
to the general partner although the partnership agreements for each of the
downreits are different generally the distributions per unit paid to the
holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated the
companys current common stock dividend per share each downreit partnership has
been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to
a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the
partnership agreement the holders of units of limited partnership interest have
the right to present each unit of limited partnership interest for redemption
for cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the companys common stock
on the date of redemption in lieu of a cash redemption of a limited partners
unit the company may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one
share of common stock

the company has minority interest investments in five technology companies the
company accounts for these unconsolidated entities in accordance with accounting
principles board apb opinion no 18 the equity method of accounting for
investments in common stock in 2001 the company applied the equity method of
accounting to its investment in realeum inc a company involved in the
development and deployment of a property management and leasing automation
system the remaining investments are accounted for under the cost

method of accounting as of december 31 2001 the aggregate carrying value of
our investment in these five companies net of an allowance of 934 was 2519
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the
value of an investment the companys policy is to record the loss and reduce
the value of the investment to its fair value a loss in value would be
indicated if the company could not recover the carrying value of the investment
or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the
carrying amount of the investment

5 derivative instruments and hedging activities

in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 133 as
amended by sfas no 137 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities  deferral of the effective date of sfas no 133 and sfas no 138
accounting for certain instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment
of statement 133 was adopted by the company on january 1 2001 sfas no 133
as amended establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value sfas no 133 also requires that a change
in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met for fair value hedge transactions
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair
value of the hedged item due to the risk being hedged are recorded through the
income statement for cash flow hedge transactions changes in the fair value of
the derivative instrument are reported in other comprehensive income for hedges
where the changes in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in fair
value of the hedged item the ineffective portion is recognized in current
period earnings derivatives which are not part of a hedge relationship are
recorded at fair value through earnings

the company has historically used interest rate swap agreements the swap
agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its variable
rate taxexempt bonds the company has not entered into any interest rate hedge
agreements or treasury locks for its conventional unsecured debt the swap
agreements are not held for trading



                                      f14
page

or other speculative purposes as of december 31 2001 the effect of these swap
agreements is to fix 167272 of the companys taxexempt debt at a weighted
average interest rate of 60 with an average maturity of 45 years by using
derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest
rates the company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk

the credit risk is the risk of a counterparty not performing under the terms of
the swap agreement the counterparties to these swap agreements are major
financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard
 poors ratings group the company monitors the credit ratings of
counterparties and the amount of the companys debt subject to swap agreements
with any one party therefore the company believes the likelihood of realizing
material losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote

market risk is the adverse effect of the value of financial instruments that
results from a change in interest rates the market risk associated with
interestrate contracts is managed by the establishment and monitoring of
parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be
undertaken these risks are managed by the companys chief financial officer and
vice president of finance

the company has determined that its swap agreements qualify as effective
cashflow hedges under sfas no 133 when entering into hedging transactions
the company documents the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged
items as well as the risk management objective and strategy the company
assesses both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of all
hedges in offsetting cash flows of hedged items in accordance with sfas no
133 the company records all changes in the fair value of the swap agreements in
other comprehensive income amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will
be reclassified into earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by
the hedged cash flows for example the reduction in fair value on a cash flow
hedge due to the periodic payment of interest under the swap agreements is
recorded in earnings each period the combination of this expense with the lower
interest expense we expect to pay on the underlying floating rate debt should
result in overall interest expense equal to the contractually fixed amount
resulting from the fixed rate swaps in all situations where hedge accounting is
discontinued the derivative will be carried at fair value with changes in its
fair value recognized in income upon the termination of a hedging relationship
the amount in other comprehensive income will be amortized over the remaining
life of the hedged cash flows

at january 1 2001 in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no
133 the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of 6412 to other
comprehensive loss to recognize at fair value all of the derivatives that are
designated as cash flow hedging instruments through december 31 2001 the
company recorded additional unrealized losses to other comprehensive loss of
2599 to adjust the swap agreements to their fair value in connection with the
sale of a community during the first quarter of 2001 a swap agreement with a
fair value of 528 was transferred to the new owner hedge ineffectiveness did
not have a material impact on earnings and the company does not anticipate that
it will have a material effect in the future the swap agreements are included
in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets

9 segment reporting

the companys reportable operating segments include established communities
other stabilized communities and developmentredevelopment communities
annually on january 1st the company determines which of its communities fall
into each of these categories and maintains that classification throughout the
year for the purpose of reporting segment operations

               established communities also known as same store communities
                are communities where a comparison of operating results from the
                prior year to the current year is meaningful as these
                communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and costs as
                of the beginning of the prior year these communities are
                divided into geographic regions for the year 2001 the
                established communities were communities that had stabilized
                occupancy and costs as of january 1 2000 a community is
                considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of i
                attainment of 95 occupancy or ii the oneyear anniversary of
                completion of development or redevelopment

               other stabilized includes all other completed communities that
                have stabilized occupancy as defined above and communities
                held for sale

               developmentredevelopment consists of communities that are under
                construction and have not received a final certificate of
                occupancy and communities where substantial redevelopment is in
                progress or is planned to take place during the current year

the primary financial measure for established and other stabilized communities
is net operating income noi which represents total revenue less operating
expenses and property taxes the primary performance measure for communities
under development or redevelopment depends on the stage of completion while
under development management monitors actual construction costs against
budgeted costs as well as economic occupancy while under leaseup the primary
performance measures for these assets are leaseup pace compared to budget and
rent levels compared to budget
