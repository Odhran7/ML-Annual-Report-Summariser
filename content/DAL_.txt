general 

as a global airline based in the us we connect customers across our expansive global network in 2019 prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic we served approximately 200 million customers and were the world’s largest airline by total revenues and the most profitable with five consecutive years of 5 billion or more in pretax income from 2015 through 2019 in 2020 we made significant adjustments to our network and operations as a result of the unprecedented and widespread impact of covid19 and the related travel restrictions and social distancing measures that significantly reduced demand for air travel 

we began restoring our network in 2021 as travel restrictions eased and vaccine programs became widespread both domestically and in international markets as the year progressed we saw a full return of domestic consumer travel to 2019 levels while business and international demand continued to lag despite this lag business and international travel began to increase in the latter part of 2021 spurred in part by the us government’s lifting of restrictions in november 2021 that prevented travelers from entering the united states from a number of specificallyidentified countries 

in 2021 we continued to demonstrate agility operational excellence and discipline we believe that we are well positioned to manage the continued challenges brought by the pandemic even when considering new variants spreading globally continued uncertainty linked to the full return of business travel and evolving international travel restrictions more information about the effect of the covid19 pandemic on our business and our recovery can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

competitive advantages and brand strength 

we have five competitive advantages that support our trusted consumer brand including our people and culture our global network our operational reliability our customer loyalty and our financial foundation through the pandemic we believe that we have strengthened our advantages and our brand in 2021 we continued to have the world’s most valuable airline brand 

people and culture 

our people are our strongest competitive advantage our employees provide worldclass travel experiences for our customers while also giving back to the communities where they live work and serve throughout the pandemic we were able to avoid involuntary furloughs of us employees by providing voluntary separation and early retirement programs voluntary unpaid leaves and other initiatives we have prioritized the health and safety of our employees by implementing an extensive employee covid19 testing program partnering with georgia to host the state’s largest covid19 vaccination site while steadily increasing the vaccination rate among our employees providing pay protection programs for employees diagnosed with exposed to or at high risk from covid19 and offering free flu shots for all us employees in february 2021 we hired a chief health officer to reimagine our approach to health and wellbeing to accommodate the physical and mental health needs of our people delta was recognized by glassdoor as one of its best places to work for the sixth year in a row ranking number 18 on the 2022 list of 100 large companies the list is solely based on the input of employees who provide anonymous feedback on their daily jobs benefits interview experience and work environment being recognized on this list is a testament to delta people and our culture 

global network 

we and our alliance partners collectively serve over 130 countries and territories and over 800 destinations around the world in 2019 prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic we offered more than 5000 daily departures and as many as 15000 affiliated departures including the premier skyteam alliance of which delta is a founding member at the end of 2021 we offered more than 4000 daily departures and approximately 5500 affiliated departures as we began restoring our network

our domestic network is centered around core hubs in atlanta minneapolisst paul detroit and salt lake city core hubs have strong local passenger share a high penetration of customers loyal to delta competitive cost position and strong margins core hub positions complement strong coastal hub positions in boston los angeles new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk and seattle coastal hubs provide a strong presence in large revenue markets and enable growth in premium products and international service we are elevating the customer experience in key markets by deploying our newest aircraft and products and by accelerating generational airport investments we opened a new facility at salt lake city in 2021 and expect to open new facilities at new yorklaguardia los angeles and seattle in 2022 in addition to our domestic mainline operations we have agreements with domestic regional carriers that operate as delta connection ® to feed traffic to our domestic hubs 

internationally we have significant hubs and market presence in amsterdam londonheathrow mexico city parischarles de gaulle and seoulincheon as we continue our recovery from the impact of the covid19 pandemic we expect to continue to evaluate and adjust our operations to address evolving conditions although our international operations have been substantially curtailed since march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have continued to serve transatlantic transpacific and latin america markets directly on delta and through joint ventures with global airline partners in 2021 we restored approximately 50 of capacity in international markets but do not expect our international network to be fully restored to 2019 levels until 2023 

through innovative alliances with aeroméxico air franceklm china eastern korean air and virgin atlantic and an alliance pending regulatory approval with latam airlines group sa “latam ” we seek to bring more choice to customers worldwide our strategic relationships with these international airlines are an important part of our business as they improve our access to markets around the world and enable us to provide customers a more seamless global travel experience across our alliance network the most significant of these arrangements are commercial joint ventures that include joint sales and marketing coordination colocation of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements in some cases we have reinforced strategic alliances through equity investments where we have opportunity to create deep relationships and maximize commercial cooperation for additional information about the effect of the covid19 pandemic on our investments in these airlines see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our global network is supported by a fleet of approximately 1200 aircraft as of december 31 2021 that are varied in size and capabilities giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network prior to the pandemic we began refreshing our fleet by acquiring new and more fuel efficient aircraft with increased premium seating to replace older aircraft and had begun to reduce our fleet complexity with fewer fleet types we accelerated this fleet simplification strategy by retiring 227 aircraft in 2020 with plans to retire additional aircraft by 2025 though we remain flexible and may decide to fly certain aircraft beyond their planned retirement date to the extent supported by demand our new aircraft are on average 25 more fuel efficient per seat mile than retiring aircraft 

operational reliability 

we remain committed to industryleading reliability and are consistently among the industry’s best performers in 2021 we had a systemwide completion factor of 994 with 880 of our domestic flights arriving on time as reported to the us department of transportation both of which based on preliminary data are expected to exceed the performance of our usbased peers this reliability was a key component in delta being named the top us airline of 2021 by the wall street journal in its annual airline scorecard rankings which tracks seven important operations and customer metrics among nine us airlines this achievement recognizes the consistent efforts of our people to safely deliver reliable ontime service while providing exceptional service 

following the onset of the covid19 pandemic we intensified our focus on ensuring the health and safety of our customers including the creation of our industryleading cleanliness standards through the global cleanliness organization and the implementation of the delta carestandard℠ to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized experience across our facilities and aircraft

customer loyalty 

over the last decade we significantly improved the quality and reliability of our operations and our customer satisfaction scores increased meaningfully as a result with operational excellence bestinclass service and a commitment to ensuring the health and safety of our customers we have continued to earn our customers’ trust and preference by delivering the “delta difference” in 2021 we were recognized as no 1 in customer satisfaction among airlines in north america by jd power underscoring the professionalism care and humanity that our people delivered during one of the most stressful periods for travel in modern history we were also ranked no 1 on fortune magazines most admired airline list for the tenth time in the past 11 years and named one of fast company’s most innovative travel companies in 2021 in 2021 corporate travel professionals also rated us no 1 in the annual business travel news airline survey for the 11th year in a row citing our responsiveness to customers as well as our flexibilityminded approach throughout the pandemic and beyond we believe our continued investment in customer service and experience operations product airports and technology has shaped customer perception of our brand leading to increases in our domestic net promoter scores and increased customer loyalty compared to prepandemic levels in 2021 customers demonstrated increased loyalty through higher levels of engagement with our skymiles program our cobranded american express card and use of our flydelta app with remuneration from our cobranded american express card nearly achieving 2019 levels for the full year and exceeding 2019 levels during the december 2021 quarter 

our skymiles program is designed to attract lifetime members and grow customer loyalty by offering incentives to increase travel with us our awardwinning program offers a wide variety of benefits including award travel and access to complimentary elite benefits and services when traveling with us and our partners as our brand has strengthened the skymiles program has seen an acceleration in membership growth we believe there is opportunity to continue this trend as we seek to elevate our customer engagement through opportunities to earn and redeem mileage credits “miles” as well as cobrand card offerings coupled with a strong customer experience the skymiles program has a large growing and premium membership base this membership base has historically resulted in higher premium revenues and more resilient cash flows for us skymiles has been widely recognized as a top loyalty program by external reviewers such as us news and world report and the points guy 

the skymiles program provides its members with the ability to earn miles when traveling on delta delta connection and our partner airlines miles may also be earned by using certain services offered by program partners such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies to facilitate transactions with participating companies we sell miles to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines our most significant and valuable contract to sell miles relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express miles may be used toward award redemptions such as flights and upgrades on delta our regional carriers and other participating airlines as well as donations with specific charities and more in 2021 10 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel as program members redeemed miles in the loyalty program for approximately 23 million award tickets 

financial foundation 

in response to the effects of the covid19 pandemic we raised significant amounts of liquidity in 2020 through the issuance of debt securities or through bilateral and syndicated secured andor unsecured credit facilities and through the entry into saleleaseback transactions our capital raising efforts were aided by the strength of our balance sheet prior to the pandemic restoring the strength of our balance sheet and reducing debt is a key financial priority during 2021 we executed on our financial priority of stabilizing the business on the path to restoration and recovery since october 2020 we have made progress in restoring our balance sheet by reducing our debt by approximately 12 billion and voluntarily contributing 15 billion to our pension plans we continue to be disciplined in managing nonfuel costs we are efficiently rebuilding the airline capturing fleet renewal benefits and driving operating leverage that we expect to produce a competitive cost structure we expect that our unit revenue premium to the industry and competitive cost structure will support industryleading margins and strong operating cash flow

expanded products and diversified revenue streams 

in addition to our competitive advantages delta continues to differentiate itself from the industry through expanded products diversified revenue streams and investments in technology 

over the last decade we have fundamentally transformed our business by investing in our people our product and our reliability to alter the commoditylike nature of air travel we have a retailoriented merchandised approach to distribution with welldefined and differentiated products for our customers through improved product segmentation we offer distinct travel experiences with clear value propositions that enable customer choice and include exceptional service onboard our aircraft in 2021 approximately onethird of our passenger revenue was from premium products which include delta one ®  delta premium select first class and delta comfort ®  main cabin products including basic economy represented approximately half of our passenger revenue in 2021 we derive the remainder of our passenger revenue from loyalty travel awards and travelrelated services 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels with 64 of tickets sold through direct channels in 2021 these include digital channels such as deltacom and the fly delta app and our reservations specialists where we deliver more direct personalized interactions with our customers at reduced distribution costs indirect distribution channels include online travel agencies and traditional brick and mortar agencies we make fare and product information widely available across those channels in an effort to ensure customers receive the best information and service options 

we continue to implement merchandising initiatives across our distribution channels to allow customers to better understand our product offerings make it easier to buy the products they desire and increase customer satisfaction this merchandising effort is most effective in deltas digital channels where customers can compare all product options in a single easy to understand display 

in recent years we have diversified revenue streams beyond the basic sale of an airline ticket in an effort to reduce the impact of cyclicality and other reductions in air travel demand on our results our partnership with american express provides us a cobrand revenue stream tied to broader consumer spending our continued focus on premium products and customer segmentation enhanced our revenue growth prior to the pandemic and reduced reliance on the most price sensitive customer segment a differentiator that we believe has benefited us during the pandemic we also maintain complementary portfolio businesses such as our cargo business which has grown significantly during the pandemic and our maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” operation where we believe we remain well positioned for growth through contractual agreements with jet engine manufacturers 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect the world’s major freight gateways we have historically generated cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft in 2020 following the onset of the covid19 pandemic reduced industry cargo capacity drove a significant increase in our cargo yield and we also generated cargo revenue through the operation of cargoonly charter flights ie using aircraft in our fleet not being utilized for passenger travel to fly cargo internationally this trend continued in 2021 and we would expect capacity constraints and elevated market yields to continue through 2022 while the industry rebuilds international networks to prepandemic levels we are a member of skyteam cargo an international airline cargo alliance with ten other airlines that offer a network spanning six continents through which we provide global solutions to our customers by connecting our network with those partners 

other complementary businesses 

we have various other businesses arising from our airline operations including the following

environmental sustainability 

during 2021 we built on our previously announced plan to invest 10 billion through the end of 2030 toward airline carbon neutrality the “10 billion airline carbon neutrality goal” by announcing our intention to set new climate goals that are aligned with the applicable framework of the science based targets initiative “sbti” 

• mediumterm goal reducing emissions intensity by 2035 as compared to 2019 based on jet fuel emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs in accordance with sbti guidance for the aviation industry and in line with the paris agreements goal of limiting global warming to well below two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels 

• longterm goal achieving net zero ghg emissions across the airline operation and its value chain scopes 1 2 and 3 no later than 2050 as outlined by the sbti net zero standard criteria 

we have submitted both goals to sbti for validation but we are unable to predict the outcome of that process and when it will be completed 

the global aviation industry is viewed as a hardtoabate sector meaning it is innately difficult to decarbonize we expect our path toward achievement of these ambitious climate goals to include the following levers with the fleet and fuel levers expected to play the most significant roles 

• fleet  currently fleet renewal provides the largest impact on reducing emissions and emissions intensity in 2020 we retired more than 200 of our less efficient aircraft ahead of schedule improving emissions intensity and fuel efficiency on an available seat mile asm basis in 2020 and 2021 as compared to 2019 we expect our fleet renewal plans to continue to improve fuel efficiency in future periods 

• fuel  sustainable aviation fuel saf is central to reducing the lifecycle emissions from aviation fuel however it is not currently available at the scale or cost necessary to meet the industry’s needs we have established a goal of replacing 10 of our jet fuel consumption with saf by the end of 2030 which we expect to require at least 400 million gallons of saf annually at the end of 2021 delta had agreements in place with multiple suppliers for an aggregate of 81 million gallons of saf annually beginning in 2025 subject to thirdparty investment and timely facility development 

• operational initiatives  delta is launching a crossfunctional senior leadership team through a group known as the carbon council to execute and track operational initiatives to reduce jet fuel consumption and improve our emissions intensity this work supplements industrywide efforts to modernize the air traffic control system which would allow for more fuel efficient and therefore less carbon intensive flying 

• technological innovation  we plan to evaluate emerging technologies such as synthetic hydrocarbon fuels direct air capture and carbon capture and sequestration to support our efforts to achieve our climate goals 

• carbon offsets  in the near term and subject to market dynamics delta plans to continue the purchase and retirement of verified carbon offsets in support of our 10 billion airline carbon neutrality goal 

these ambitious goals will require significant capital investment by delta and third parties government policies and incentives research and development from manufacturers and other stakeholders and transformation of some of the world’s largest industries delta is committed to engaging our stakeholders and building coalitions to help drive down cost and increase production and consumption of alternative fuels and new technologies and we recently hired the airline industrys only csuite level chief sustainability officer to lead the continuing development of our climate strategy and transition plan we have joined aviation industryspecific and broader coalitions in an effort to accelerate our climate goals and to influence climate and sustainability policy development for example within the aviation industry delta serves on the steering committee for clean skies for tomorrow which is focused on bringing saf to scale faster by putting in place key processes and sending strong demand signals to the market 

community engagement 

as we connect people with communities experiences and each other we are committed to doing our part to build a better world giving back to the communities where we live work and serve is part of our culture at delta and we focus our efforts in the community on four pillars of support environment equity education and entire wellbeing

employee matters 

human capital and commitment to diversity equity and inclusion 

we believe that delta people are our strongest competitive advantage and the highquality service that they provide sets us apart from other airlines as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 83000 fulltime employee equivalents of which approximately 81000 were based in the us in 2021 as our business began to recover from the impact of the covid19 pandemic we hired approximately 11000 new fulltime employees across our business including pilots flight attendants and gate and reservation agents 

our principal human capital management objectives are to attract retain and develop people who understand and are committed to delivering the “delta difference” that is core to our brand to support these objectives we have put in place programs that seek to 

• prepare our employees for key roles and future leadership positions through a variety of training and development programs 

• reward our people through highly competitive total compensation and benefit programs designed to share our success promote teamwork and foster our people’s physical emotional social and financial wellbeing 

• enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making our workplace more engaging equitable and inclusive 

• drive employees’ professional and community engagement 

the health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving these objectives we have long led the airline industry in employee safety and seek to achieve worldclass personal safety performance we have prioritized the health and safety of our employees by offering an extensive employee covid19 testing program partnering with georgia to host the state’s largest covid19 vaccination site while steadily increasing the vaccination rate among our employees providing pay protection programs for employees diagnosed with exposed to or at high risk from covid19 and offering free flu shots for all us employees 

our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management at delta as a global airline we are in the business of bringing people together and we believe our business should reflect the diversity of our customer base to achieve this goal we seek diverse talent internally and externally in an effort to achieve broader representation throughout our organization we also promote inclusion through education training and development opportunities as well as by leveraging insights from our ten employee resource groups which we refer to as business resource groups totaling membership of more than 25000 as of december 31 2021 during 2021 we offered enhanced inclusion training to our employees with more than 62000 employees participating we also invested in our leadership’s equity education and understanding with nearly 30 of officers participating in a twoday racial equity workshop in 2021 and the remaining officers slated to participate by the end of 2022 in addition we are reviewing and revising systems practices and policies in support of our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion and with a focus on achieving equitable outcomes two key areas on which we are focused are 1 reinforcement of our diverse talent pipeline by among other things requiring hiring candidate slates and interview panels to reflect diversity and creating new pathways to certain roles by removing college degree requirements and 2 closing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of women black and other ethnic minority groups in those roles including doubling the number of black officers and directorlevel employees by 2025 as compared to 2020 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 9 

item 1 business 

we believe that listening engaging and connecting with employees furthers our human capital management objectives we have historically done so primarily through our opendoor policy digital communication across all levels of the company inperson events with senior management and companywide and divisionspecific surveys to evaluate employee satisfaction since the onset of the pandemic senior management has participated in regular companywide town hall discussions with our employees and our senior executive leadership team has regularly shared memos with all employees regarding our ongoing commitment to our people and our culture we have also continued to conduct periodic employee surveys to seek feedback on engagement levels in general our wellbeing programs diversity equity and inclusion efforts and our culture of safety 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2021 20 of our approximately 83000 fulltime equivalent employees were represented by unions 



we are in mediated discussions with the representative of the delta pilots regarding terms of their amendable collective bargaining agreement under the auspices of the national mediation board nmb 

in addition to the domestic airline employee groups discussed above approximately 180 refinery employees of our wholly owned subsidiary monroe energy llc “monroe” are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2022 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act nlra which generally allows either party to engage in selfhelp upon the expiration of the agreement certain of our employees outside the us are represented by unions work councils or other local representative groups 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of gasoline diesel and other refined petroleum products nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations 

the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs which were materially reduced in 2020 and 2021 in large part due to our reduced operations in response to the covid19 pandemic 



1 includes the operations of our regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements 

2 includes the impact of fuel hedge activity refinery segment results and carbon offset costs

monroe energy 

our monroe subsidiaries operate the trainer refinery and related logistics assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk these companies are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards we own monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our new york operations 

refinery operations  the facility is capable of refining approximately 200000 barrels of crude oil per day monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers during 2021 the refinery progressively increased operations ending the year near prepandemic levels additionally due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel the refinery has shifted production to produce more nonjet fuel products 

strategic agreements monroe has agreements in place to exchange the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations 

environmental sustainability  delta is evaluating operational pathways for integrating monroe into a net zero future monroe’s sustainability ambitions include being one of the most energy efficient refineries in the country with the lowest energy intensity and ghg emissions on an absolute and per barrel basis for example monroe is implementing a plan to replace steam driven turbines that currently power pumps at the facility with more efficient and reliable electric motors which will reduce the amount of steam required from the facility’s natural gasfired boilers monroe is also recovering and utilizing methane a potent ghg instead of flaring it to the atmosphere finally in support of delta’s 10 saf goal monroe is evaluating the possibility of producing saf and other renewable fuels at the trainer refinery although additional analyses must be conducted to determine economic and operational viability of various saf production pathways 

fuel hedging program 

our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s inventory we may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency operational reliability services products customer service and loyalty programs the industry has evolved through mergers and new entry both domestically and internationally and evolution in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the presence of subsidized government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with significant financial resources extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to significant competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultralowcost carriers including spirit airlines frontier airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by delta in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers including from pointtopoint carriers on certain international routes through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships

in particular several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including several of our joint ventures as well as those of our competitors have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory in addition alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have enhanced competition in international markets 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the faa exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit willing and able to perform the proposed service is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo as applicable since the passage of the airline industry deregulation act in 1978 airlines have generally been free to launch or terminate service to us airports without restriction except with respect to certain slotcontrolled and schedulefacilitated airports as well as certain constraints related to service to small communities governed by the essential air services program the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act of 2020 the cares act created certain continuation of service obligations in connection with the receipt of payroll support program funds by passenger airlines specifically the dot has the authority until march 1 2022 to require airlines that received such funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before march 1 2020 the dot has issued several orders mandating such service the most recent of which was finalized on april 29 2021 mandating service levels through september 30 2021 subject to certain definitions and exceptions as described in the order 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers the dot engages in regulation of economic matters such as transactions involving allocation of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at airports where such mechanisms are in place the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over some airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act with oversight by the nmb environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international citypairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries that we serve are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and these foreign markets 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports that we serve are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia and jfk in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at londons heathrow airport tokyos haneda airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

airline labor regulation 

in the us airlines and labor unions are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the nmb an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for representation a certified labor union would then commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day cooling off period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “selfhelp” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board peb to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the status quo for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in selfhelp selfhelp includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline the us congress and the president have the authority to prevent selfhelp by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties

environmental regulation 

environmental compliance obligations  our operations are subject to numerous international federal state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions noise reduction water discharges aircraft drinking water storage and use of petroleum and other regulated substances and the management and disposal of hazardous waste substances and materials 

we are also subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites soil andor ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address these impacts we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

ghg emissions  aviation industry ghg emissions particularly carbon emissions and their impact on climate change have become a focus in the international community and within the us in 2016 the international civil aviation organization icao formally adopted a global marketbased emissions offset program known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia this program establishes a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 any growth above the baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offset credits or a lower carbon fuel the baseline for establishing airlines’ offset obligations under corsia was originally set as an average of 2019 and 2020 emissions however given the covid19 pandemic and resulting unprecedented reduction in international travel icao removed 2020 from the baseline calculation for the first phases of corsia from 2021 to 2027 icao has yet to decide how to apply the baseline beyond 2027 some countries and other stakeholders however have advocated for reestablishing 2020 in the baseline and for using 2020 for the future baseline calculation which if adopted would significantly increase the airline industry’s projected obligations under the program and the cost of compliance 

a pilot phase of the corsia program runs from 2021 to 2023 followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027 countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase and the united states agreed to participate in these voluntary phases participation in the second phase is mandatory for certain countries including the united states the us government has not yet enacted legislation to mandate that us operators participate in corsia nonetheless delta has voluntarily submitted verified emissions reports for our 2019 and 2020 international emissions 

additionally the european union eu requires its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its emissions trading scheme ets under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european economic area eea is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the scope of the ets has been narrowed so that it currently applies only to flights within the eea through 2023 to align with the pilot phase of corsia however its scope may be expanded in the future as a result of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu uk flights are no longer part of the eu ets and will fall under a separate uk ets scheme uk ets is applicable to uk domestic flights and flights from the uk to eea countries 

in 2017 icao also adopted aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from new aircraft the new aircraft certification standards applied to new fleet types in 2020 and will apply to inproduction aircraft starting in 2023 but no later than 2028 these standards will not apply to existing inservice aircraft 

in 2016 the us environmental protection agency “epa” issued a final finding under the clean air act that ghgs threaten the public health and welfare and further determined that certain classes of aircraft engines cause or contribute to ghgs the endangerment finding did not establish standards but triggered an obligation for the epa to regulate ghg emissions from certain aircraft engines in january 2021 the epa finalized ghg emission standards for new aircraft engines designed to implement the icao standards on the same timeframe contemplated by icao like the icao standards the final epa standards would not apply to engines on inservice aircraft the final standards have been challenged by several states and environmental groups on november 15 2021 the epa announced that it plans to defend the current standards while simultaneously calling for ambitious new international co 2 standards at the upcoming round of icao negotiations the outcome of the legal challenge cannot be predicted at this time

item 1 business 

the airline industry may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for ghg emissions in various jurisdictions for example in 2021 the european commission proposed legislation that could expand the reach of the eu ets to include flights into and out of the eea beginning in 2027 under certain circumstances increase the stringency of the program and establish a sustainable aviation fuel blending mandate for aviation fuel suppliers beginning in 2025 among other requirements individual eu member states have been developing their own requirements including for example a saf mandate in france that will be phased in beginning in 2022 in the united states various exploratory discussions continue around approaches to address climate change such as carbon pricing without a clear legislative path forward additional regulation could result in taxation regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations certain airports have also adopted and others could in the future adopt ghg emission or climaterelated goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such developments 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditures in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas and other air emissions 

under the energy policy act of 2005 as expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 the renewable fuel standard rfs was created setting up specific targets of renewable fuel to be used in the us economy by mandating the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced by or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases primarily in response to speculation about what the epa andor the us congress will do with respect to compliance obligations in december 2021 the epa issued proposed rfs volume requirements for 2020 2021 and 2022 which are expected to be finalized in the first half of 2022 the epa has not finalized the compliance deadlines to retire our obligations for 2020 and 2021 but we expect those deadlines to be within one year of the effective date of the new rfs volume requirements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the craf program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2022 the craf program has only been activated three times since it was created in 1951 most recently in 2021 to support the military’s effort to evacuate people from afghanistan following the withdrawal of us troops from the country delta played a central role in transporting 10000 afghan refugees that were evacuated from afghanistan and delivering needed supplies

item 1a risk factors 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following material risk factors applicable to delta as described below these risks could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future 

risk factors relating to delta 

the rapid spread of the covid19 virus the continuing spread of its variants the persistence of the resulting pandemic and measures implemented to combat it have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business it is possible that there will be future negative effects that we cannot presently predict including nearterm effects 

the rapid spread of the covid19 virus in 2020 and variants of the virus in 2021 the persistence of the resulting pandemic the measures governments and private parties have implemented in order to stem the spread of this pandemic and the general concern about the virus among travelers have had and are continuing to have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel compared to historical levels and consequently upon our business among other effects of the covid19 pandemic affecting air travel and our business 

• in the united states which is our primary market the federal government discouraged travel and encouraged social distancing efforts and limits on gathering size for an extended period in addition state and local governments issued travel restrictions quarantines and healthrelated curfews or “shelter in place” orders which dissuaded or restricted air travel 

• numerous travel advisories and restrictions were implemented some of which remain in place or have been reinstated between the united states and specific countries and many foreign governments have placed restrictions or quarantines on citizens of other countries including citizens of the us flying into their countries for instance the us and numerous other countries have required and in some instances continue to require airline passengers to provide negative covid19 test results prior to travel into their countries 

• employers in both the public and private sectors have issued instructions to employees to work from home andor have otherwise dissuaded or restricted air travel 

• business conventions and conferences concerts and similar entertainment have been and occasionally continue to be cancelled many popular tourist destinations were closed or operations curtailed significant sporting events were and occasionally continue to be cancelled or held with limited or no spectators 

• travelers have been discouraged from air travel to destinations where covid19 is particularly virulent 

• travelers may be dissuaded from flying due to possible enhanced covid19related screening measures which have been implemented to varying degrees and in different ways across multiple markets we serve or due to the concern that additional travel restrictions implemented between their departure and return may affect their ability to return to their homes 

these effects related to the covid19 pandemic have negatively impacted air travel in general which in turn has materially adversely affected our revenues results of operations and financial condition although vaccines have generally proved to be effective and certain of the restrictions above have been eased in some places the ongoing pandemic including large outbreaks resurgences of covid19 in various regions and appearances of new variants of the virus has resulted and may continue to result in their reinstitution the effectiveness of vaccines against future variants that may develop is also unknown moreover additional currently unknown restrictions or other events dissuading air travel may occur in the future as a result of an increase in covid19 case levels or other factors related to the pandemic including possibly in the near term lengthening the negative effects of the pandemic on our business 

our operations have been and could in the future be negatively affected further if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to covid19 or if they are subject to additional governmental covid19 curfews or “shelter in place” health orders or similar restrictions measures restricting the ability of our airport or inflight employees to come to work negatively impact our service or operations all of which could negatively affect our business 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 17 

item 1a risk factors 

in response to the crisis we took steps to mitigate the effects on our business which themselves may have negative consequences with respect to our business and operations for example we took costsaving actions to significantly reduce our capacity in 2020 but were not able to eliminate all costs related to unused capacity ultimately costsaving measures that we implemented to date or may consider in the future have not made up and will not in the future make up for the loss in revenue as a result of decreased ticket sales and cancellations in addition to protect the safety of our employees and customers we have implemented significant additional cleaning measures on all of our aircraft and at the airports in which we operate which have increased our costs 

we are unable to predict how long conditions related to the pandemic will persist the overall situation remains fluid and it is impossible to predict the timing of future material developments and whether they will occur in the near medium or long term at this time we are also not able to predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may result in permanent changes to our customers’ behavior with such changes including but not limited to a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of increased usage of virtual meetings and videoconferencing and teleconferencing products and more broadly a general reluctance to travel each of which could have a material impact on our business 

collectively the foregoing circumstances have had and are continuing to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition future disease outbreaks or similar public health threats could have similar effects 

we have a significant amount of fixed obligations and incurred significant amounts of new debt in a short period in response to the covid19 pandemic insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business 

we have a significant amount of existing fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition we have substantial commitments for capital expenditures 

we had approximately 142 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities liquidity as of december 31 2021 however our future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this form 10k and in other filings we may make from time to time with the sec if our liquidity is materially diminished we might not be able to timely pay our leases and debts or comply with certain financial covenants in our financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of our contractual obligations 

agreements governing our debt including our credit facilities and our skymiles financing agreements include financial and other covenants certain of these covenants impose restrictions on our business and failure to comply with any of the covenants in these agreements could result in events of default 

our debt agreements contain various affirmative negative and financial covenants including our credit facilities and our skymiles financing agreements each of which contains a minimum liquidity covenant certain of our debt agreements also contain collateral coverage ratios and our skymiles financing agreements contain a debt service coverage ratio a decline in these coverage ratios including due to factors that are beyond our control could require us to post additional collateral or trigger an early amortization event our skymiles financing agreements also restrict our ability to among other things change the policies and procedures of the skymiles program in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially impair repayment of our skymiles debt 

complying with certain of the covenants in our debt agreements and other restrictive covenants that may be contained in any future debt agreements could limit our ability to operate our business and to take advantage of business opportunities that are in our longterm interest the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants 

while the covenants in our debt agreements are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with them and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment refinance the indebtedness subject to these covenants or take other mitigating actions an event of default would result these arrangements also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders or noteholders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and where applicable and subject to the terms of relevant collateral agreements repossess collateral including aircraft or other valuable assets in addition an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one agreement could result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements the acceleration of significant indebtedness could require us to seek to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under our financing arrangements and there is no assurance that such renegotiation or refinancing efforts would be successful

item 1a risk factors 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners 

an aircraft crash or other serious accident involving our aircraft or those of our airline partners could expose delta to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient 

in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety and reliability for aviation authorities and the public which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

breaches or lapses in the security of the technology systems we use and rely on and the data stored within them as well as everevolving global privacy and security regulatory obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

as a regular part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including information necessary for our operations personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

our information systems and those of our service providers are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks and the increase in workfromhome arrangements since the onset of the covid19 pandemic could potentially enhance these risks we expect unauthorized parties to continue attempting to gain access to our systems or information or those of our business partners and service providers including through fraud or other means of deception or introduction of malicious code such as viruses worms trojan horses and ransomware if successful these actions could cause harm to our computer systems or compromise data stored on our computer networks or those of our business partners and service providers for example we were notified in 2018 that a thirdparty vendor of chat services for delta and other companies determined we had been involved in a cyber incident for a short period in 2017 we have incurred remedial legal and other costs in connection with this incident but the costs were not material to our financial position or results of operations hardware or software we or our business partners or service providers develop acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time as a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data in addition to continuously assessing risk and reviewing our procedures processes and technologies we continue to educate our people about these risks and to monitor review and update the process and control requirements we expect third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of information regarding our customers employees or business partners that is in their care however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all information security breaches or misuse of data 

the compromise of our or our business partners’ or service providers’ technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to our information or that of our customers employees or business partners could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business the costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material in addition as cybercriminals become more sophisticated the cost of proactive defensive measures continues to increase

item 1a risk factors 

disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our information technology capability could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend such as power telecommunications or the internet the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers and other security issues a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our information technology infrastructure including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our operations and our customer service result in increased costs and damage our reputation while we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans we have previously experienced infrastructure disruptions and these measures may not be adequate to prevent a future business disruption and any material adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business as recent outages of large cloud providers whom we rely on has shown 

failure of the technology we use to perform effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on technology initiatives and capabilities to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example substantially all of our tickets are issued to our customers as electronic tickets and a growing number of our customers check in using our website airport kiosks and our flydelta mobile application we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as deltacom the flydelta mobile application inflight wireless internet checkin kiosks customer service applications application of biometric technology airport information displays and related initiatives including security for these initiatives we are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems and transitioning to cloudbased technologies the performance reliability and security of the technology we use are critical to our ability to serve customers if this technology does not perform effectively including as a result of the implementation or integration of new or upgraded technologies or systems our business and operations would be negatively affected which could be material 

our commercial relationships with airlines in other parts of the world and the investments that we have in certain of those carriers may not produce the results or returns we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to develop and expand strategic relationships with a number of airlines through joint ventures and other forms of cooperation and support including equity investments we expect to continue exploring ways to deepen our alliance relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these relationships and investments involve significant challenges and risks including that they may not generate the expected financial results or that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the operations of our airline partners and could adversely affect the expansion of strategic relationships in the future these carriers have incurred significant financial losses as a result of the pandemic and some have been or may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws for example following the onset of the pandemic latam and grupo aeroméxico filed voluntary proceedings to reorganize under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code and virgin atlantic undertook a voluntary recapitalization process in the united kingdom uk and instituted ancillary proceedings in support of that process in the us as discussed further in note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic along with these actions the carrying value of our equity investments in these three carriers has been reduced to and remained zero as of december 31 2021 during the december 2021 quarter we announced additional investments in each of these carriers which with respect to latam and grupo aeroméxico remain subject to completion of their respective reorganizations and related terms conditions and approvals if any airline partners that seek to restructure or recapitalize are unable to do so successfully or if our commercial arrangements with these partners are not maintained any investments or other assets associated with those partners could become impaired and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

a significant disruption in or other problems with respect to the operations or performance of third parties on which we rely including thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely on the operations and performance of third parties in a number of areas that are important to our business including thirdparty regional carriers international alliance partners and ground operation providers at some airports while we have agreements with certain of these third parties that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations to the extent that the operations of a third party on which we rely is significantly disrupted including as a result of the pandemic or if these third parties experience significant performance issues including failing to satisfy any applicable performance standards or fail to meet any applicable compliance requirements our revenue may be reduced our expenses may be increased and our reputation may be harmed any or all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

some regional carriers including our whollyowned subsidiary endeavor have faced a shortage of qualified pilots if this shortage becomes more widespread thirdparty regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us and endeavor may not be able to perform as expected which could reduce our capacity available seat miles and revenue resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or our longlived assets causing us to record impairments that may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards we are required to test our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment in addition we are required to test certain of our other assets for impairment where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired during the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 we recorded significant impairment and related charges related to acceleration of our fleet simplification strategy and the writedown of investments in certain airline partners stemming from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

we may be required to recognize losses in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets government regulatory changes decline in the fair values of certain tangible or intangible assets such as aircraft route authorities and airport slots unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties further impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2021 20 of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted the collective bargaining agreement with our pilots became amendable on december 31 2019 and we are in discussions with the representative of the pilots regarding terms of the agreement under the auspices of the nmb separately the nlra governs monroe’s relations with the union representing their employees which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a material adverse effect on our operations

item 1a risk factors 

our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters or other environmental events can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons floods or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate and rising global temperatures could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in our international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality results of operations for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a future period and results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for an entire year 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel over the last decade fuel prices have been highly volatile and at times have increased substantially from 2019 to 2021 our average annual fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges has varied from 164 to 202 with year to year variations ranging from a decrease of 19 to an increase of 23 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from monroe and through strategic agreements associated with the refinery that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we have historically purchased a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

the competitive nature of the airline industry may affect our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers in addition because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase at times in the past we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or disputes involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or taxes changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have a negative impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

if monroes cost of producing nonjet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected

item 1a risk factors 

an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results if insurance is unable to cover a significant liability in addition such an incident could damage our reputation 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position in addition because of our ownership of monroe the occurrence of an environmental or other incident could result in damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation applicable to monroe could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroe’s operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions which are subject to change over time monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results in addition the enactment of new more stringent environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

in particular under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandates the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases primarily in response to speculation about what the epa andor the us congress will do with respect to compliance obligations we cannot predict these actions or the future prices of rins during 2021 and 2020 monroes operating losses were driven in part by an increase in rins costs monroe’s purchase of rins at elevated prices in the future could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroe’s products could limit the refinery’s production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and we are not able to replace these persons with individuals with comparable skills or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified senior management and other key personnel as needed in the future

item 1a risk factors 

significant damage to our reputation and brand including as a result of significant adverse publicity or inability to achieve certain sustainability goals could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

maintaining our reputation and global brand is critical to our business we operate in a highly visible and public environment with significant realtime exposure to traditional and social media adverse publicity whether justified or not can rapidly spread including through social or digital media in particular passengers can use social media to portray interactions with delta without context in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent we are unable to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to adverse publicity our brand and reputation may be damaged 

our reputation and brand could also be adversely impacted by among other things failure to make progress toward and achieve our environmental sustainability and diversity equity and inclusion goals as well as public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies or negative public perception of the environmental impact of air travel for example we intend to invest 10 billion through 2030 toward airline carbon neutrality and to establish ambitious new medium and longterm goals to reduce our emissions but we are unable to achieve the latter goals using our existing fleet current technologies and available fuel sources we are diligently working to establish a reasonable transition plan with respect to our medium and longterm climate goals however our ability to execute on such a plan is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties as it is dependent on the actions of governments and third parties and will require among other things significant capital investment including from third parties research and development from manufacturers and other stakeholders along with government policies and incentives to reduce the cost and incent production of saf and other technologies that are not presently in existence or available at scale significant damage to our reputation and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results including as a result of litigation related to any of these matters

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or the fear or threat of any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business despite significant security measures at airports and airlines the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups we rely on government provided threat intelligence and utilize private sources to constantly monitor for threats from terrorist groups and individuals including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry in addition the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant security events primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or the fear or threat of any of these events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could have a significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds in addition potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring or could occur such as flight redirections or cancellations reputational harm and other costs if any or all of these types of events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency operational reliability services products customer service and loyalty programs consolidation in the airline industry changes in international alliances the creation of immunized joint ventures and the rise of subsidized governmentsponsored international carriers have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

our domestic operations are subject to significant competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultralowcost carriers including spirit airlines frontier airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by delta in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers including from pointtopoint carriers on certain international routes through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships 

in particular several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including several of our joint ventures as well as those of our competitors have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory in addition alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have enhanced competition in international markets 

the airline industry also faces competition from surface transportation and technological alternatives such as virtual meetings teleconferencing or videoconferencing and the intensity of this competition has likely increased at least in the near term as a result of the covid19 pandemic increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

item 1a risk factors 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate or significant problems associated with a type of aircraft or engine we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations whether resulting from a discrete event such as a hurricane or the manifestation of a chronic physical risk such as rising sea levels could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

similarly the airline industry is heavily dependent on a limited number of aircraft and engine manufacturers whose products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements any significant problems associated with an aircraft or engine type that we operate such as design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public leading to customer avoidance or adverse actions by the faa resulting in grounding could have a negative impact on our operations if we are not able to substitute or replace the affected aircraft or engine type and could in any event have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which is costly and could materially adversely affect our business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs and may have material adverse effects on our business for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures and could carry operational implications we expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations in addition a directive or other regulation that has a significant operational impact on us could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations reduce revenues or otherwise impact our business the industry is heavily taxed additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

airport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations or otherwise adversely affect an airline’s business certain of our hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been and could in the future be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day air traffic control inefficiencies can also enhance these pressures 

in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system which is regulated by the faa has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as an international carrier we are subject to a wide variety of us and foreign laws that affect trade including tariff and trade policies export and import requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges in particular the imposition of significant tariffs with respect to aircraft that we are not able to mitigate could substantially increase our costs which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition some of our operations are in highrisk legal compliance environments failure to comply with trade sanctions and restrictions the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions as well as other applicable laws or regulations could result in litigation assessment of damages imposition of penalties or other consequences any or all of which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial results in certain circumstances we also may be subject to consequences of the failure of our airline partners to comply with laws and regulations including us laws to which they may be subject such as the fcpa 

we and other us carriers are subject to us and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate and which are continuously evolving requiring ongoing monitoring and updates to our privacy and information security programs although we dedicate significant resources to manage compliance with global privacy and information security obligations this challenging regulatory environment may pose material risks to our business including increased operational burdens and costs regulatory enforcement and legal claims or proceedings

item 1a risk factors 

the airline industry is subject to many forms of environmental regulation including but not limited to increased regulation to reduce emissions and other risks associated with climate change the cost of compliance with more stringent environmental regulations failure to comply with existing or future regulations or failure to otherwise manage the risks of climate change effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business 

many aspects of our operations are subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws governing the protection of the environment compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations could require capital investment and increase operational costs and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry in order to address aircraft carbon dioxide emissions the international civil aviation organization a united nations specialized agency formally adopted a global marketbased emission offset program known as corsia this program establishes a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 through the use of carbon offsets andor lower carbon aviation fuel the baseline for establishing airlines’ offset obligations under corsia was originally set as an average of 2019 and 2020 emissions however given the covid19 pandemic and resulting unprecedented reduction in international travel icao removed 2020 from the baseline calculation for the first phases of corsia from 2021 to 2027 icao has yet to decide how to apply the baseline beyond 2027 some countries and other stakeholders however have advocated for reestablishing 2020 in the baseline and for using 2020 for the future baseline calculation which if adopted would significantly increase the airline industry’s projected obligations under the program and the cost of compliance certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be predicted at this time however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally 

in addition to corsia we may face a patchwork of regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and could become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions for example in 2021 the european commission proposed legislation that would expand the reach of the eu ets to include flights into and out of the european economic area beginning in 2027 under certain circumstances increase the stringency of the program and establish a sustainable aviation fuel blending mandate for aviation fuel suppliers among other requirements individual eu member states have been developing their own requirements including for example a saf mandate in france that will be phased in at the beginning of 2022 in the united states various exploratory discussions continue around approaches to address climate change such as carbon pricing without a clear legislative path forward additional regulation could result in taxation regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for the airline industry including delta in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations while the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the us or other countries could impose significant additional costs on or otherwise adversely affect our operations certain airports have also adopted and others could in the future adopt greenhouse gas emission or climaterelated goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure 

in addition to risks from potential changes to environmental regulation and policy the transition to lowercarbon technologies such as saf or changes in consumer preferences resulting from a negative perception of the environmental impact of air travel could materially adversely affect our business and financial results for example lowercarbon technologies such as saf and direct air capture technologies are currently not available at scale and may take decades to develop and the cost to transition to them could be prohibitively expensive without appropriate government policies and incentives in place as more businesses have publicly announced environmental sustainability goals the cost of carbon offsets has also increased significantly and will likely continue to do so

item 1a risk factors 

because of the global nature of our business unfavorable economic or political conditions in the markets in which we operate or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally our business is subject to economic and political conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the economy in the us or abroad including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the worldwide response to it demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

our international operations are an important part of our route network political disruptions and instability around the world can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel additionally any deterioration in global trade relations such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel

financial highlights  2021 compared to 2019 

our pretax income for 2021 was 398 million which includes recognition of 45 billion in grants from the payroll support program extension psp2 and payroll support program 3 psp3 this is a 58 billion decrease compared to 2019 primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business which resulted in a 36 decrease in revenue partially offset by a reduction in operating expense including the government grant recognition pretax loss adjusted a nongaap financial measure which excludes the government grant recognition and other items was 34 billion a decrease of 96 billion compared to 2019 

revenue compared to 2019 our operating revenue decreased 171 billion or 36 due to reduced demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

the length and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to the covid19 pandemic remains uncertain however with continued distribution of effective vaccines and easing of travel advisories and restrictions we believe customer confidence will continue to grow leading to increased demand during 2022 we expect domestic leisure travel to exceed 2019 levels in 2022 while we expect business travel to continue to return as many companies are expected to expand return to office plans throughout 2022 international demand recovery has been uneven as the covid19 variants and related travel restrictions impact various countries within our international network though we believe demand will begin accelerating in the second half of 2022 as travel restrictions are lifted we continue to monitor risks to the pace of recovery from covid19 variants the effectiveness of vaccine programs and travel advisories and restrictions we are planning for our system capacity to be approximately 15 lower in the march 2022 quarter than the march 2019 quarter and approximately 10 lower for the full year of 2022 compared to 2019 

operating expense total operating expense decreased 124 billion or 31 compared to 2019 primarily resulting from recognition of the grants from psp2 and psp3 lower volumerelated expenses mainly fuel and passenger commissions and other selling expenses lower salaries and related costs and profit sharing expense and significant cost reduction measures taken across all aspects of our operation in response to the covid19 pandemic these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses related to refinery sales to third parties reflected in ancillary business and refinery expense as well as recovery related and transition costs incurred eg aircraft reactivation hiring training overtime and reservations volume as we return closer to prepandemic levels of demand and capacity total operating expense adjusted a nongaap financial measure decreased 109 billion or 27 compared to 2019 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 34 

item 7 mda  financial highlights 

our total operating cost per available seat mile casm decreased 2 to 1440 cents compared to 2019 primarily due to the cost reductions discussed above and partially offset by a 29 decrease in capacity nonfuel unit costs casmex a nongaap financial measure increased 11 to 1212 cents due to the 29 decrease in capacity despite a decline in adjusted operating expenses 

minimizing unit cost increases is important to delivering on our overall financial objectives during 2022 however we expect nonfuel unit costs to increase 710 compared to 2019 this expected unit cost increase is primarily due to 2022 capacity projected to be lower than 2019 costs associated with rebuilding our network investments to support an elevated customer experience and our premium brand focus and inflation and labor cost escalation in the underlying business we expect nonfuel unit cost increases compared to 2019 to moderate in future years as we return to and exceed prepandemic capacity and benefit from cost reduction measures implemented during 2020 that were structural in nature 

we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing increased cost inflation as a result of global macroeconomic trends actions we took in response to the covid19 pandemic and labor shortages at our suppliers actions we have taken to mitigate the impact of expected inflation include leveraging scale and efficiency in our underlying business through improved asset utilization and seeking productivity improvements through increased scale efficiencies and technology enhancements 

nonoperating results total nonoperating expense was 15 billion in 2021 11 billion higher than 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of our increased debt balances due to the financing arrangements entered into during 2020 

cash flow our liquidity at december 31 2021 was 142 billion an 82 billion increase compared to december 31 2019 as a result of proceeds from loans and debt issuances and other liquidity initiatives during 2021 operating activities provided 33 billion including 45 billion from the payroll support program grants which was partially offset by the 15 billion in contributions we made to our defined benefit pension plans during 2021 we incurred approximately 900 million of net investing cash outflows primarily for 32 billion capital expenditures partially offset by 24 billion of net redemptions of shortterm investments capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of aircraft fleet modifications our airport redevelopment projects and technology enhancements these results generated 13 billion of free cash flow a nongaap financial measure in 2021 compared to 42 billion in 2019 also during 2021 we had cash outflows of approximately 58 billion related to repayments of our debt and finance leases including approximately 38 billion for early repayments and the remainder from scheduled maturities 

the nongaap financial measures pretax loss adjusted operating expense adjusted casmex and free cash flow used above are defined and reconciled in supplemental information below 

financial highlights  2021 compared to 2020 

our 2021 pretax income improved 160 billion compared to 2020 this was primarily due to the restructuring charges investment impairments and equity method losses recorded during 2020 and a partial recovery in the demand for air travel during 2021 which resulted in a 75 increase in revenue pretax loss adjusted a nongaap financial measure was 34 billion an increase of 56 billion compared to 2020 

revenue compared to 2020 our 2021 operating revenue increased 128 billion or 75 primarily due to increased travel demand 

operating expense total operating expense decreased 16 billion or 5 compared to 2020 primarily resulting from the reduction in restructuring charges and recognition of the psp2 and psp3 grants these decreases were almost fully offset by higher volumerelated expenses associated with the increase in capacity and demand mainly fuel and aircraft maintenance and higher salaries and related costs and an increase in expenses related to refinery sales to third parties reflected in ancillary business and refinery expense total operating expense adjusted a nongaap financial measure increased 51 billion or 21 compared to 2020 

our casm decreased 35 to 1440 cents compared to 2020 primarily due to a 45 increase in capacity and reduction in operating expense from the reduction in restructuring charges and recognition of the psp2 and psp3 grants as noted above casmex a nongaap financial measure decreased 22 to 1212 cents 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 35 

item 7 mda  financial highlights 

nonoperating results total nonoperating expense was 15 billion in 2021 16 billion lower than 2020 primarily due to impairments and our proportionate share of equity method losses related to our investments in latam and grupo aeroméxico in 2020 which were zero in 2021 and marktomarket gains on certain of our other equity investments these decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of our increased debt balances due to the financing arrangements entered into during 2020 and losses on debt extinguishment 

cash flow the 13 billion of free cash flow generated in 2021 compared to 43 billion of negative free cash flow in 2020 

environmental sustainability 

during 2021 we built on our previously announced plan to invest 10 billion through the end of 2030 toward airline carbon neutrality by committing to among other things set medium and longterm climate goals that are aligned with applicable sbti frameworks as described further in part i item 1 business  environmental sustainability we expect our path toward achievement of these ambitious climate goals to depend heavily on increased use of saf which is not presently available at scale or at prices competitive to jet fuel and improved fuel efficiency from fleet renewal and operational initiatives during 2021 we signed agreements with numerous corporate and agency customers to offset the premium from our saf purchases while we do not expect a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in the near term from the use of saf we are unable to predict the financial impact of increased use of saf on our consolidated financial statements over the longer term as government policies and incentives for and sufficient thirdparty investment in saf are necessary to make its use in larger quantities commercially and economically feasible in addition our fleet renewal efforts will require extensive capital investment in future periods 

in the nearterm and subject to market dynamics we also expect to continue the purchase and retirement of verified carbon offsets in support of our 10 billion airline carbon neutrality goal during 2021 we incurred 95 million of expense related to carbon offsets this amount consists of 30 million to address 13 million metric tons of carbon emissions generated by our airline segment from march 1 to december 31 2020 through carbon offsets as well as an additional 65 million for the purchase and retirement of carbon offsets related to a portion of our airline segments 2021 carbon emissions the cost of carbon offsets increased significantly during 2021 and will likely continue to do so which could adversely affect our financial results as we purchase such offsets either in support of our 10 billion airline carbon neutrality goal or in satisfaction of future obligations under corsia which are described further in part i item 1 business  environmental regulation

operating revenue 

our operating revenue increased 128 billion or 75 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 due primarily to increased demand in 2021 as a result of the continued recovery from the covid19 pandemic the increase in operating revenue on a 45 increase in capacity generated a 21 increase in total revenue per available seat mile trasm and a 16 increase in trasm adjusted a nongaap financial measure compared to 2020 

see refinery segment below for additional details on the refinerys operations including thirdparty refinery sales recorded in other revenue during each period 

we have historically generated cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft in 2020 following the onset of the covid19 pandemic reduced industry cargo capacity drove a significant increase in our cargo yield and we also generated cargo revenue through the operation of cargoonly charter flights ie using aircraft in our fleet not being utilized for passenger travel to fly cargo internationally this trend continued in 2021 and we would expect capacity constraints and elevated market yields to continue through 2022 while the industry rebuilds international networks to prepandemic levels compared to 2020 we flew additional cargo volume as international networks returned coupled with a continued increase in yield driven by a combination of constrained capacity and increased demand 

passenger revenue by geographic region

item 7 mda  results of operations 

domestic 

domestic passenger unit revenue prasm for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 27 with capacity up 45 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the low levels of capacity and demand during 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic and the ongoing recovery throughout 2021 

beginning in the latter half of the march 2021 quarter we began to see bookings primarily leisure improve from the low levels of 2020 throughout 2021 demand continued to improve with some variability in periods of rising covid19 cases attributable to variants of the virus we remain optimistic about the ultimate recovery of business travel which has been recovering at a slower pace than consumer we expect this demand to continue to be led by small and mediumsized businesses and accelerate in the first half of 2022 as more corporate offices reopen we are however unable to fully predict the pace of that recovery 

international 

international passenger revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 43 with capacity up 45 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 as travel to certain destinations has resumed or increased additionally while some countries have removed or eased travel restrictions many countries maintained or reinstituted international testing requirements and travel restrictions which have restrained demand in the short term but are expected to support the longterm recovery of international air travel 

in november 2021 travel restrictions on most fully vaccinated foreign visitors to the united states were lifted this action made travel to the us by many foreign nationals possible for the first time in 18 months despite this policy change we expect the significantly lower international demand environment to continue through at least the beginning of 2022 with the recovery pace continuing to trail domestic travel 

the atlantic and pacific regions continue to be the most impacted by the restrictions described above however during 2021 we began resumed or increased our service to certain countries in the atlantic region based on their lifting or easing of travel restrictions travel in the pacific region is largely limited to essential travel and we expect only small demand improvements until government restrictions ease with minimal improvement until at least the second half of 2022 we will continue to be agile in the restoration of our international network based on changes in government restrictions and consumer demand 

the latin america region has shown the most recovery of the international regions with continued demand improvement for leisure destinations in the caribbean mexico and central america we expect this trend to continue through 2022 with the recovery in the atlantic and pacific regions lagging behind latin america 

ticket validity flexibility 

in order to provide our customers more flexibility and time to plan or rebook their travel we made the following changes to our ticket and travel credit expiration dates 

in the march 2021 quarter we announced the extension of the validity of all passenger tickets and travel credits purchased or expiring in 2021 to december 31 2022 which allowed for tickets to be rebooked through december 31 2022 for travel through 2023 

in january 2022 we announced that all existing travel credit holders will have until december 31 2023 to rebook their ticket for travel throughout 2024 additionally all delta customers with upcoming 2022 travel or who purchase a ticket in 2022 will also have the flexibility to rebook their ticket through december 31 2023 and travel throughout 2024 

during 2020 with the exception of basic economy we eliminated change fees for all tickets originating in north america and waived change fees for tickets originating outside of north america we also implemented a temporary waiver that allowed basic economy tickets with travel for 2021 which are normally nonchangeable to be changed without paying a fee regardless of origin or destination starting january 1 2022 basic economy tickets may be cancelled for a fee to receive a partial ticket credit we do not expect the updated change fee policies to materially affect our revenue in future periods however our estimates of revenue that will be recognized for tickets that expire unused ticket breakage may vary in future periods due to the extension of the validity of passenger tickets and travel credits

other revenue 

refinery this represents refinery sales to third parties these sales which are at or near cost increased 21 billion compared to 2020 the increase in thirdparty refinery sales resulted from the refinerys shift to producing and selling more nonjet fuel products due to the lower level of demand for jet fuel compared to historical levels in addition to higher pricing during 2021 see refinery segment below for additional details on the refinerys operations including thirdparty refinery sales recorded in other revenue during each period 

loyalty program loyalty program revenues relate to brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in miles sold including redemption of miles for nontravel awards these revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on american express cards and new cardholder acquisitions as cobrand card spend and card acquisitions continue to be strong revenues from our relationship with american express increased in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 

ancillary businesses ancillary businesses includes aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations 

miscellaneous miscellaneous revenue is primarily composed of lounge access including access provided to certain american express cardholders and codeshare revenues compared to 2020 these transactions have increased due to the ongoing recovery of our business that continued to materialize in 2021 our network of delta sky club lounges was fully reopened by the end of july 2021 after some lounges temporarily closed at the onset of the pandemic in 2020

operating expense 

in response to the reduced demand and related reduction in revenue following the onset of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 we quickly reduced capacity to more closely align with demand implemented cost saving initiatives related to our fleet and operations offered employees voluntary separation programs and delayed or eliminated nearly all discretionary spending 

during 2021 distribution of vaccines continued travel restrictions and advisories eased and customer confidence continued to grow despite the negative impact of covid19 virus variants in the second half of 2021 as a result we saw revenue and capacity return and related operating expense line items increase the continued restoration of our operations was the primary driver for the increases in contracted services landing fees and other rents passenger commissions and other selling expenses passenger service and other expense other yearoveryear fluctuations are discussed below 

salaries and related costs in the second half of 2020 approximately 18000 employees elected to participate in voluntary separation programs which initially reduced our workforce by approximately 20 though some of those positions have subsequently been filled since the beginning of 2021 we have hired approximately 11000 employees in certain areas including flight operations airport customer service and reservations and customer care in order to support our operations as demand and capacity return 

beginning in march 2020 and continuing through december 2020 we reduced salaries by 100 for our ceo and 50 for our officers in addition we reduced work hours by 25 for all other management and most frontline employee work groups on january 1 2021 employees were restored to full work hours officer salaries were restored and during 2021 we recalled approximately 1700 pilots from inactive status back to active service additionally we offered voluntary unpaid leaves of absence for periods ranging from 30 days up to 12 months and approximately 50000 and 20000 of our employees elected to take a leave of absence at various times throughout 2020 and 2021 respectively these actions resulted in higher salaries and related costs in 2021 compared to 2020

aircraft fuel and related taxes fuel expense increased 25 billion compared to 2020 primarily due to a 44 increase in consumption on a 45 increase in capacity and a 31 increase in the market price of jet fuel 

additionally during 2021 we purchased and retired 95 million of carbon offsets of which 30 million relates to 13 million metric tons of carbon emissions generated by our airline segment from march 1 to december 31 2020 as well as 65 million which relates to a portion of 2021 carbon emissions generated by our airline segment in the table below these costs are shown in the carbon offset costs line item 



1 market price for jet fuel at airport locations including related taxes and transportation costs 

ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations increased expenses were primarily related to refinery sales to third parties which are at or near cost and increased 21 billion compared to 2020 the increase compared to 2020 was driven by higher pricing during 2021 with lower production and demand for both jet and nonjet fuel products during 2020 the cost of aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties increased compared to 2020 due to the increase in flights operated worldwide in 2021 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to the aircraft that were retired or impaired during 2020 as we acquire new aircraft to provide an improved customer experience greater fuel efficiency and thus reduced carbon emissions better operating economics and more premium products we expect depreciation expense to increase in future years 

regional carrier expense regional carrier expense increased compared to 2020 due to an increase in utilization as a result of the increased demand discussed above 

until 2021 we allocated certain costs such as landing fees and other rents salaries and related costs and contracted services to regional carrier expense in our consolidated statements of operations income statement based on relevant statistics such as passenger counts beginning in 2021 we ceased performing this allocation and have reclassified the costs presented in prior periods to align with this presentation this reclassification better reflects the nature of and how management views these regional carrier related expenses this allocation was approximately 900 million in 2020 the amounts in regional carrier expense under the current presentation represent the accrual of payments to our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements maintenance costs related to our regional fleet and the expenses of our wholly owned regional subsidiary endeavor air inc 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs maintenance expense increased compared to 2020 as we returned aircraft to service and to support our operational reliability the increase compared to 2020 was particularly pronounced due to the significantly reduced capacity during 2020 and the large number of aircraft we had parked during that time 

aircraft rent most aircraft operating lease expenses are recorded in aircraft rent and are contractually fixed therefore the increase in aircraft rent was more muted than our other operating expense line items when compared to 2020 

restructuring charges during 2020 we recorded restructuring charges of 82 billion for items such as fleet impairments and voluntary early retirement and separation programs following strategic business decisions in response to the covid19 pandemic in the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized 19 million of adjustments to certain of those restructuring charges representing changes in our estimates see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the restructuring charges recorded in 2020

government grant recognition during the year ended december 31 2021 we received a total of 64 billion under the psp2 and psp3 agreements with the us department of the treasury which we were required to use exclusively for the payment of employee wages salaries and benefits the support payments included grants totaling 45 billion that were recognized as contraexpense in 2021 over the period that the funds were used the amount recognized in 2021 exceeded the amount recognized during 2020 due to the increase in grants received during the year see note 6 of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on psp2 and psp3 

nonoperating results 

interest expense net interest expense net includes interest expense and interest income this increased as a result of the additional interest expense related to financing arrangements entered into during 2020 see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on recent financings and repayments we have begun reducing the total amount of interest expense by prepaying our debt in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities this began with early repayments made during the december 2020 quarter and continued with multiple early repayments during 2021 including the early repayment of our 15 billion secured term loan approximately 450 million of various enhanced equipment trust certificates eetcs approximately 850 million of certain notes through a cash tender offer and 647 million of other secured certificates unsecured notes and a portion of the skymiles term loan through repurchases on the open market we will continue to seek opportunities to prepay our debt in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities during 2022 and beyond 

impairments and equity method losses impairments and equity method losses in 2021 reflect our share of virgin atlantics equity method losses impairments and equity method losses in 2020 reflected our share of latam and grupo aeroméxicos equity method results prior to their respective bankruptcy filings our share of virgin atlantics equity method results and the impairments reducing the basis of these investments to zero during the june 2020 quarter see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our equity investments

our effective tax rate for 2021 was 30 as of december 31 2021  w e had approximately 48 billion of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards of which 11 billion was generated prior to 2018 and will not begin to expire until 2029 under current tax law the remaining amount has no expiration 

for more information about our income taxes see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

refinery segment 

the refinery operated by our whollyowned subsidiary monroe primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel monroe has agreements in place to exchange the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations historically the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 200000 barrels per day or approximately 75 of our precovid19 pandemic consumption for use in our airline operations 

the refinery’s production has also been altered by the dramatic change in economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic during 2021 the refinery progressively increased operations ending the year at near prepandemic levels 



refinery revenues increased from 31 billion in 2020 to 61 billion in 2021 primarily driven by the increase in thirdparty refinery sales the increase in thirdparty refinery sales resulted from the refinerys shift to producing and selling more nonjet fuel products due to the lower level of demand for jet fuel compared to historical levels in addition to higher pricing during 2021 the refinery decreased its operating loss from 216 million in 2020 to 2 million in 2021 mainly due to the increased production and pricing partially offset by higher renewable identification numbers rins compliance costs discussed below 

a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase rins from third parties in the secondary market the monroe refinery purchases the majority of its rins in the secondary market monroe incurred 422 million in rins compliance costs during 2021 of which 98 million related to accrual rate increases on the prior year obligation in addition to 172 million accrued in 2020 observable rin prices increased significantly through the first half of 2021 ending 2021 at nearly double the market price at the end of 2020 

at december 31 2021 we had a net fair value obligation of 497 million our obligation as of december 31 2021 was calculated using the epas proposed renewable fuel standard rfs volume requirements for 2020 and 2021 which were issued in december 2021 the epa has not finalized the compliance deadlines to retire our obligations for 2020 and 2021 but we expect those deadlines to be within one year of the effective date of the new rfs volume requirements

item 7 mda  financial condition and liquidity 

financial condition and liquidity 

as of december 31 2021 we had 142 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities we expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments restricted cash equivalents and cash flows from operations we expect to meet our longterm liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements we are continuing to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity to maintain following the covid19 pandemic though at least in the near term we expect this level to be higher than the liquidity maintained prior to the pandemic by 2024 we expect liquidity to be between 5 billion and 6 billion as we work to reduce our financial obligations and reinvest in the business 

sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

operating activities in 2021 provided 33 billion including funds received from the government support programs described in financing activities below compared to using 38 billion in 2020 we expect to continue generating positive cash flows from operations during 2022 

our operating cash flow is impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months however the reduction in demand for air travel due to the covid19 pandemic resulted in a lower level of advance bookings and the associated cash received than we have historically experienced which has impacted the typical seasonal trend of air traffic liability since march 2020 

domestic demand has improved since the latter half of the march 2021 quarter as consumers have regained confidence to travel and increased ticket purchases for travel further in advance we experienced small moderations in demand growth during parts of the second half of 2021 due to a rise in covid19 cases attributable to covid19 virus variants our air traffic liability remains above historical levels with travel credits representing approximately 45 of the balance as of december 31 2021 this compares to approximately 65 as of december 31 2020 and approximately 20 prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic 

fuel  fuel expense represented approximately 20 of our total operating expense during 2021 the market price for jet fuel is volatile which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations the average fuel price per gallon increased in 2021 as capacity and demand increased throughout the year fuel consumption was higher in 2021 than 2020 as well we expect that fuel consumption will continue to increase throughout 2022 as we return closer to prepandemic levels of demand for air travel partially offset by increases in fuel efficiency of our fleet 

we expect our commitment to environmental sustainability to depend on increased use of saf which is not presently available at scale or at prices competitive to jet fuel while we do not expect a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in the nearterm from the use of saf we are unable to predict the financial impact of increased use of saf on our consolidated financial statements over the longer term as government policies and incentives for and sufficient thirdparty investment in saf are necessary to make its use in larger quantities commercially and economically feasible 

employee benefit obligations we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa and any applicable legislation we had no minimum funding requirements in 2020 or 2021 and have no such requirements in 2022 however we voluntarily contributed 15 billion to these plans during 2021 at this level of funding investment returns are expected to satisfy future benefit payments which we believe would eliminate further material voluntary or required cash contributions to the plans under the terms of erisa further based on this level of funding we have modified and continue to evaluate the asset allocation mix to reduce the investment risk of the portfolio estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and could vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 45 

item 7 mda  financial condition and liquidity 

in addition we have employee benefit obligations relating primarily to projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our employee benefit obligations 

voluntary separation programs in 2020 we recorded a 34 billion charge associated with voluntary early retirement and separation programs and other employee benefit charges approximately 575 million of this charge was disbursed in cash payments to participants during 2021 in addition to 720 million disbursed in 2020 we anticipate that a total of approximately 500 million in cash payments will be made to participants in the voluntary separation programs in 2022 and the remaining payments in 2023 and beyond 

profit sharing our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees we did not have a profit sharing payment for 2020 based on the pretax loss incurred in that year 

to recognize the extraordinary efforts of our employees through the pandemic we will make a special profitsharing payment to eligible employees in february 2022 based on the adjusted pretax profit earned during the second half of 2021 we will pay 108 million in profit sharing in february 2022 

government support programs see financing activities below for discussion of the impact to our liquidity from the government support programs in 2020 and 2021 we included 45 billion and 39 billion of grants received in our operating cash flow for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

contract carrier obligations we have certain estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with thirdparty regional carriers these minimum amounts are based on the required minimum levels of flying by the regional carriers under the respective agreements and assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying as of december 31 2021 the total of these minimum amounts was 117 billion which range from approximately 15 billion to 16 billion on an annual basis over the next five years see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our contract carrier obligations 

operating lease obligations as described further in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2021 we had a total of 98 billion of minimum operating lease obligations these minimum lease payments range from approximately 800 million to 10 billion on an annual basis over the next five years 

new yorkjfk airport expansion in 2015 we completed two phases of redevelopment at new yorkjfks terminal 4 to facilitate convenient connections for our passengers and improve coordination with our skyteam alliance partners terminal 4 is operated by jfk international air terminal llc iat a private party under its lease with the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority in december 2010 we entered into a 33year agreement with iat to sublease space in terminal 4 also in 2010 the port authority issued approximately 800 million principal amount of special project bonds the series 8 bonds to fund the majority of the project in december 2020 the nytdc issued approximately 611 million principal amount of special project bonds to refinance the outstanding balance of the series 8 bonds during 2021 we signed an amendment to the sublease for additional gates at jfk increasing our lease obligation by 12 billion 

we continue to plan for further expansion of terminal 4 and during 2021 the port authority approved modified project plans to renovate terminal 4 and add 10 new gates enabling us to move out of terminal 2 and consolidate our operations at terminal 4 the project is estimated to cost approximately 15 billion and we expect to amend the sublease in the march 2022 quarter construction started in late 2021 with the project estimated to be complete by the end of 2023 

other obligations we have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to aviationrelated maintenance insurance marketing technology sponsorships and other thirdparty services and products as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 80 billion of such obligations which range from approximately 300 million to 800 million on an annual basis over the next five years

capital expenditures our capital expenditures ie property and equipment additions in our consolidated statements of cash flows cash flows statement were 32 billion and 19 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchases of aircraft airport construction projects fleet modifications and technology enhancements 

we have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained but are under no obligation to use longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft excluding the new yorklaguardia airport project discussed below our expected 2022 capital expenditures of approximately 60 billion which may vary depending on financing decisions will be primarily for aircraft including deliveries and advance deposit payments as well as fleet modifications and technology enhancements as described in part i item 1 business  environmental sustainability aircraft fleet renewal is an important component of our environmental sustainability strategy and the path to achievement of our ambitious climate goals which will continue to require extensive capital investment in future periods see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our aircraft purchase commitments which totaled approximately 162 billion as of december 31 2021 

new yorklaguardia redevelopment as part of the terminal redevelopment project at laguardia airport we are partnering with the port authority to replace terminals c and d with a new stateoftheart terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across four concourses connected to a central headhouse the terminal will feature a new larger delta sky club wider concourses more gate seating and nearly double the amount of concessions space than the existing terminals the facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and dropoffpickup areas the design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency construction is underway and is being phased to limit passenger inconvenience due to an acceleration effort that commenced in 2020 completion is expected by 2025 

in connection with the redevelopment during 2017 we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the port authority with a term through 2050 pursuant to the lease agreement as amended to date we will 1 fund through debt issuance and existing cash and undertake the design management and construction of the terminal and certain offpremises supporting facilities 2 receive a port authority contribution of approximately 500 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure 3 be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and 4 have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to port authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers we currently expect our net project cost to be approximately 35 billion and we bear the risks of project construction including any potential cost overruns using funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements we spent approximately 950 million which is primarily reflected in investing activities in our cash flows statement during 2021 bringing the total amount spent on the project to date to approximately 25 billion we expect to spend approximately 750 million during 2022 of which a majority will be paid using cash restricted for airport construction see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt related to this redevelopment project the new york transportation development corporation nytdc special facilities revenue bonds series 2018 and nytdc special facilities revenue bonds series 2020 

in 2019 we opened concourse g the first of four new concourses housing seven of the 37 new gates not only did the new concourse g provide the first direct impact to the delta passenger experience it also represented the first major phasing milestone the next major milestone will be the opening of the headhouse and concourse e which is scheduled for the second quarter of 2022 

los angeles international airport lax construction we executed a modified lease agreement during 2016 with the city of los angeles the city which owns and operates lax and announced plans to modernize upgrade and provide postsecurity connection to terminals 2 and 3 construction is underway which includes a new centralized ticketing and arrival hall a new security checkpoint core infrastructure to support the citys planned airport people mover ramp improvements and a postsecurity connector to the north side of the tom bradley international terminal 

given reduced passenger volumes resulting from the covid19 pandemic we accelerated the construction schedule for this project in 2020 additionally in 2020 we enhanced the project’s scope to include a more customerfriendly design of terminal 3 an expanded delta sky club and baggage system upgrades designed to increase the terminals’ operational efficiency going forward construction is expected to be completed in 2023

critical accounting estimates 

our critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise noted below 

loyalty program 

our skymiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits miles by flying on delta delta connection carriers and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program when traveling customers earn miles primarily based on the passengers loyalty program status fare class and ticket price customers can also earn miles through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies miles are redeemable by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and other participating airlines access to our sky club and other program awards to facilitate transactions with participating companies we sell miles to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines 

the loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations 1 passenger ticket sales earning miles and 2 sale of miles to participating companies 

passenger ticket sales earning miles passenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with 1 miles earned and 2 air transportation which are each considered performance obligations we value each performance obligation on a standalone basis to value the miles earned we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash which is referred to as equivalent ticket value etv our estimate of etv is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed mileage breakage we use statistical models to estimate mileage breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions to the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years we recognize mileage breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed 

at december 31 2021 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 76 billion a hypothetical 10 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of approximately 140 million on total operating revenue recognized for the year ended december 31 2021 

we defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the etv of a mile would have decreased total operating revenue by approximately 60 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred associated with the miles earned 

sale of miles to participating companies customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from three to eleven years during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 total cash sales from marketing agreements related to our loyalty program were 41 billion 29 billion and 42 billion respectively which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations as discussed below 

our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express our agreements with american express provide for joint marketing grant certain benefits to deltaamerican express cobranded credit card holders cardholders and american express membership rewards program participants and allow american express to market its services or products using our customer database cardholders earn miles for making purchases using cobranded cards and certain cardholders may also check their first bag for free are granted discounted access to delta sky club lounges and receive priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on delta additionally participants in the american express membership rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program we sell miles at agreedupon rates to american express which are then provided to their customers under the cobrand credit card program and the membership rewards program 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 50 

item 7 mda  critical accounting estimates 

we account for marketing agreements including those with american express by allocating the consideration to the individual products and services delivered we allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services which generally consist of award travel priority boarding baggage fee waivers lounge access and the use of our brand we determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 etv for the award travel obligation adjusted for mileage breakage 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta 4 brand value using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand and 5 volume discounts provided to certain partners 

we defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight such as baggage fee waivers is recognized as travelrelated services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed revenue allocated to access delta sky club lounges is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations primarily brand value is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered 

the timing of mile redemptions can vary widely however the majority of new miles have historically been redeemed within two years of being earned the loyalty program deferred revenue classified as a current liability represents our current estimate of revenue expected to be recognized in the next twelve months based on projected redemptions while the balance classified as a noncurrent liability represents our current estimate of revenue expected to be recognized beyond twelve months compared to prepandemic levels a larger portion of mile redemptions is projected to occur beyond twelve months and is therefore reflected as a noncurrent liability as of december 31 2021 we will continue to monitor redemptions as the situation evolves 

for additional information on our significant accounting policies related to the loyalty program see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

passenger ticket sales 

we defer sales of passenger tickets to be flown by us or that we sell on behalf of other airlines in our air traffic liability passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused ticket breakage for tickets that we sell on behalf of other airlines we reduce the air traffic liability when consideration is remitted to those airlines the air traffic liability primarily includes sales of passenger tickets with scheduled departure dates in the future and credits which can be applied as payment toward the cost of a ticket travel credits travel credits are typically issued as a result of ticket cancellations prior to their expiration dates we periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and may record adjustments in our income statement these adjustments relate primarily to refunds exchanges ticket breakage transactions with other airlines and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price 

we have experienced significant ticket cancellations particularly in the early months of the pandemic in 2020 during 2020 with the exception of basic economy we eliminated change fees for all tickets originating in north america and waived change fees for tickets originating outside of north america in the march 2021 quarter we announced the extension of the validity of all passenger tickets and travel credits purchased or expiring in 2021 to december 31 2022 which allowed for tickets to be rebooked through december 31 2022 for travel through 2023 in january 2022 we announced that all existing travel credit holders will have until december 31 2023 to rebook their ticket for travel throughout 2024 additionally all delta customers with upcoming 2022 travel or who purchase a ticket in 2022 will also have the flexibility to rebook their ticket through december 31 2023 and travel throughout 2024 

we estimate the value of ticket breakage and recognize revenue at the scheduled flight date our ticket breakage estimates are primarily based on historical experience ticket contract terms and customers’ travel behavior given the impact of the covid19 pandemic on customer behavior and changes made in ticket validity terms as well as the elimination of change fees for most tickets our estimates of revenue that will be recognized from the air traffic liability for unused tickets may vary in future periods travel credits represented approximately 45 of the air traffic liability as of december 31 2021 this compares to approximately 65 as of december 31 2020 and approximately 20 prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic

longlived assets 

our longlived lived assets including flight equipment which consists of aircraft and associated engines and parts operating lease rightofuse rou assets and other longlived assets which have a recorded value of approximately 360 billion at december 31 2021 are recorded in property and equipment net and operating lease rightofuse assets on our balance sheets this value is based on various factors including the assets acquisition costs estimated useful lives salvage values discounted lease payments and lease terms we review flight equipment rou assets and other longlived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired factors which could be indicators of impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleet type level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by thirdparty regional carriers ie the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel and labor costs and other relevant factors if an asset group is impaired the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and our response we made decisions to remove certain aircraft from active service and to early retire certain fleets we evaluated our fleet during 2020 and determined that only the fleet types discussed in note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements were impaired as the future cash flows from the operation of other fleet types through the respective retirement dates exceeded the carrying value this resulted in impairment and other related charges of 44 billion recorded in restructuring charges in our income statement these charges were calculated using level 3 fair value inputs based primarily upon recent market transactions and thirdparty bids which were corroborated with published pricing guides and our assessment of existing market conditions based on industry knowledge the effects of the covid19 pandemic created additional estimation uncertainty as there was a limited market for aircraft and limited data on how the covid19 pandemic affected the fair value of aircraft 

due to the recovery in demand that we have experienced throughout 2021 we decided not to retire any additional aircraft and returned to service a majority of the aircraft that were temporarily parked in 2020 we recorded no further impairments during 2021 as we gained updated information during the year we updated estimates to the 2020 fleetrelated impairment charges and recorded adjustments of 19 million to certain of the restructuring charges during 2021 

following the impairment charges the aggregate net book value of these aircraft as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 was approximately 340 million and 500 million respectively with the reduction in 2021 primarily due to aircraft sales see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding these impairments and related charges 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including certain of the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both comparable public company multiples a market approach and projected discounted future cash flows an income approach when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 3 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 52 

item 7 mda  critical accounting estimates 

key assumptions the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows including the duration and extent of impact to our business and our alliance partners from the covid19 pandemic 2 current discount rates 3 observable market transactions and 4 anticipated changes to the regulatory environment eg changes in slot access andor availability additional open skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals these assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition when performing a qualitative valuation we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinitelived to definitelived factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies global pandemics or other factors 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg changes in slot access andor availability additional open skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion at december 31 2021 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 60 billion at december 31 2021 of which 59 billion related to indefinitelived intangible assets indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements 

in 2021 we performed qualitative assessments of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including applicable factors noted in key assumptions above and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors which impact the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets 

for additional information on our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets significant accounting policies and the related fair values and book values see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals as of december 31 2021 the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheets balance sheets was 16 billion we had no minimum funding requirements in 2020 or 2021 and have no such requirements in 2022 however we voluntarily contributed 15 billion to these plans during 2021 the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy of plan participants 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on highquality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analyses specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 297 and 262 at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 265 to 433 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation our weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2021 was 898 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 53 

item 7 mda  critical accounting estimates 

the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan based on our current level of funding we have modified and continue to evaluate the asset allocation mix to reduce the investment risk of the portfolio the lower risk profile of the portfolio is projected to result in a lower expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in 2022 

the impact of a 050 change in weighted average discount rate and 100 change in expected longterm rate of return on assets are shown in the table below 



life expectancy  changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost we use the society of actuaries soa published mortality data and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy the soa publishes updated mortality tables for us plans and updated improvement scales each year we consider updates by the soa in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations 

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act and any applicable legislation under the pension protection act of 2006 we elected alternative funding rules so that the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an 885 discount rate until the 17year period expires for all frozen defined benefit plans by the end of 2024 upon expiration under recent legislation passed in 2021 any required funding would be amortized over a rolling 15year period and calculated using a discount rate of no less than 475 through 2030 

while this recent legislation makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants 

investments valued at net asset value nav per share on an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments these investments valued using nav as a practical expedient are typically valued on a monthly or quarterly basis by thirdparty administrators valuation agents or fund managers with an annual audit performed by an independent third party but certain of these investments have a lag in the availability of data this primarily applies to private equity private equityrelated strategies and real assets we solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments

income tax valuation allowance 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets we establish valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things projected future taxable income scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results and tax planning strategies in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred income tax assets the significant factors that we consider include 1 our recent history of significant profitability 2 growth in the us and global economies 3 forecast of airline revenue trends 4 estimate of future fuel prices and 5 future impact of taxable temporary differences 

delta air lines inc 2021 form 10k 54 

item 7 mda  critical accounting estimates 

at december 31 2021 our net deferred tax asset balance was 13 billion  including an 833 million valuation allowance primarily related to capital loss carryforwards and certain state net operating losses although we have recent cumulative losses we have a history of significant earnings prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic while we expect to return to sustained profitability as the effects of the pandemic subside and to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards before any expire the generation of future taxable income is dependent on many factors including those which are out of our control such as the demand for air travel and overall health of the economy as such there are no guarantees that a valuation allowance will not be required against some or all of our deferred tax assets in future periods 

our federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before 2018 do not begin to expire until 2029 under current tax law federal net operating losses generated after 2017 do not expire therefore we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and certain state net operating losses that have short expiration periods

we sometimes use information nongaap financial measures that is derived from the consolidated financial statements but that is not presented in accordance with gaap under the us securities and exchange commission rules nongaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding 

included below are reconciliations of nongaap measures used within this form 10k to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures these reconciliations include certain adjustments to gaap measures which are directly related to the impact of covid19 and our response these adjustments are made to provide comparability between the reported periods if applicable as indicated below 

• restructuring charges during 2020 we recorded restructuring charges of 82 billion for items such as fleet impairments and voluntary early retirement and separation programs following strategic business decisions in response to the covid19 pandemic in the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized 19 million of adjustments to certain of those restructuring charges representing changes in our estimates 

• government grant recognition we recognized 45 billion and 39 billion of the grant proceeds from the payroll support program extensions as a contraexpense during 2021 and 2020 respectively we recognized the grant proceeds as contraexpense based on the periods that the funds were intended to compensate and have fully used all proceeds from the payroll support program extensions 

• impairments and equity method losses these adjustments relate to recording our share of losses recorded by our equity method investees additionally during 2020 we recognized charges from writedowns of our investments in latam and grupo aeroméxico following their financial losses and separate chapter 11 bankruptcy filings and the writedown of our investment in virgin atlantic based on our share of its losses 

• pension settlement charges these charges were recognized in connection with the voluntary early retirement and separation programs that were offered to our employees in 2020 

• loss on extinguishment of debt this adjustment relates to the early termination of a portion of our debt 

• special profitsharing payment this adjustment is exclusive to 2021 to recognize the extraordinary efforts of our employees through the pandemic we will make a special profitsharing payment to eligible employees in february 2022 based on the adjusted pretax profit earned during the second half of 2021 this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry 

we also regularly adjust certain gaap measures for the following items if applicable for the reasons indicated below 

• mtm adjustments and settlements on hedges marktomarket   mtm adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period 

• equity investment mtm adjustments we record our proportionate share of losses from our equity investments in nonoperating expense as a result of grupo aeroméxicos and latam’s bankruptcy filings in 2020 we discontinued accounting for these investments under the equity method at that time as we no longer had significant influence with those investees we adjust for our equity method investees hedge portfolio mtm adjustments to allow investors to understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown 

• mtm adjustments on investments unrealized gainslosses result from our equity investments that are accounted for at fair value in nonoperating expense the gainslosses are driven by changes in stock prices foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in companies without publiclytraded shares adjusting for these gainslosses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown

• thirdparty refinery sales refinery sales to third parties and related expenses are not related to our airline segment excluding these sales therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry 

• aircraft fuel and related taxes the volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of yearoveryear financial performance the adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our nonfuel costs and yearoveryear financial performance 

• profit sharing we adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry 

• delta private jets adjustment  because we combined delta private jets with wheels up in january 2020 we have excluded the impact of delta private jets from 2019 results for comparability

item 7a market risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative contracts we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

fuel price risk 

changes in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations a one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately 40 million of additional annual fuel expense based on annual precovid19 pandemic consumption of approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel as a result of the reduced capacity from the covid19 pandemic our jet fuel consumption during 2021 of 28 billion gallons was significantly less than our historical and expected future consumption our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s inventory 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt and lease obligations market risk associated with our fixedrate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value from an increase in interest rates market risk associated with our variablerate debt and variablerate leases relates to the potential negative impact to future earnings from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2021 we had 214 billion of fixedrate debt 39 billion of variablerate debt and 833 million of variablerate leases the rates used in our variablerate debt are based on libor or another index rate which in certain cases is subject to a floor an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate debt by 11 billion at december 31 2021 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate debt and variablerate leases by 24 million 

in march 2021 the administrator of libor announced that the publication of certain libor settings will cease after december 2021 and publication of the remainder of the libor settings will cease after june 2023 at december 31 2021 we had no exposure to the discontinued libor settings and had approximately 39 billion of liborbased debt and finance leases maturing after june 2023 all of which include mechanisms for replacing the applicable reference rate which we do not expect to be materially different from libor 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts 

at december 31 2021 we had a us dollarsouth korean won cross currency swap contract totaling a 1 million asset position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the south korean won in relation to the us dollar would have changed the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contract by 15 million for the year ending december 31 2021

general 

as a global airline based in the us we connect customers across our expansive global network in 2019 we served approximately 200 million customers and were the world’s largest airline by total revenues and the most profitable with five consecutive years of 5 billion or more in pretax income from 2015 through 2019 in 2020 we made significant adjustments to our network and operations as a result of the unprecedented and widespread impact of covid19 and the related travel restrictions and social distancing measures that significantly reduced demand for air travel 

after initially impacting our service to china beginning in january 2020 the spread of covid19 and the resulting global pandemic have significantly affected our entire network beginning in march 2020 large public events were cancelled governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on nonessential activities businesses suspended travel and popular leisure destinations temporarily closed to visitors in the united states which is our primary market the federal government has discouraged travel and encouraged social distancing efforts and limits on gathering size numerous travel advisories and restrictions have been implemented some of which remain in place between the united states and specific countries many foreign governments have also placed restrictions or quarantines on citizens of other countries including citizens of the us flying into their countries for instance the us and numerous other countries are now requiring airline passengers to provide negative covid19 test results prior to travel into their countries state and local governments have also issued travel restrictions quarantines and advisories and healthrelated curfews or “shelter in place” orders which dissuade or restrict air travel as a result demand for travel declined at a rapid pace in the march 2020 quarter and has remained depressed which has had an unprecedented and materially adverse impact on our revenues results of operations and financial position in 2020 we served approximately 70 million customers many of them prior to the pandemic’s onset more information about the effect of the covid19 pandemic on our business can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we remain committed to industryleading safety and reliability and are consistently among the industry’s best performers our people are our strongest competitive advantage our employees provide worldclass travel experiences for our customers and give back to the communities where they live work and serve following the onset of the covid19 pandemic we have intensified our focus on ensuring the safety and health of our customers including through the creation of our global cleanliness organization and implementation of the delta care standard to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized experience across our facilities and aircraft we believe these actions have been an important driver behind the significant increases in our domestic net promoter scores during 2020 other key competitive advantages include our operational reliability our global network and customer loyalty 

in recent years we have diversified revenue streams beyond the basic sale of an airline ticket in an effort to reduce the impact of cyclicality and other significant reductions in air travel demand on our results our partnership with american express continued to provide a cobrand revenue stream tied to broader consumer spending during 2020 our recent focus on premium products and customer segmentation enhanced our revenue growth prior to the pandemic and reduced reliance on the most price sensitive customer segment a differentiator that we believe has benefited us during the pandemic we also maintain complementary portfolio businesses such as our cargo business and our maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” operation where we believe we remain well positioned for organic growth through contractual agreements with jet engine manufacturers

in 2019 we offered more than 5000 daily departures and as many as 15000 affiliated departures including the premier skyteam alliance of which delta is a founding member we generated over 70 of our 2019 passenger revenue from our domestic network centered around highmargin core hubs in atlanta minneapolisst paul detroit and salt lake city these core hub positions complement traditionally strong coastal hub positions in boston los angeles new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk and seattle we have agreements with domestic regional carriers that operate as delta connection ® to feed traffic to our domestic hubs as a result of decreased demand for air travel caused by the covid19 pandemic we significantly reduced our systemwide flight operations including operations at all of the hubs listed above beginning in march 2020 we expect to continue to evaluate and adjust our operations to address evolving conditions 

although our international operations have been substantially curtailed as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continue to serve transatlantic transpacific and latin america markets directly on delta and through joint ventures with global airline partners internationally we have significant hubs and market presence in amsterdam londonheathrow mexico city parischarles de gaulle and seoulincheon 

through innovative alliances with aeroméxico air franceklm china eastern korean air and virgin atlantic and an alliance pending regulatory approval with latam airlines we seek to bring more choice to customers worldwide our strategic relationships with these international airlines are an important part of our business as they improve our access to markets around the world and enable us to provide customers a more seamless global travel experience across our alliance network in 2019 we and our alliance partners collectively served over 140 countries and more than 900 destinations around the world the most significant of these arrangements are commercial joint ventures that include joint sales and marketing coordination colocation of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements in some cases we have reinforced strategic alliances through equity investments where we have opportunity to create deep relationships and maximize commercial cooperation for additional information about the effect of the covid19 pandemic on our investments in these airlines see commercial arrangements with other airlines below and note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2020 our network included a fleet of more than 1100 aircraft that are varied in size and capabilities giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network prior to the pandemic we began refreshing our fleet acquiring new more fuel efficient aircraft with increased premium seating to replace older aircraft and had begun to reduce our fleet complexity with fewer fleet types we accelerated this fleet simplification strategy by retiring 227 aircraft in 2020 with plans to retire an additional 128 aircraft by 2025 

expanded products and services 

over the last decade we have fundamentally transformed our business by investing in our people our product and our reliability to alter the commoditylike nature of air travel we have a retail oriented merchandised approach to distribution with welldefined and differentiated products for our customers through improved product segmentation we offer distinct travel experiences with clear value propositions that enable customer choice and include exceptional service onboard our aircraft in both 2020 and 2019 approximately onethird of our passenger revenue was from premium products which include delta one ®  delta premium select first class and delta comfort ®  main cabin products including basic economy represented approximately half of our passenger revenue in 2020 and 2019 during 2020 we increased the flexibility with respect to these products by extending expiration on certain tickets and travel credits eliminating change fees for domestic tickets and international tickets originating from north america with the exception of basic economy tickets and waiving change fees for all tickets including basic economy purchased before march 30 2021 we derive the remainder of our passenger revenue from loyalty travel awards and travelrelated services 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels with 59 of tickets sold through direct channels in 2020 these include digital channels such as deltacom and the fly delta app and our reservations specialists where we deliver more direct personalized interactions with our customers at reduced distribution costs indirect distribution channels include online travel agencies and traditional brick and mortar agencies we make fare and product information widely available across those channels in an effort to ensure customers receive the best information and service options 

we continue to implement merchandising initiatives across our distribution channels to allow customers to better understand our product offerings make it easier to buy the products they desire and increase customer satisfaction this merchandising effort is most effective in deltas digital channels where customers can compare all product options in a single easy to understand display

customer loyalty program 

the skymiles program is designed to attract lifetime members and grow customer loyalty by offering incentives to increase travel with us our awardwinning program offers a wide variety of benefits including award travel and access to complimentary elite benefits and services when traveling with us and our partners as our brand has strengthened the skymiles program has seen an acceleration in membership growth we believe there is opportunity to continue this trend as we seek to elevate our customer engagement through opportunities to earn and redeem mileage credits “miles” as well as cobrand card offerings coupled with a strong customer experience the skymiles program has a large growing and premium membership base this membership base has historically resulted in higher premium revenues and more resilient cash flows for us skymiles has been widely recognized as a top loyalty program by external reviewers such as us news and world report and the points guy 

the skymiles program provides its members the ability to earn miles when traveling on delta delta connection and our partner airlines miles may also be earned by using certain services offered by program partners such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies to facilitate transactions with participating companies we sell miles to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines in addition individuals may purchase miles they can use these miles for award redemptions such as flights and upgrades on delta our regional carriers and other participating airlines as well as donations with specific charities and more in 2020 and 2019 nearly 10 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel as program members redeemed miles in the loyalty program for approximately 14 million and 20 million award tickets respectively 

our most significant and valuable contract to sell miles relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express in 2019 we amended our primary cobrand agreement and other related agreements with american express the new agreements increase the total benefit we receive and extend the duration of the relationship to 2029

we previously entered into a joint venture agreement with westjet with respect to transborder traffic flows between the us and canada for which we sought antitrust immunity from dot among other regulatory approvals in 2020 we withdrew the application for antitrust immunity and as a result we and westjet are not currently implementing the proposed joint venture we continue to explore avenues to deepen our relationship with westjet and generate value for our customers

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our dl designator code we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail inflight and ancillary revenues associated with the flights under these capacity purchase arrangements we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least ten years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

skywest airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement this proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

global impact 

as we connect people with communities experiences and each other we are committed to doing our part to build a better world giving back to the communities where we live work and serve is part of our culture and we have maintained this commitment through the covid19 pandemic with delta people shifting to virtual platforms and finding innovative new ways to give back for example during 2020 delta supported healthcare workers by manufacturing 70000 face shields to extend the life of n95 mask respirators donated 800000 pounds of snacks and drinks to hospitals in 20 countries and provided more than 350 free flights for medical professionals traveling to assist states that were heavily impacted by the pandemic 

as a purposedriven and valuesled company we are committed to reducing our environmental impact the chief focus of reducing our impact on the environment is jet fuel which is the primary contributor to our carbon footprint in february 2020 we announced plans to invest 1 billion in the next 10 years in our effort to achieve carbon neutrality a commitment we have reiterated even with the unprecedented challenges presented for the airline industry by the covid19 pandemic we continue to focus on increasing fuel efficiency as we replace older aircraft with more fuelefficient jets and improve the efficiency of our existing aircraft through operational efforts 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect the worlds major freight gateways we have historically generated cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft in 2020 following the onset of the covid19 pandemic reduced industry capacity drove a significant increase in our cargo yield and we also generated cargo revenue through the operation of cargoonly charter flights ie using aircraft in our fleet not then being utilized for passenger travel we are a member of skyteam cargo an international airline cargo alliance with 10 other airlines that offer a network spanning six continents and aim to provide solutions across the globe by connecting our network with those of our partners 

related businesses 

we have various other businesses arising from our airline operations including the following 

• in addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of approximately 1100 mainline and regional aircraft our mro operation known as delta techops serves aviation and airline customers from around the world 

• our vacation wholesale subsidiary delta vacations provides vacation packages to thirdparty consumers

item 1 business 

in january 2020 we combined delta private jets a former delta subsidiary that provides aircraft charters aircraft management and programs allowing members to purchase flight time by the hour with wheels up as of december 31 2020 we owned a 24 equity stake in wheels up 

in 2019 the total revenue from these other businesses was approximately 12 billion this revenue was reduced to approximately 650 million in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic and our deconsolidation of delta private jets following the transaction with wheels up 

employee matters 

human capital 

we believe that delta people are our strongest competitive advantage and the highquality service that they provide sets us apart from other airlines as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 74000 people of which approximately 72000 were based in the us in 2020 the dedication and determination of delta people in response to the unprecedented challenges we faced due to the covid19 pandemic enabled us to avoid involuntary furloughs of us employees with approximately 50000 employees volunteering to take unpaid leaves of absence approximately 18000 employees participating in early retirement and voluntary separation programs and from april 1 through december 31 2020 most employees working reduced hours 

our principal human capital management objectives are to attract retain and develop people who understand and are committed to delivering the “delta difference” that is core to our brand to support these objectives our human resources programs seek to 

• prepare our employees for key roles and future leadership positions through a variety of training and development programs 

• reward our people through highly competitive total compensation and benefit programs designed to share our success promote teamwork and support our people’s total wellbeing 

• enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making our workplace more engaging equitable and inclusive 

• drive employees’ professional and community engagement 

the health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving these objectives we have long led the airline industry in employee safety and seek to achieve worldclass personal safety performance 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we created pay protection programs for employees with symptoms diagnosed exposed or at high risk for severe illness from covid19 and established a notification process for potential covid19 exposure we also assembled a covid19 task force to develop a series of safety measures in an effort to protect our employees and customers including offering onsite rapid covid19 testing in most locations and making athome testing available for all usbased employees and offering a returntowork safety training program 

our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion is also critical to effective human capital management at delta as a global airline we are in the business of bringing people together and we believe our business should reflect the diversity of our customer base to achieve this goal we seek diverse talent internally and externally in an effort to achieve broader diverse representation throughout our organization we also promote inclusion through education training and development opportunities as well as by leveraging insights from our business resource groups of which approximately onethird of our employees were members as of december 31 2020 in addition we intend to drive accountability for equitable outcomes by reviewing and revising systems practices and policies and measuring inclusive behaviors practices and representation two key areas on which we are focused are 1 reinforcement of our diverse talent pipeline by among other things requiring hiring candidate slates and interview panels to reflect diversity and giving equal consideration for accessible experience or certifications in an effort to remove unnecessary barriers like college degrees to certain roles and 2 closing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of minority and female officers including doubling the number of black officers by 2025

item 1 business 

we believe that listening engaging and connecting with employees furthers our human capital management objectives we have historically done so primarily through our opendoor policy digital communication across all levels of the company inperson events with senior management and companywide and divisionspecific surveys to evaluate employee satisfaction since march 2020 senior management has participated in weekly companywide virtual town hall discussions with our employees and our chief executive officer has written weekly memos to all employees regarding our response to the covid19 pandemic and our plan to take action on racial justice and diversity we have also continued to conduct periodic employee surveys to seek feedback on wellbeing communication and our covid19 response 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2020 23 of our approximately 74000 fulltime equivalent employees were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



we are in mediated discussions with the representative of the delta pilots regarding terms of their amendable collective bargaining agreement under the auspices of the national mediation board nmb 

in addition to the domestic airline employee groups discussed above approximately 190 refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2022 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act nlra which generally allows either party to engage in selfhelp upon the expiration of the agreement certain of our employees outside the us are represented by unions work councils or other local representative groups 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations 

the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs which were materially reduced in 2020 in large part due to our reduced operations in response to the covid19 pandemic 



1 includes the operations of our regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements 

2 includes the impact of fuel hedge activity and refinery segment results

monroe energy 

our wholly owned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively monroe operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk these companies are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers we own monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our new york operations 

refinery operations  the facility is capable of refining approximately 200000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined petroleum products nonjet fuel products monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers during 2020 the refinery operated at 60 – 90 of normal production levels largely due to the significant decrease in the demand for jet fuel additionally due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel the refinery has shifted production to produce more nonjet fuel products 

strategic agreements monroe has agreements in place to exchange the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations 

fuel hedging program 

our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s inventory we may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency operational reliability services products customer service and loyalty programs the industry has evolved through mergers and new entry both domestically and internationally and evolution in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the presence of subsidized government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with significant financial resources extensive global networks and competitive cost structures the covid19 pandemic could enhance the competitive dynamics within the industry although we are unable to predict the duration and extent of this potentially increased pressure 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines frontier airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by delta pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers including from pointtopoint carriers on certain international routes through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have enhanced competition in international markets 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 9 

item 1 business 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including several of our joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and qantas 

competition from governmentowned and subsidized carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways is also significant subsidies allowed these carriers to grow quickly prior to the covid19 pandemic reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the faa exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo since the passage of the airline industry deregulation act in 1978 airlines have generally been free to launch or terminate service to us airports without restriction except with respect to certain slotcontrolled and schedulefacilitated airports as well as certain constraints related to service to small communities governed by the essential air services program the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act of 2020 created certain continuation of service obligations in connection with the receipt of payroll support program funds by passenger airlines specifically the dot has the authority until march 1 2022 to require airlines that received such funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before march 1 2020 the dot has issued two orders mandating such service the most recent of which was finalized on january 15 2021 mandating service levels through march 31 2021 subject to certain definitions and exceptions as described in the order 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers the dot engages in regulation of economic matters such as transactions involving allocation of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at airports where such mechanisms are in place the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act with oversight by the nmb environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 10 

item 1 business 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia and jfk in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos haneda airport londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

airline labor regulation 

labor unions representing airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the nmb an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for representation a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day cooling off period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “selfhelp” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board peb to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the status quo for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in self help selfhelp includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline the us congress and the president have the authority to prevent selfhelp by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties

environmental regulation and related matters 

our operations are subject to a number of international federal state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions noise reduction water discharges aircraft drinking water storage and use of petroleum and other regulated substances and the management and disposal of hazardous waste substances and materials 

emissions  carbon emissions by the aviation industry and their impact on climate change have become a particular focus in the international community and within the us for several years the european union has required its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its emissions trading scheme ets under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the ets was amended to apply only to flights within the european economic area from 2013 through 2016 in 2017 the eu extended the exemption for foreign flights through 2023 based on the international civil aviation organization’s icao adoption of a global marketbased program 

in 2016 icao formally adopted a global marketbased emissions offset program known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia this program establishes a mediumterm goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 based on a 2019 baseline a pilot phase of the offset program will begin in 2021 followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027 countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase and the united states has agreed to participate in these voluntary phases participation in the second phase is mandatory for certain countries including the united states the us government has not yet enacted legislation to mandate that us operators participate in corsia however delta submitted our corsia emissions monitoring plan to the faa in 2019 and in 2020 submitted our verified emissions report for 2019 international emissions in 2017 icao also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide co2 emissions from aircraft the new aircraft certification standards apply to new fleet types in 2020 and to new inproduction aircraft starting in 2023 but no later than 2028 these standards will not apply to existing inservice aircraft however exemption from the certification requirement could affect how these aircraft are treated under other programs governing co2 emissions 

in 2016 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final finding under the clean air act that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and further determined that certain classes of aircraft engines cause or contribute to greenhouse gases the endangerment finding did not establish standards but triggered an obligation for the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain aircraft engines in january 2021 the epa finalized greenhouse gas emission standards for new aircraft engines designed to implement the icao standards on the same timeframe contemplated by icao like the icao standards the final epa standards would not apply to engines on inservice aircraft the final standards have been challenged by several states and environmental groups and the biden administration has announced plans to review these final standards along with others issued by the prior administration the outcome of the legal challenge and administrative review cannot be predicted at this time 

the airline industry may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions additional regulation could result in taxation regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations certain airports have also adopted and others could in the future adopt greenhouse gas emission or climaterelated goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such developments 

in february 2020 we announced plans to invest 1 billion in the next ten years in our effort to achieve carbon neutrality as part of this plan we seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations and build on the reductions realized since 2005 we have improved the fuel efficiency of our aircraft through the retirement of older aircraft and their replacement with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop sustainable alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us to further reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment beyond carbon reduction efforts we expect carbon removal through investment in innovative projects and technologies and stakeholder engagement through coalitions intended to advance carbon reduction to be important aspects of our journey to carbon neutrality

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas and other air emissions 

under the energy policy act of 2005 as expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 the renewable fuel standard rfs was created setting up specific targets of renewable fuel to be used in the us economy by mandating the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases primarily in response to predictions about what the epa andor the us congress will do with respect to compliance obligations 

other environmental matters  we are subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites soil andor ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address these impacts we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the craf program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2022  the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951

item 1a risk factors 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the following material risk factors applicable to delta as described below these risks could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future 

risk factors relating to delta 

the rapid spread of the covid19 virus the persistence of the resulting pandemic and measures implemented to combat it have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business moreover the longer the pandemic persists the more material the ultimate effects are likely to be it is likely that there will be future negative effects that we cannot presently predict including near term effects 

the rapid spread of covid19 and the persistence of the resulting pandemic as well as the measures governments and private parties have implemented in order to stem the spread of this pandemic have had and are continuing to have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and consequently upon our business among other effects of the covid19 pandemic affecting air travel and our business 

• in the united states which is our primary market the federal government has discouraged travel and encouraged social distancing efforts and limits on gathering size 

• numerous travel advisories and restrictions have been implemented some of which remain in place between the united states and specific countries and many foreign governments have placed restrictions or quarantines on citizens of other countries including citizens of the us flying into their countries for instance the us and numerous other countries are now requiring airline passengers to provide negative covid19 test results prior to travel into their countries 

• state and local governments have issued travel restrictions quarantines and advisories and healthrelated curfews or “shelter in place” orders which dissuade or restrict air travel 

• employers in both the public and private sectors have issued instructions to employees to work from home andor are otherwise dissuading or restricting air travel 

• business conventions and conferences concerts and similar entertainment have been and continue to be cancelled many popular tourist destinations have been and remain closed or operations are curtailed significant sporting events have been and occasionally continue to be cancelled or held with limited or no spectators all of these adjustments reduce the demand for both business air travel which has historically driven our most profitable ticket sales and leisure air travel 

• travelers are discouraged from air travel to destinations where covid19 is particularly virulent 

• widespread consumer confidence in air travel may not return until largescale vaccination has occurred and contagion or virusrelated deaths linked or alleged to be linked to travel on aircraft whether accurate or not may hinder restoration of this confidence and if related to our aircraft injure our reputation 

• travelers may be dissuaded from flying due to possible enhanced covid19related screening measures which have been implemented to varying degrees and in different ways across multiple markets we serve or due to the concern that additional travel restrictions implemented between their departure and return may affect their ability to return to their homes 

these effects related to the covid19 pandemic are negatively impacting air travel in general which in turn are materially adversely affecting our revenues results of operations and financial condition although certain of the restrictions above have eased in some places the ongoing pandemic including large outbreaks resurgences of covid19 in various regions and appearances of new variants of the virus has resulted and may continue to result in their reinstitution the effectiveness of the available vaccines against certain of these new variants is also unknown moreover additional currently unknown restrictions or other events dissuading air travel may occur in the future as a result of the pandemic including possibly in the near term lengthening the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business for example the federal government is contemplating whether to require covid19 testing in advance of domestic travel 

our operations have been and could in the future be negatively affected further if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to covid19 or if they are subject to additional governmental covid19 curfews or “shelter in place” health orders or similar restrictions measures restricting the ability of our airport or inflight employees to come to work may cause a further deterioration in our service or operations all of which could negatively affect our business 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 14 

item 1a risk factors 

in response to the crisis we have taken steps to mitigate the effects on our business which themselves may have negative consequences with respect to our business and operations for example we have significantly reduced our flight capacity and have blocked middle seats on flights through at least april 30 2021 however the cost savings achievable with temporary capacity reductions will not completely eliminate the costs related to unused capacity in addition to protect the safety of our employees and customers we have implemented significant additional cleaning measures on all of our aircraft and at the airports in which we operate 

furthermore we have waived air travel booking change fees to a broad extent and extended the ability to rebook that travel through december 2022 in order to encourage travelers to book air travel or not cancel already booked travel despite the inherent uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic despite these efforts we have experienced significant ticket cancellations cancellations the waiver and in many cases elimination of change fees and other refunds have negatively affected our revenues and liquidity 

ultimately costsaving measures that we implemented in 2020 or may consider in the future have not made up and will not in the future makeup for the loss in cash as a result of decreased ticket sales and cancellations and could also negatively affect our service to customers the pandemic is also having a material adverse effect on third parties whose services we utilize including other carriers with which we have commercial relationships international carriers and regional carriers in the delta connection program and providers of ground services at some airports which may also negatively affect our service to customers 

we are unable to predict how long conditions related to the pandemic will persist when effective vaccines will be broadly available when vaccination will be widespread globally when travel advisories and restrictions will be lifted what additional measures may be introduced by governments or private parties or what effect any such additional measures may have on air travel and our business the overall situation remains fluid and it is impossible to predict the timing of future material developments and whether they will occur in the near medium or long term depending on the duration of the pandemic such negative developments may occur over the entirety of the pandemic 

at this time we are also not able to predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may result in permanent changes to our customers behavior with such changes including but not limited to a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of increased usage of virtual meetings and teleconferencing products and more broadly a general reluctance to travel by consumers each of which could have a material impact on our business 

collectively the foregoing circumstances have had and are continuing to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition future disease outbreaks or similar public health threats could have similar effects 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this form 10k and in other filings we make from time to time with the sec 

we have a significant amount of fixed obligations and incurred significant amounts of new debt in a short period in response to the covid19 pandemic insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business 

we have a significant amount of existing fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in response to the effects that the covid19 pandemic is having on our business we have incurred and may continue to seek significant amounts of additional liquidity through the issuance of debt securities or through bilateral and syndicated secured andor unsecured credit facilities and through the entry into saleleaseback transactions in addition we have substantial commitments for capital expenditures 

we had approximately 167 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities liquidity as of december 31 2020 however our future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this form 10k and in other filings we may make from time to time with the sec if our liquidity is materially diminished we might not be able to timely pay our leases and debts or comply with certain financial covenants in our financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of our contractual obligations

our debt agreements contain various affirmative negative and financial covenants including our credit facilities and our skymiles financing agreements each of which contains a minimum liquidity covenant certain of our debt agreements also contain collateral coverage ratios and our skymiles financing agreements contain a debt service coverage ratio a decline in these coverage ratios including due to factors that are beyond our control could require us to post additional collateral or trigger an early amortization event our skymiles financing agreements also restrict our ability to among other things change the policies and procedures of the skymiles program in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially impair repayment of our skymiles debt 

complying with certain of the covenants in our debt agreements and other restrictive covenants that may be contained in any future debt agreements could limit our ability to operate our business and to take advantage of business opportunities that are in our longterm interest the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants 

while the covenants in our debt agreements are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with them and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment refinance the indebtedness subject to these covenants or take other mitigating actions an event of default would result these arrangements also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders or noteholders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and where applicable and subject to the terms of relevant collateral agreements repossess collateral including aircraft or other valuable assets in addition an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one agreement could result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements the acceleration of significant indebtedness could require us to seek to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under our financing arrangements and there is no assurance that such renegotiation or refinancing efforts would be successful 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners 

an aircraft crash or other serious accident involving our aircraft or those of our airline partners could expose delta to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient 

in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety and reliability for aviation authorities and the public which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

breaches or lapses in the security of the technology systems we use and rely on and the data stored within them could compromise sensitive information and expose us to liability possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

as a regular part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including information necessary for our operations personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

our information systems and those of our service providers are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks and the increase in workfromhome arrangements since the onset of the covid19 pandemic has the potential to enhance these risks we expect unauthorized parties to continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or information or those of our business partners and service providers including through fraud or other means of deception or introduction of malicious code such as viruses worms trojan horses and ransomware if successful these actions could cause harm to our computer systems or compromise data stored on our computer networks or those of our business partners and service providers hardware or software we or our business partners or service providers develop acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security for example we were notified in 2018 that a thirdparty vendor of chat services for delta and other companies determined we had been involved in a cyber incident for a short period in 2017 we have incurred remedial legal and other costs in connection with this incident but the costs are not material to our financial position or results of operations 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 16 

item 1a risk factors 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time as a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data in addition to continuously assessing risk and reviewing our procedures processes and technologies we continue to educate our people about these risks and to monitor review and update the process and control requirements we expect third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of information regarding our customers employees or business partners that is in their care however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all information security breaches or misuse of data 

the compromise of our or our business partners’ or service providers’ technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to our information or that of our customers employees or business partners or failure to comply with everevolving regulatory obligations or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business the costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material in addition as cybercriminals become more sophisticated the cost of proactive defensive measures continues to increase 

disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend such as power telecommunications or the internet the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers and other security issues a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our information technology infrastructure including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our operations and our customer service result in increased costs and damage our reputation while we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans including the creation of a backup data center and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans we have previously experienced infrastructure disruptions and these measures may not be adequate to prevent a future business disruption and any material adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

failure of the technology we use to perform effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example substantially all of our tickets are issued to our customers as electronic tickets and a growing number of our customers check in using our website airport kiosks and our mobile device applications we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as deltacom mobile device applications inflight wireless internet checkin kiosks customer service applications application of biometric technology airport information displays and related initiatives including security for these initiatives we are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems and transitioning to cloudbased technologies the performance reliability and security of the technology we use are critical to our ability to serve customers if this technology does not perform effectively including as a result of the implementation or integration of new or upgraded technologies or systems our business and operations would be negatively affected which could be material 

our commercial relationships with airlines in other parts of the world and the investments that we have in certain of those carriers may not produce the results or returns we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to develop and expand strategic relationships with a number of airlines through joint ventures and other forms of cooperation and support including equity investments we expect to continue exploring ways to deepen our alliance relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these relationships and investments involve significant challenges and risks including that they may not generate the expected financial results or that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 17 

item 1a risk factors 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the operations of our airline partners and could adversely affect the expansion of strategic relationships in the future these carriers have incurred significant financial losses as a result of the pandemic and some have been or may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws for example since the onset of the pandemic latam airlines and grupo aeroméxico filed voluntary proceedings to reorganize under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code virgin australia entered voluntary administration in australia in order to recapitalize its business and repudiated our joint venture agreement and virgin atlantic undertook a voluntary recapitalization process in the uk and instituted ancillary proceedings in support of that process in the us as discussed further in note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the effects of the covid19 pandemic along with these actions caused us to reduce our carrying value in the equity investments we have in certain of these carriers to zero if any airline partners that seek to restructure are unable to do so successfully or if our commercial arrangements with these partners are not maintained any investments or other assets associated with those partners could become impaired and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

a significant disruption in or other problems with respect to the operations or performance of third parties on which we rely including thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely on the operations and performance of third parties in a number of areas that are important to our business including thirdparty regional carriers international alliance partners and ground operation providers at some airports while we have agreements with certain of these third parties that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations to the extent that the operations of a third party on which we rely is significantly disrupted or if these third parties experience significant performance issues including failing to satisfy any applicable performance standards or fail to meet any applicable compliance requirements our revenue may be reduced our expenses may be increased and our reputation may be harmed any or all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or our longlived assets causing us to record impairments that may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards we are required to test our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment in addition we are required to test certain of our other assets for impairment where there is any indication that an asset may be impaired during the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 we recorded significant impairment and related charges related to acceleration of our fleet simplification strategy and the writedown of investments in certain airline partners stemming from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

we may be required to recognize losses in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets government regulatory changes decline in the fair values of certain tangible or intangible assets such as aircraft route authorities and airport slots unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties a further impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2020 23 of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted the collective bargaining agreement with our pilots became amendable on december 31 2019 and we are in discussions with the representative of the pilots regarding terms of the agreement under the auspices of the nmb separately the nlra governs monroe’s relations with the union representing their employees which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 18 

item 1a risk factors 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters or other environmental events can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in our international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality results of operations for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a future period and results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for an entire year 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel over the last decade fuel prices have been highly volatile and at times have increased substantially from 2017 to 2020 our average annual fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges has varied from 164 to 220 with year to year variations ranging from a decrease of 19 to an increase of 31 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we have historically purchased a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

the competitive nature of the airline industry may affect our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers in addition because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase at times in the past we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or taxes changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a significant amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 19 

item 1a risk factors 

if monroes cost of producing nonjet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results if insurance is unable to cover a significant liability in addition such an incident could damage our reputation 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position in addition because of our ownership of monroe the occurrence of an environmental or other incident could result in damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroe’s operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions which are subject to change over time monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results in addition the enactment of new more stringent environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

in particular under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandates the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rin requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases primarily in response to predictions about what the epa andor the us congress will do with respect to compliance obligations we cannot predict these actions or the future prices of rins during 2020 monroes operating loss was driven in part by an increase in rins prices monroe’s purchase of rins at elevated prices in the future could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroe’s products could limit the refinery’s production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and we are not able to replace these persons with individuals with comparable skills or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified senior management and other key personnel as needed in the future 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 20 

item 1a risk factors 

significant damage to our reputation and brand including as a result of significant adverse publicity could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

maintaining our reputation and global brand are critical to our business we operate in a highly visible public environment with significant realtime exposure to traditional and social media adverse publicity whether justified or not can rapidly spread including through social or digital media in particular passengers can use social media to portray interactions with delta without context in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent we are unable to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to adverse publicity our brand and reputation may be damaged 

our reputation and brand could also be adversely impacted by among other things failure to make progress toward and achieve our environmental sustainability and diversity equity and inclusion goals as well as public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies or negative public perception of the environmental impact of air travel significant damage to our reputation and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or the fear or threat of any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business despite significant security measures at airports and airlines the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups we rely on government provided threat intelligence and utilize private sources to constantly monitor for threats from terrorist groups and individuals including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry in addition the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant security events primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or the fear or threat of any of these events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds in addition potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring or could occur such as flight redirections or cancellations reputational harm and other costs if any or all of these types of events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and results from operations will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency operational reliability services products customer service and loyalty programs consolidation in the airline industry changes in international alliances the creation of immunized joint ventures and the rise of subsidized government sponsored international carriers have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures the covid19 pandemic could enhance the competitive dynamics within the industry although we are unable to predict the duration or extent of this potentially increased pressure 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines frontier airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by delta pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers including from pointtopoint carriers on certain international routes through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory competition from governmentowned and subsidized carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways has also been significant subsidies allowed these carriers to grow quickly prior to the pandemic reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

the airline industry also faces competition from surface transportation and technological alternatives such as “virtual” meetings or “teleconferencing” and the intensity of this competition has likely increased at least in the near term as a result of the covid19 pandemic increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

item 1a risk factors 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate or significant problems associated with a type of aircraft or engine we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

similarly the airline industry is heavily dependent on a limited number of aircraft and engine manufacturers whose products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements any significant problems associated with an aircraft or engine type that we operate such as design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public leading to customer avoidance or adverse actions by the faa resulting in grounding could have a negative impact on our operations if we are not able to substitute or replace the affected aircraft or engine type and could in any event have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which is costly and could materially adversely affect our business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs and may have material adverse effects on our business for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations reduce revenues or otherwise impact our business the industry is heavily taxed additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

airport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations or otherwise adversely affect an airline’s business certain of our hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been and could in the future be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day air traffic control inefficiencies can also enhance these pressures 

in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system which is regulated by the faa has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as an international carrier we are subject to a wide variety of us and foreign laws that affect trade including tariff and trade policies export and import requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges in connection with a dispute brought at the world trade organization against the eu and certain member states to address state subsidies in the large civil aircraft sector the us trade representative has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from the eu including on certain new aircraft and certain airplane parts originating in france and germany we are pursuing strategies to minimize the impact if any of these tariffs on our business but they or the imposition of future tariffs have the potential to substantially increase the cost to delta of the affected aircraft which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition some of our operations are in highrisk legal compliance environments failure to comply with trade sanctions the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and other applicable laws or regulations could result in litigation assessment of damages imposition of penalties or other consequences any or all of which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial results in certain circumstances we also may be subject to consequences of the failure of our airline partners to comply with laws and regulations including us laws to which they may be subject such as the fcpa 

we and other us carriers are subject to us and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies have updated privacy regulations applicable to private industry including airlines ongoing compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 23 

item 1a risk factors 

the airline industry is subject to many forms of environmental regulation including increased regulation to reduce emissions and other risks associated with climate change failure to comply with existing or future environmental regulations or to otherwise manage the risks of climate change effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business 

many aspects of our operations are subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws governing the protection of the environment compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations could require capital investment and increase operational costs and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry in order to address aircraft carbon dioxide emissions the international civil aviation organization a united nations specialized agency formally adopted a global marketbased emission offset program known as corsia this program establishes a mediumterm goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 based on a 2019 baseline certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted at this time however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally 

in addition to corsia we may face a patchwork of regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and could become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions additional regulation could result in taxation regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for the airline industry including delta in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations while the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the us or other countries could impose significant additional costs on or otherwise adversely affect our operations certain airports have also adopted and others could in the future adopt greenhouse gas emission or climaterelated goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure 

finally there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow us to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide 

because of the global nature of our business unfavorable economic or political conditions in the markets in which we operate or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally our business is subject to economic and political conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the economy in the us or abroad including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the worldwide response to it demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

our international operations are an important part of our route network political disruptions and instability around the world can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel additionally any deterioration in global trade relations such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the unprecedented widespread and persistent impact of covid19 and the related travel restrictions and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world have significantly reduced demand for air travel after initially impacting our service to china beginning in january 2020 the spread of the virus and the resulting global pandemic have significantly affected our entire network beginning in march 2020 large public events were cancelled governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on nonessential activities businesses suspended travel and popular leisure destinations temporarily closed to visitors certain countries that are key markets for our business have imposed bans on international travelers for specified periods or indefinitely 

as a result demand for travel declined at a rapid pace in the march 2020 quarter and has remained depressed which has had an unprecedented and materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position although demand has improved at a slow pace since that time it remains significantly below prepandemic levels the exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain as certain markets have reopened some of which have since experienced a resurgence of covid19 cases while others particularly international markets remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines for most us residents the us and numerous other countries are now also requiring airline passengers to provide negative covid19 test results prior to travel into their countries additionally some states have instituted travel restrictions advisories or quarantines for travelers from other states within the us we expect the demand environment to remain depressed until effective vaccines become broadly available vaccination becomes widespread globally and travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease our forecasted expense and liquidity management initiatives may be modified as the demand environment evolves 

in response to these developments we have implemented enhanced measures focusing on the safety of our customers and employees while at the same time seeking to mitigate the impact on our financial position and operations and to position our business for recovery 

taking care of our customers and employees the safety of our customers and employees is our primary focus as the covid19 pandemic has progressed we have taken numerous steps to help promote the safety of our customers and employees on the ground and in the air in keeping with current healthexpert recommendations including 

• adopting new cleaning procedures on all flights including regular disinfectant electrostatic spraying on aircraft and sanitizing hightouch areas like tray tables entertainment screens armrests and seatback pockets 

• taking steps to help employees and customers practice social distancing and promote safety including 

◦ creating a global cleanliness division to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized experience across our facilities and aircraft 

◦ beginning in may 2020 requiring all customers and customerfacing employees to wear masks 

◦ capping load factors throughout our aircraft and blocking middle seats through at least april 30 2021 

◦ modifying our boarding and deplaning processes while providing limited food and beverage service that is designed to reduce physical touch points 

◦ encouraging social distancing throughout all aspects of our operation 

◦ implementing significant workforce social distancing and protection measures including reconfiguring call center spaces to promote social distancing increasing cleaning and disinfecting of our facilities and encouraging employees to work remotely when possible 

• giving customers flexibility to plan and rebook travel including extending expiration on certain tickets and travel credits through december 2022 eliminating change fees for domestic tickets and international tickets originating from north america with the exception of basic economy tickets and waiving change fees for all tickets purchased before march 30 2021 additionally we are extending 2020 medallion status an additional year rolling medallion qualification miles into 2021 and extending delta skymiles american express card benefits and delta sky club memberships

• offering pay protection to employees who have tested positive for covid19 who must quarantine due to exposure to covid19 who are considered being at highrisk for illness from covid19 according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines and do not have the ability to work remotely 

• offering onsite rapid covid19 testing in most locations and making athome testing available for all usbased employees we have also added rapid testing in most us hubs for active flight crews 

capacity reductions beginning in the second half of march 2020 we experienced a precipitous decrease in demand as covid19 spread throughout the world while we have increased capacity compared to the lowest levels in april 2020 system capacity remains significantly lower than prior to the covid19 pandemic during 2020 system capacity was reduced approximately 50 compared to 2019 with international capacity reduced by approximately 65 and domestic capacity reduced by approximately 45 system capacity for the march 2020 through december 2020 period excluding the prepandemic months of january and february was reduced by approximately 60 with international capacity reduced by approximately 75 and domestic capacity reduced by approximately 50 for the march 2021 quarter system capacity is expected to be down approximately 3040 compared to the march 2019 quarter as a result of reduced demand and lower capacity we retired 227 aircraft in 2020 and have temporarily parked approximately 125 aircraft as of december 31 2020 

expense management in response to the reduction in revenue we have implemented and will continue to implement cost saving initiatives including the following in 2020 

• reducing capacity as described above to align with expected demand which has resulted in removing from active service approximately 350 aircraft as of december 31 2020 including certain fleets or aircraft that we have decided to early retire as described below 

• consolidating our footprint at our airport facilities including temporarily closing some delta sky clubs 

• avoiding furloughs for our us employees and reducing employeerelated costs through the following 

◦ voluntary unpaid leaves of 30 days to 12 months offered to most employees approximately 50000 of our employees have taken or have elected to take voluntary leaves at various times during 2020 and for those taking leaves up to 12 months continuing through 2021 

◦ offering employees early retirement and voluntary separation programs with approximately 18000 employees electing to participate see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

◦ reaching an agreement with alpa that protects our pilots from furlough through april 2022 

◦ from april 1 through december 31 2020 salary reductions of 100 for our ceo 50 for our officers and a 25 reduction in work hours for all other management and most frontline employee work groups 

• delaying or eliminating nearly all other discretionary spending 

balance sheet cash flow and liquidity our cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities liquidity as of december 31 2020 was 167 billion as a result of the following actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position during the year ended december 31 2020

government support programs 

on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was enacted into law the cares act is a support package intended to assist many aspects of the american economy including providing the airline industry with up to 25 billion in grants and loans to be used for employee wages salaries and benefits 

in april 2020 we entered into an agreement with the us department of the treasury to receive emergency support through the cares act payroll support program which totaled 56 billion the support payments were conditioned on our agreement to comply with a variety of conditions including to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through september 30 2020 the support payments consisted of 40 billion in a grant and 16 billion in an unsecured 10year low interest loan the loan bears interest at an annual rate of 100 for the first five years through april 2025 and the secured overnight financing rate sofr plus 200 in the final five years in return we issued to the us department of the treasury warrants to acquire more than 67 million shares of delta common stock which represented approximately 1 of our outstanding shares these warrants have an initial exercise price of 2439 per share subject to adjustment in certain cases and a fiveyear term 

the relative fair value of the warrants issued in 2020 is recorded within stockholders equity and as a discount reducing the carrying value of the loan which is being amortized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations income statement over the term of the loan the proceeds of the 2020 cares act grant were recorded in cash and cash equivalents when received and were recognized as contraexpense in government grant recognition in our income statement over the periods that the funds were intended to compensate see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the unsecured loan and warrants to acquire delta shares issued under the cares act payroll support program 

finally the cares act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020 with 50 of the deferred amount due december 31 2021 and the remaining 50 due december 31 2022 this provided us with approximately 200 million of additional liquidity during 2020 

on december 27 2020 an additional covid19 support bill was enacted into law which extends the payroll support program of the cares act and provides an additional 15 billion in grants and loans to be used for airline employee wages salaries and benefits in january 2021 we entered into a payroll support program extension agreement with the us department of the treasury we expect to receive 29 billion in payroll support payments which must be used exclusively for the payment of employee wages salaries and benefits and are conditioned on our agreement to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs from the date of the extension agreement through march 2021 other conditions include prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through march 2022 and certain limitations on executive compensation until october 2022 the department of transportation also has the authority until march 1 2022 to require airlines that received payroll support program funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before march 1 2020 

the expected support payments consist of approximately 20 billion in grants and 830 million in an unsecured 10year low interest loan we received the first installment of 14 billion under the agreement on january 15 2021 and expect to receive the balance in the march 2021 quarter the loan bears interest at an annual rate of 100 for the first five years through january 15 2026 and the applicable sofr plus 200 in the final five years approximately 70 of the payment received on january 15 2021 was in the form of a grant and approximately 30 was in the form of an unsecured loan we issued a promissory note for approximately 400 million with respect to the term loan which will increase to its full principal amount as the balance of payroll support payments is received in connection with receipt of these payments we also expect to issue to the us department of the treasury warrants to acquire shares of delta common stock which we expect to be approximately 21 million shares representing less than 05 of our outstanding shares approximately onehalf of the expected warrants were issued on january 15 2021 and the remaining warrants will be issued as the balance of payroll support payments is received these warrants have an initial exercise price of 3973 per share subject to adjustment in certain cases and a fiveyear term

financial highlights  2020 compared to 2019 

our pretax loss for 2020 was 156 billion representing a 218 billion decrease compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business which resulted in a 64 decrease in revenue and 82 billion of restructuring charges and 24 billion in investment impairments and equity method losses pretax loss adjusted a nongaap financial measure was 90 billion a decrease of 152 billion compared to the prior year adjustments for 2020 were primarily related to restructuring charges from fleet retirement decisions voluntary early retirement and separation programs charges and investment impairments and equity method losses which were partially offset by recognition of the cares act grant 

revenue compared to 2020 our operating revenue decreased 299 billion or 64 due to reduced demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

operating expense total operating expense decreased 108 billion or 27 compared to the prior year primarily resulting from lower volume and sellingrelated expenses including fuel lower profit sharing recognition of the cares act payroll support program grant and significant cost reduction measures taken across all aspects of our operation in response to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by restructuring charges total operating expense adjusted a nongaap financial measure decreased 160 billion or 40 compared to the prior year 

our total operating cost per available seat mile casm increased 50 to 2201 cents compared to the prior year primarily due to the 51 decrease in capacity which was partially offset by the significant cost reduction measures discussed above nonfuel unit costs casmex a nongaap financial measure increased 43 to 1561 cents and consolidated casm adjusted a nongaap financial measure which includes aircraft fuel costs increased 23 to 1796 cents 

nonoperating results total nonoperating expense was 31 billion in 2020 27 billion higher than the prior year primarily resulting from impairments and our proportionate share of equity method losses related to our investments in latam grupo aeroméxico and virgin atlantic and higher interest expense as a result of our increased debt balances due to the financing arrangements entered into during 2020 

cash flow our liquidity at december 31 2020 was 167 billion a 108 billion increase compared to december 31 2019 as a result of proceeds from loans and debt issuances including our skymiles financing arrangements and aircraft financings support payments under the cares act payroll support program and other liquidity initiatives losses during 2020 resulted in operating activities using 38 billion during 2020 we incurred 92 billion of investing cash outflows primarily related to the purchase of shortterm investments and our tender offer to acquire shares of latam in january 2020 these results generated 43 billion of negative free cash flow a nongaap financial measure in 2020 compared to 42 billion of free cash flow in 2019

operating revenue 

compared to the year ended december 31 2019 our operating revenue decreased 299 billion or 64 due to reduced demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic the decrease in operating revenue on a 51 decrease in capacity generated a 25 decrease in total revenue per available seat mile trasm and a 30 decrease in trasm adjusted compared to 2019 the increase in thirdparty refinery sales resulted from the refinerys shift to producing more nonjet fuel products due to the decline in demand for jet fuel see refinery segment below for additional details on the refinerys operations during 2020 

we have historically generated cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft in 2020 following the onset of the covid19 pandemic reduced industry capacity drove a significant increase in our cargo yield and we also generated cargo revenue through the operation of cargoonly charter flights ie using aircraft in our fleet not then being utilized for passenger travel these two factors contributed to the smaller percentage decline in cargo revenue than in passenger revenue compared to the prior year 

the length and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to the covid19 pandemic are uncertain as described in item 1a risk factors but we currently expect three phases in 2021 we anticipate that the early part of the year will be characterized by fluctuating demand with continued distribution of effective vaccines and easing of travel advisories and restrictions we believe customer confidence will grow leading to increased demand in the spring and summer of 2021 we expect vaccination to become widespread during the second half of 2021 resulting in sustained demand improvement

passenger revenue by geographic region 



passenger revenue decreased 294 billion or 70 compared to the prior year prasm decreased 38 and passenger mile yield decreased 1 on 51 lower capacity load factor decreased 32 pts from the prior year to 55 

we began waiving changes fees on most tickets during 2020 and subsequently changed our policy with respect to change fees as described above in taking care of our customers and employees we do not expect these policy changes to materially affect our revenue in future periods 

domestic 

prior to the initial effects of the covid19 pandemic in march 2020 domestic results were strong with revenue nearly 10 higher than the prior year period however due to the decrease in customer demand beginning in march passenger unit revenue related to our domestic region decreased 42 with capacity down 43 compared to the prior year we are planning for improvement to the demand environment primarily from leisure customers to continue in 2021 though still significantly lower than the comparable period in 2019 we remain optimistic about the ultimate recovery of business travel but are unable to predict the timing or extent of that recovery 

international 

passenger revenue related to our international regions decreased 76 compared to the prior year the reductions in revenue and capacity presented in the table above were a result of reduced demand and government travel directives and quarantines limiting or suspending air travel due to the global spread of covid19 additionally many countries have implemented international testing requirements which has slowed demand in the shortterm but is expected to enhance the longterm recovery of international air travel we expect this significantly lower demand environment to continue into 2021 with improvement expected after the recovery in domestic travel as an initial step to this recovery in december 2020 we became the first us airline to offer flights between the us and europe that allow customers to avoid quarantine upon arrival after testing negative for the virus prior to travel and upon arrival in amsterdam and rome during 2020 we transferred our ustokyo services from narita to haneda airport tokyos preferred airport for corporate customers and continued to develop our network connectivity with our joint venture partner korean air at seoulincheon airport in each of the international regions we continue to monitor government travel directives and customer demand and will adjust flight schedules accordingly 

prior to the covid19 pandemic we completed two transactions to further strengthen our international partnerships in the atlantic region effective january 2020 we combined our separate transatlantic joint venture agreements with air franceklm and virgin atlantic into a single threeparty transatlantic joint venture this enhanced joint venture is designed to strengthen collaboration between the three airlines and is expected to provide customers with increased access to destinations across north america the uk and europe 

in the latin america region in january 2020 we completed the tender offer to acquire 20 of the shares of latam as part of our plan to create a strategic alliance additionally in the march 2020 quarter we started codesharing for certain flights operated by latam in may 2020 we signed a transamerican joint venture agreement with latam that subject to regulatory approvals will combine our highly complementary route networks between north and south america with the goal of providing customers with a seamless travel experience and industryleading connectivity we believe this alliance will generate growth opportunities building upon deltas and latams global footprint and joint ventures see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our strategic alliance with latam and the impact of its bankruptcy filing

other revenue 



ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes refinery sales to third parties aircraft maintenance provided to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations refinery sales to third parties which are at or near cost increased 11 billion compared to 2019 the increase in thirdparty refinery sales resulted from the refinerys shift to producing more nonjet fuel products due to the decline in demand for jet fuel the increase in refinery sales was partially offset by an approximately 270 million or approximately 30 decline in revenue from aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties which decreased due to the reduction in flights operated worldwide in addition results for 2019 also included approximately 200 million of revenue from delta private jets which was combined with wheels up in january 2020 and is no longer reflected in ancillary businesses and refinery 

loyalty program loyalty program revenues relate primarily to brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in miles sold including redemption of miles for nontravel awards these revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on american express cards which declined at a lower rate than air travel during the year

operating expense 



as discussed above under expense management in response to the reduced demand and related reduction in revenue following the onset of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 we quickly reduced capacity to more closely align with demand and implemented cost saving initiatives related to our fleet and operations and delayed or eliminated nearly all discretionary spending 

as a result most operating expense line items decreased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019 operating expenses decreased primarily due to the voluntary separation programs and work hour reductions described below the many cost reduction measures and programs implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic and the reduction in volume and sellingrelated costs during 2021 as effective vaccines become broadly available vaccination becomes widespread globally travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow we expect operating expense to increase as capacity and revenue return however we believe that many of the cost savings achieved during 2020 were structural in nature which we expect to lead to lower nonfuel unit cost in the future 

the discussion below is focused largely on the yearoveryear changes in certain operating expense line items that were not primarily driven by the reduction in capacity or revenue these include many of the cost reduction measures and programs we implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic 

salaries and related costs the decrease in salaries and related costs is primarily due to actions taken in response to the decreased demand for air travel due to the covid19 pandemic beginning in march 2020 and continuing through december 2020 we reduced salaries by 100 for our ceo and 50 for our officers in addition we reduced work hours by 25 for all other management and most frontline employee work groups we offered voluntary unpaid leaves of absence for periods ranging from 30 days up to 12 months and approximately 50000 of our employees elected a leave at various times throughout 2020 also during the september 2020 quarter approximately 18000 employees elected to participate in voluntary separation programs reducing our workforce by approximately 20 we expect the lower headcount following these voluntary separation programs to mitigate the impact on salaries and related costs from the restoration of salaries and work hours in 2021 enabling us to maintain lower costs compared to 2019

5 because we combined delta private jets with wheels up in january 2020 we have excluded the impact of delta private jets from 2019 results for comparability 

depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to aircraft that have been retired or impaired during 2020 including the md88 md90 717 737700 767300er and 777 fleet types as well as certain a320 aircraft impairments and other charges related to the retirement of these fleets are reflected in restructuring charges see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these fleet retirements 

ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations increased expenses were primarily related to refinery sales to third parties which are at or near cost these refinery cost of sales increased 11 billion compared to 2019 due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel following the onset of the covid19 pandemic the refinery shifted production to more nonjet fuel products which increased the sales to third parties during 2020 compared to the prior year period the increase in refinery costs was partially offset by a decrease of approximately 260 million in the cost of aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties compared to 2019 due to the reduction in flights operated worldwide in addition approximately 180 million of costs related to services performed by delta private jets in 2019 were recorded in ancillary businesses and refinery prior to the combination of that business with wheels up in january 2020 

aircraft rent most aircraft operating lease expenses are recorded in aircraft rent and are contractually fixed therefore aircraft rent did not decline to the same extent as our other operating expense line items compared to 2019 

restructuring charges restructuring charges are composed of various expenses that resulted from our response to the unprecedented impact on our business from the covid19 pandemic primarily due to fleet impairment and related charges and voluntary separation program charges see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these restructuring charges 

government grant recognition in april 2020 we entered into an agreement with the us department of the treasury to receive emergency support through the cares act payroll support program which totaled 56 billion the support payments included a grant of 40 billion that was fully recognized as a contraexpense in 2020 over the period that the funds were intended to benefit we expect to receive approximately 29 billion in the march 2021 quarter as part of the payroll support program extension of which approximately 20 billion is expected to be in the form of grants that we plan to recognize as contraexpense during the first half of 2021 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about government support programs including the cares act

item 7 mda  refinery segment 

refinery segment 

the refinery operated by our subsidiary monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively monroe primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel monroe has agreements in place to exchange the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations historically the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 200000 barrels per day or approximately 75 of our precovid19 pandemic consumption for use in our airline operations we believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinerys operation generally contributes to reducing the market price of jet fuel and lowers our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would be 

the refinery’s production has also been altered by the dramatic change in economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic during 2020 the refinery operated at 60 – 90 of normal production levels largely due to the significant decrease in the demand for jet fuel additionally due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel the refinery has shifted production to produce more nonjet fuel products those nonjet fuel products will continue to be exchanged for jet fuel to the extent that the refinery can balance refinery sales with jet fuel demand 

the refinery recorded operating revenues of 31 billion in 2020 compared to 56 billion in 2019 as a result of the refinerys shift to producing more nonjet fuel products operating revenues in 2020 were composed of 15 billion of nonjet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel 11 billion of refinery sales to third parties 307 million of nonjet fuel product sales and 214 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment refinery revenues decreased compared to the prior year periods due to lower refinery run rates during the year as well as lower pricing for refined products 

the refinery recorded an operating loss of 216 million in 2020 compared to operating income of 76 million in 2019 the operating loss in 2020 compared to income in 2019 was mainly driven by an increase in rins compliance costs discussed below and the reduction in revenue which was partially offset by cost savings resulting from decreased production levels 

a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market the refinery operated by monroe purchases the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market observable rins prices increased throughout 2020 with monroe incurring 172 million in rins compliance costs during 2020 as compared to 58 million in 2019

item 7 mda  financial condition and liquidity 

financial condition and liquidity 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we took actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position which included the following during 2020 we are continuing to monitor and carefully manage our liquidity 

• completing financing transactions for an aggregate principal amount of approximately 259 billion which are discussed in financing activities below 

• receiving 56 billion as part of the cares act payroll support program as described in government support programs above 

• reducing planned capital expenditures by approximately 28 billion for the year to 19 billion including restructuring our aircraft order books for future aircraft deliveries delaying aircraft modifications and postponing certain information technology initiatives and ground equipment replacement see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our aircraft purchase commitments 

• amending our credit facilities to replace fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with liquiditybased covenants 

• suspending share repurchases and dividends indefinitely and postponing voluntary pension funding 

as of december 31 2020 we had 167 billion in cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities in addition in january 2021 we received 14 billion with respect to the payroll support program extension described below with the remaining 15 billion expected in the march 2021 quarter 

we expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments financing arrangements government assistance under the payroll support program restricted cash equivalents and cash flows from operations we expect to meet our longterm liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements 

we have unencumbered assets available for potential financing arrangements if needed during 2020 we used existing cash and cash received from financings to fund capital expenditures of 19 billion of which the largest portion was incurred before the onset of the covid19 pandemic and to return 604 million to shareholders also before the onset of the global pandemic capital expenditures in 2020 following the onset of the covid19 pandemic were limited to only those critical to our operation 

the following discussion of liquidity evaluates various material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations but does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts discussed herein 

sources and uses of liquidity 

operating activities 

operating activities in 2020 used 38 billion compared to providing 84 billion in 2019 including the 29 billion in payroll support payments we expect to receive during the march 2021 quarter if the demand environment evolves as described above we expect to generate positive cash flows from operations during 2021 as described above we are planning for demand recovery throughout much of 2021 with sustained demand improvement expected during the second half of 2021 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 41 

item 7 mda  financial condition and liquidity 

our operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability has historically increased during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreased during the summer and fall months however the ongoing reduction in demand for air travel due to the covid19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented low level of advance bookings and the associated cash received as well as significant ticket cancellations which led to issuance of cash refunds or travel credits to customers the total value of cash refunds excluding taxes and related fees issued to customers during 2020 was approximately 31 billion travel credits represented approximately 65 of the air traffic liability as of december 31 2020 

the length and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to the covid19 pandemic are uncertain as described in item 1a risk factors but we currently expect three phases in 2021 we anticipate that the early part of the year will be characterized by fluctuating demand with continued distribution of effective vaccines and easing of travel advisories and restrictions we believe customer confidence will grow leading to increased demand in the spring and summer of 2021 we expect vaccination to become widespread during the second half of 2021 resulting in sustained demand improvement 

fuel  fuel expense represented approximately 11 of our total operating expense for 2020 the market price for jet fuel is volatile which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations we expect fuel consumption to be lower through the march 2021 quarter than the comparable quarter in 2020 as only the final weeks of the march 2020 quarter were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic through the remainder of 2021 as effective vaccines become broadly available vaccination becomes widespread globally travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow we expect capacity to return and fuel consumption to increase compared to the comparable period of 2020 though we still expect it to be lower than the comparable period in 2019 

employee benefit obligations we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the pension protection act of 2006 we had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 or 2020 we have no such requirements in 2021 and based on our current projections we do not expect any minimum required contributions until 2025 however during 2019 we voluntarily contributed 1 billion to these plans as a part of our liquidity initiatives we suspended voluntary pension funding that we were previously planning in 2020 we plan to contribute at least 500 million to these plans in 2021 

in addition we have employee benefit obligations relating primarily to projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our employee benefit obligations 

voluntary separation programs in 2020 we recorded a 34 billion charge associated with voluntary early retirement and separation programs and other employee benefit charges approximately 720 million of this charge was disbursed in cash payments to participants during 2020 an additional approximately 250 million of cash payments were disbursed in 2020 related to unused vacation and other benefits which were accrued prior to the voluntary programs charge we anticipate that approximately 600 million in cash payments will be made to participants in the voluntary separation programs in 2021 and the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond 

profit sharing our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees we paid 16 billion in profit sharing in february 2020 related to our 2019 pretax profit in recognition of our employees contributions toward meeting our financial goals we will not have a profit sharing payment in 2021 based on the pretax loss in 2020 

government support programs see financing activities below for discussion of the impact to our liquidity from the government support programs in 2020 and 2021 

contract carrier obligations we have certain estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with thirdparty regional carriers these minimum amounts are based on the required minimum levels of flying by the regional carriers under the respective agreements and assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying as of december 31 2020 the total of these minimum amounts was 77 billion which range from approximately 800 million to 14 billion on an annual basis over the next five years see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our contract carrier obligations

operating lease obligations as described further in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 we had a total of 86 billion of minimum operating lease obligations these minimum lease payments range from approximately 700 million to 900 million on an annual basis over the next five years 

other obligations we have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to aviationrelated maintenance professional security insurance marketing technology sponsorships and other thirdparty services and products as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 80 billion of such obligations which range from approximately 400 million to 900 million on an annual basis over the next five years 

investing activities 

shortterm investments using a portion of the proceeds we obtained through our financing transactions discussed below in 2020 we acquired a net of 58 billion in shortterm investments see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these investments 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft fleet modifications and technology enhancements our capital expenditures were 19 billion in 2020 of which the largest portion was incurred before the onset of the covid19 pandemic and 49 billion in 2019 

in 2020 we restructured our aircraft order books with airbus and mhi rj aviation group manufacturer of crj aircraft in an effort to better match the timing of aircraft deliveries with our network and financial needs over the next several years the restructuring reduced our aircraft purchase commitments by more than 2 billion in 2020 and by more than 5 billion through 2022 the shift in delivery timing is intended to allow us to continue simplifying and modernizing our fleet while maintaining our airbus order book 

we expect that we will have capital expenditures of approximately 25 billion in 2021 primarily for aircraft including deliveries and advance deposit payments as well as aircraft modifications the majority of which relate to cabin improvements and technology enhancements we expect that the capital expenditures in 2021 will be funded through either cash flows from operations or financing arrangements we have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained but are under no obligation to use longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our aircraft purchase commitments 

in connection with a dispute brought at the world trade organization against the eu and certain member states to address state subsidies in the large civil aircraft sector the us trade representative has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from the eu including 15 tariffs on certain new aircraft and certain airplane parts originating in france and germany we are pursuing strategies to minimize the impact if any of these tariffs on our business 

equity investments in january 2020 we acquired 20 of the shares of latam for 19 billion or 16 per share through a tender offer in addition to support the establishment of our strategic alliance we agreed to make transition payments to latam totaling 350 million of which 75 million remains to be paid by the end of 2021 

as part of our planned strategic alliance with latam we have also assumed 10 of latams a350 purchase commitments with airbus for deliveries through 2025 we believe this alliance will generate growth opportunities building upon deltas and latams global footprint and joint ventures 

during 2020 we acquired through open market transactions additional outstanding shares of hanjinkal the largest shareholder of korean air for 158 million as of december 31 2020 our equity ownership interest in hanjinkal was approximately 13

given reduced passenger volumes resulting from the covid19 pandemic we have accelerated the construction schedule for this project additionally in 2020 we enhanced the project’s scope to include a more customerfriendly design of terminal 3 a delta one lounge and expanded delta sky club and baggage system upgrades designed to increase the terminals’ operational efficiency going forward construction is expected to be completed by 2023 

the project is expected to cost approximately 23 billion a substantial majority of the project costs are being funded through the regional airports improvement corporation raic a california public benefit corporation using an 800 million revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders the credit facility was executed during 2017 and amended in 2020 and we have guaranteed the obligations of the raic under the credit facility loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the city’s purchase of completed project assets under the lease agreement and subsequent project component approvals by the citys board of airport commissioners the city has appropriated to date approximately 18 billion to purchase completed project assets representing the maximum allowable reimbursement by the city costs incurred in excess of the 18 billion maximum will not be reimbursed by the city we currently expect our net project costs to be approximately 500 million of which approximately 200 million has been reflected as investing activities in our cash flows statement since the project started in 2017 

in 2020 315 million was spent on this project with 293 million paid by the credit facility and 22 million paid directly by delta approximately 550 million is expected to be spent on the project during 2021 with 445 million to be paid by the credit facility and 105 million to be paid directly by delta 

new yorklaguardia redevelopment as part of the terminal redevelopment project at laguardia airport we are partnering with the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority to replace terminals c and d with a new stateoftheart terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across 4 concourses connected to a central headhouse the terminal will feature a new larger delta sky club wider concourses more gate seating and 75 more concessions space than the existing terminals the facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and dropoffpickup areas the design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026 

in connection with the redevelopment during 2017 we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the port authority with a term through 2050 pursuant to the lease agreement as amended to date we will 1 fund through debt issuance and existing cash and undertake the design management and construction of the terminal and certain offpremises supporting facilities 2 receive a port authority contribution of 481 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure 3 be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and 4 have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to port authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers we currently expect our net project cost to be approximately 35 billion and we bear the risks of project construction including any potential cost overruns using funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements we spent approximately 600 million during 2020 bringing the total amount spent on the project to date to approximately 15 billion we expect to spend approximately 900 million during 2021 of which a substantial majority will be paid using cash restricted for airport construction see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt related to this redevelopment project the new york transportation development corporation nytdc special facilities revenue bonds series 2018 and nytdc special facilities revenue bonds series 2020

critical accounting estimates 

our critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise noted below 

loyalty program 

our skymiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits miles by flying on delta delta connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program when traveling customers earn miles based on the passengers loyalty program status and ticket price customers can also earn miles through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies miles are redeemable by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and other participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards to facilitate transactions with participating companies we sell miles to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines 

the loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations 1 passenger ticket sales earning miles and 2 sale of miles to participating companies 

passenger ticket sales earning miles passenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with 1 miles earned and 2 air transportation which are each considered performance obligations we value each performance obligation on a standalone basis to value the miles earned we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash which is referred to as equivalent ticket value etv our estimate of etv is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed breakage we use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions to the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years we recognize breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed 

at december 31 2020 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 72 billion a hypothetical 10 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of approximately 60 million on annual revenue recognized 

we defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the etv of a mile would decrease annual passenger revenue by approximately 40 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of miles to participating companies customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from three to eleven years during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 total cash sales from marketing agreements were 28 billion and 42 billion respectively which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations as discussed below 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 46 

item 7 mda  critical accounting estimates 

our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express our agreements with american express provide for joint marketing grant certain benefits to deltaamerican express cobranded credit card holders cardholders and american express membership rewards program participants and allow american express to market its services or products using our customer database cardholders earn miles for making purchases using cobranded cards and certain cardholders may also check their first bag for free are granted discounted access to delta sky club lounges and receive priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on delta additionally participants in the american express membership rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program we sell miles at agreedupon rates to american express which are then provided to their customers under the cobrand credit card program and the membership rewards program effective january 1 2019 we amended our cobrand and other agreements with american express which increased the value we receive and extended the terms to 2029 the products and services delivered are consistent with previous agreements 

we account for marketing agreements including those with american express by allocating the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered we allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services which generally consist of award travel priority boarding baggage fee waivers lounge access and the use of our brand we determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 etv for the award travel obligation adjusted for breakage 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta 4 brand value using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand and 5 volume discounts provided to certain partners 

we defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight such as baggage fee waivers is recognized as travelrelated services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed revenue allocated to access delta sky club lounges is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations primarily brand value is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including certain of the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both comparable public company multiples a market approach and projected discounted future cash flows an income approach when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 3 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows including the duration and extent of impact to our business and our alliance partners from the covid19 pandemic 2 current discount rates 3 observable market transactions and 4 anticipated changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot access additional open skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals these assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition when performing a qualitative valuation we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 47 

item 7 mda  critical accounting estimates 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinitelived to definitelived factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies global pandemics or other factors 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot access additional open skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion at december 31 2020 based upon our quantitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in key assumptions above in addition to the change in our market capitalization during the current year we determined that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore there was no indication that goodwill was impaired 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 60 billion at december 31 2020 of which 59 billion related to indefinitelived intangible assets indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements 

in 2020 we performed quantitative assessments of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including applicable factors noted in key assumptions above and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired as the fair value of each asset exceeded its carrying value by at least 10 assumptions are sensitive to uncertainty about future events the macroeconomic environment and other marketbased risk factors a change in key assumptions such as the discount rate or projected future revenues expenses and cash flows could materially affect the determination of fair values however we believe the impact of the pandemic is temporary in nature and does not materially impact the longrange forecasts for our goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles management evaluated estimates and assumptions used in the valuations considering market and industryspecific conditions

property and equipment net 

our flight equipment which consists of aircraft and associated engines and parts and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 265 billion at december 31 2020 this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we review flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired factors which could be indicators of impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for active and temporarily parked aircraft we group assets at the fleet type level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by thirdparty regional carriers ie the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel and labor costs and other relevant factors given the substantial reduction in our active aircraft and diminished projections of future cash flows in the near term as a result of the covid19 pandemic we evaluated our fleet during 2020 and determined that only the fleet types discussed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements were impaired as the future cash flows from the operation of all other fleet types through the respective retirement dates exceeded the carrying value as we obtain greater clarity about the duration and extent of reduced demand and potentially execute further capacity adjustments we will continue to evaluate our fleet compared to network requirements and may decide to retire additional aircraft future decisions regarding the temporarily parked aircraft and the timing of any return to service will be dependent on the evolution of the demand environment

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and our response we have removed certain aircraft from active service as of december 31 2020 which includes owned and leased aircraft that are being retired early this resulted in impairment and other related charges of 44 billion recorded in restructuring charges in our income statement these charges were calculated using level 3 fair value inputs based primarily upon recent market transactions and thirdparty bids which were corroborated with published pricing guides and our assessment of existing market conditions based on industry knowledge the effects of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 created additional estimation uncertainty as there is currently a limited market for aircraft and limited data on how the covid19 pandemic has affected the fair value of aircraft following the impairment charges the remaining aggregate net book value of these aircraft as of december 31 2020 is approximately 500 million see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding these impairments and related charges 

income tax valuation allowance 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets we establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things projected future taxable income scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results and tax planning strategies in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred income tax assets the significant factors that we consider include 1 our recent history of profitability 2 growth in the us and global economies 3 forecast of airline revenue trends 4 estimate of future fuel prices and 5 future impact of taxable temporary differences 

at december 31 2020 our net deferred tax asset balance was 20 billion  including a 460 million valuation allowance primarily related to capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses although we are in a three year cumulative loss position as of december 31 2020  we have a recent history of significant earnings prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic we expect to return to profitability as the effects of the pandemic subside and to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards before any expire our federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before 2018 do not begin to expire until 2027 under current tax law federal net operating losses generated in 2020 do not expire therefore we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses that have short expiration periods 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals as of december 31 2020 the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our balance sheet was 61 billion we had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 or 2020 we have no such requirements in 2021 and based on our current projections we do not expect any minimum required contributions until 2025 however during 2019 we voluntarily contributed 1 billion to these plans as a part of our liquidity initiatives we suspended voluntary pension funding that we were previously planning in 2020 we plan to contribute at least 500 million to these plans in 2021 the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on highquality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 262 and 340 at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 340 to 433 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity fixed income real assets hedge funds and other assets and instruments our weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2020 was 897 

delta air lines inc 2020 form 10k 49 

item 7 mda  critical accounting estimates 

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



life expectancy  changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost we use the society of actuaries soa published mortality data and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy the soa publishes updated mortality tables for us plans and updated improvement scales each year we consider updates by the soa in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations 

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules alternative funding rules for defined benefit plans that are frozen we elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an 885 discount rate until the 17year period expires for all frozen defined benefit plans by the end of 2024 

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants 

investments valued at net asset value nav per share on an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments these investments valued using nav as a practical expedient are typically valued on a monthly or quarterly basis by thirdparty administrators valuation agents or fund managers with an annual audit performed by an independent third party but certain of these investments have a lag in the availability of data this primarily applies to private equity private equityrelated strategies and real assets we solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments

item 7a market risk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative contracts we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

fuel price risk 

changes in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations a one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately 40 million of additional annual fuel expense based on annual precovid19 pandemic consumption of approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel as a result of the reduced capacity from the covid19 pandemic our jet fuel consumption during 2020 of 19 billion gallons was significantly less than our historical and expected future consumption our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s inventory 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2020 we had 223 billion of fixedrate debt and 59 billion of variablerate debt the rates used in our variablerate debt are based on libor or another index rate which in certain cases is subject to a floor an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate debt by 12 billion at december 31 2020 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate debt and variablerate leases by 29 million 

the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the london interbank offered rate libor after 2021 in december 2020 the administrator of libor proposed to cease publication of certain libor settings after december 2021 and to cease publication of the remainder of the libor settings after june 2023 to mitigate the possible impact of this change various regulators have proposed alternative reference rates the effect of any discontinuation or replacement of libor cannot be predicted at this time but we believe our risk would be limited to variablerate debt and variablerate finance leases which utilize rates for which the settings are to be discontinued after june 2023 because we have an immaterial amount of contracts that utilize the settings to be discontinued immediately after december 2021 at december 31 2020 we had approximately 38 billion of variablerate debt and variablerate finance leases maturing after june 2023 all of which include provisions to update the applicable reference rate and we do not expect this rate to be materially different from libor 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts 

at december 31 2020 we had a us dollarsouth korean won cross currency swap contract totaling a 13 million liability position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the south korean won in relation to the us dollar would have changed the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contract by 17 million for the year ending december 31 2020

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities in the domestic market these arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets approximately 15 of our passenger revenue in 2019 was related to flying by regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program delta connection ®  we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our dl designator code we currently have contractual arrangements with 

• compass airlines llc compass and gojet airlines llc gojet both subsidiaries of trans states holdings inc trans states 

• endeavor air inc a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 

• republic airline inc republic a subsidiary of republic airways holdings inc and 

• skywest airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest inc 

we have agreed with each of compass and gojet not to renew our existing arrangements and end our relationship with each by the end of 2020 

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our dl designator code we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least ten years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

skywest airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement this proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

global impact 

as we connect people with communities experiences and each other we are committed to doing our part to build a better world giving back to the communities where we live work and serve is part of our culture and we have pledged to give one percent of our annual net income back to communities across the globe as a purposedriven and valuesled company we are committed to reducing our environmental impact we were among the leaders in the industry to offer comprehensive onboard recycling to our passengers and are working to reduce our use of singleuse plastics the chief focus of reducing our impact on the environment is jet fuel which is the primary contributor to our carbon footprint we continue to focus on increasing fuel efficiency as we replace older aircraft with more fuelefficient jets and improve the efficiency of our existing aircraft through operational efforts 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china cargo airlines czech airlines cargo korean air cargo and saudia cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

related businesses 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations in 2019 the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 12 billion 

• in addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of over 1000 mainline and regional aircraft our mro operation known as delta techops serves aviation and airline customers from around the world 

• our vacation wholesale subsidiary delta vacations provides vacation packages to thirdparty consumers 

• delta private jets until january 2020 a whollyowned subsidiary provides aircraft charters aircraft management and programs allowing members to purchase flight time by the hour in january 2020 we combined delta private jets with wheels up establishing one of the world’s largest owned and managed fleets of private aircraft we now own an equity stake in wheels up 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



1 includes the operations of our regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements 

2 includes the impact of fuel hedge activity and refinery segment results 

monroe energy 

our wholly owned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively monroe operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk these companies are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers we own monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our new york operations 

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining approximately 200000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined petroleum products nonjet fuel products monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers 

strategic agreements monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations 

fuel hedging program 

our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s inventory we may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations however it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel and crude oil weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and loyalty programs the industry has evolved through mergers and new entry both domestically and internationally and evolution in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the presence of subsidized government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with significant financial resources extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines frontier airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition from governmentowned and subsidized carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways is significant these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and have increased service to the us these carriers government subsidies have allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have enhanced competition in international markets 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and qantas 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the faa exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding essential air services which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers the dot engages in regulation of economic matters such as transactions involving allocation of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at airports where such mechanisms are in place the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act with oversight by the national mediation board environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia and jfk in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos haneda airport londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a number of international federal state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions noise reduction water discharges aircraft drinking water storage and use of petroleum and other regulated substances and the management and disposal of hazardous waste substances and materials 

emissions  carbon emissions by the aviation industry and their impact on climate change have become a particular focus in the international community and within the us for several years the european union has required its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its emissions trading scheme ets under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the ets was amended to apply only to flights within the european economic area from 2013 through 2016 in 2017 the eu extended the exemption for foreign flights through 2023 based on the international civil aviation organization’s icao adoption of a global marketbased program 

in 2016 icao formally adopted a global marketbased emissions offset program known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia this program establishes a mediumterm goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 based on a 20192020 baseline a pilot phase of the offset program will begin in 2021 followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027 countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase and the united states has agreed to participate in these voluntary phases participation in the second phase is mandatory for certain countries including the united states we submitted our corsia emissions monitoring plan to the faa in 2019 and are monitoring emissions for the 20192020 baseline period in 2017 icao also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from aircraft the new aircraft certification standards apply to new aircraft types in 2020 and to new inproduction aircraft starting in 2023 but no later than 2028 these standards will not apply to existing inservice aircraft however exemption from the certification requirement could affect how these aircraft are treated under other programs governing co 2 emissions 

in 2016 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final finding under the clean air act that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and further determined that aircraft cause or contribute to greenhouse gases the endangerment finding does not establish standards but triggers an obligation for the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft the epa has historically implemented air emissions control standards adopted by icao however the epa has yet to issue regulations to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft pursuant to the 2016 endangerment finding 

we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions additional regulation could result in taxation regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

we seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our carbon emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement of older aircraft and replacement with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas and other air emissions 

under the energy independence and security act of 2005 and 2007 the renewable fuel standard rfs was created setting up specific targets of renewable fuel to be used in the us economy by mandating the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refiner may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because monroe blends only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases primarily in response to predictions about what the epa andor the us congress will do with respect to compliance obligations 

other environmental matters  we are subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites soil andor ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address these impacts we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the craf program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2020 the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board nmb an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for representation a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day cooling off period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board peb to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the status quo for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in self help self help includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 91000 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 19 of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



we are in discussions with representatives of our pilots and endeavor air flight attendants regarding terms of amendable collective bargaining agreements 

in addition to the domestic airline employee groups discussed above 199 refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2022 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act nlra which generally allows either party to engage in self help upon the expiration of the agreement 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors relating to delta 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners 

an aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient 

in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

as a regular part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including information necessary for our operations personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

our information systems and those of our service providers are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information or those of our service providers including through fraud or other means of deception hardware or software we develop acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security for example we were notified in 2018 that a thirdparty vendor of chat services for delta and other companies determined it had been involved in a cyber incident for a short period in 2017 we have incurred remedial legal and other costs in connection with this incident but the costs are not material to our financial position or results of operations 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time as a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data in addition to continuously risk assessing and reviewing our procedures processes and technologies we also continue to monitor review and update the process and control requirements we expect our third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of delta information that is in their care however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all information security breaches or misuse of data 

the compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to our information or that of our customers employees or business partners or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business the costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material in addition as cybercriminals become more sophisticated the cost of proactive defensive measures may increase 

disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend such as power telecommunications or the internet the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers and other security issues a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our network including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our customer service and result in increased costs while we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans including the creation of a backup data center and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and any material adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

failure of our technology to perform effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as deltacom mobile device applications checkin kiosks customer service applications application of biometric technology airport information displays and related initiatives including security for these initiatives we are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems the performance reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers if our technology does not perform effectively our business and operations would be negatively affected which could be material 

our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers including through joint ventures we expect to continue exploring ways to expand our relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these investments and relationships involve significant challenges and risks including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that they may not generate the expected financial results these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers we do not have control over their operations or business methods to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period or their actions have a significant adverse effect on our operations our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in certain circumstances we also may be subject to consequences of the failure of these carriers to comply with laws and regulations including us laws to which they may be subject for example we may be subject to consequences from improper behavior of our joint venture partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act such a result could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

our primary credit facility has various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio we have other smaller facilities some of which are secured and also contain collateral coverage ratios a decline in the value of our assets supporting these facilities from factors that are not under our control could affect one or more of the ratios in addition the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and where applicable repossess collateral which may include aircraft or other valuable assets in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2019 approximately 19 of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted the collective bargaining agreement with our pilots became amendable on december 31 2019 and we are in discussions with representatives of the pilots regarding terms of the collective bargaining agreement monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the nlra which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters or other environmental events can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in our international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by third parties including thirdparty regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including thirdparty carriers in the delta connection program and ground operations at some airports while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations in particular some thirdparty regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines if this shortage becomes more widespread thirdparty regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us to the extent that a significant disruption in services occurs because third party providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel over the last decade fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile in 2019 our average fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges was 202 an 82 decrease from our average fuel price in 2018 in 2018 our average fuel price per gallon was 220 a 310 increase from our average fuel price in 2017 of 168 fuel costs represented 211 230 and 192 of our operating expense in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

the competitive nature of the airline industry may affect our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers in addition because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase at times in the past we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or taxes changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

if monroes cost of producing nonjet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results if insurance is unable to cover a significant liability in addition such an incident could damage our reputation 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position in addition because of our ownership of monroe the occurrence of an environmental or other incident could result in damage to our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

in particular under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because monroe blends only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases we cannot predict the future prices of rins purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroes products could limit the refinerys production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our operating results could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our reputation and brand could be damaged if we are exposed to significant adverse publicity 

we operate in a highly visible public environment with significant exposure to traditional and social media adverse publicity whether justified or not can rapidly spread including through social or digital media in particular passengers can use social media to provide feedback about their interaction with us in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to adverse publicity our brand and reputation may be damaged significant damage to our overall reputation and brand image could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business despite significant security measures at airports and airlines the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups we constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry in addition the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant security events primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of any of these events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds in addition potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring reputational harm and other costs if any or all of these types of events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and loyalty programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of subsidized government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines frontier airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition from governmentowned and subsidized carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways is significant these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and have increased service to the us these carriers are governmentsubsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory 

increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate or the extended grounding of a type of aircraft or engine we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

similarly the airline industry is heavily dependent on a limited number of aircraft and engine manufacturers whose products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements the longterm grounding of an aircraft or engine type that we operate could have a significant impact on our operations if we are not able to substitute or replace the affected aircraft or engine type and could in any event have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

airport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as an international carrier we are subject to a wide variety of us and foreign laws that affect trade including tariff and trade policies export requirements taxes monetary policies and other restrictions and charges on october 2 2019 an arbitration tribunal of the world trade organization ruled in a longstanding dispute that the united states could impose 75 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to european union subsidies to airbus effective october 18 2019 the us trade representative imposed tariffs on certain products imported from the european union including an ad valorem duty of 10 on commercial aircraft originating in france and germany some of the airbus aircraft that we have on order would be subject to these tariffs if imported as new aircraft we are pursuing strategies to minimize the impact of these tariffs on our aircraft deliveries but if we are unsuccessful or if the tariffs are increased these tariffs could substantially increase the cost to us of the affected aircraft which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition some of our operations are in highrisk legal compliance environments failure to comply with trade sanctions the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable laws or regulations could result in litigation assessment of damages imposition of penalties or other consequences any or all of which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we and other us carriers are subject to us and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies have recently updated privacy regulations applicable to private industry including airlines ongoing compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and any future expansion 

the airline industry is subject to many forms of environmental regulation including increased regulation to reduce emissions failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws governing the protection of the environment compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry in order to address aircraft emissions icao a un specialized agency formally adopted a global marketbased emission offset program known as corsia this program establishes a mediumterm goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 based on a 20192020 baseline certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally 

in addition to corsia we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions additional regulation could result in taxation regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations while the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the us or other countries could impose significant additional costs on our operations 

because of the global nature of our business unfavorable global economic conditions or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally with approximately 30 of our revenues from operations outside of the us our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

economic conditions following the united kingdom’s exit from the european union could have a material adverse effect on our business 

following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the uk approved an exit often referred to as brexit from the european union the uk’s withdrawal became effective on january 31 2020 a transition period will apply until the end of 2020 or later if extended during which the prebrexit legal regime will continue to apply including with respect to aviation while the uk and european union negotiate rules that will apply to their future relationship it is unknown how that future relationship will be structured regardless of what happens between the uk and european union the us  european union open skies air services agreement will continue to apply to air services between the us and the european union and a new usuk open skies agreement will apply to air services between the us and the uk 

currently it is uncertain what will be the terms of the future relationship between the uk and the european union on matters such as trade customs financial services and the movement of goods and people furthermore postbrexit ambiguity or changes in regulations could diminish the value of route authorities slots or other assets owned by us or our joint venture partners and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and financial condition 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness such as a novel coronavirus or fear of such an event can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as a result of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan hubei province china we have temporarily ceased operations in china and the continued spread of the virus could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for air travel and as a result our financial results moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

capacity antitrust litigation 

in july 2015 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed alleging that delta american united and southwest had conspired to restrain capacity the lawsuits were filed in the wake of media reports that the us department of justice had served civil investigative demands upon these carriers seeking documents and information relating to this subject the lawsuits have been consolidated into a single multidistrict litigation proceeding in the us district court for the district of columbia in november 2016 the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the claims and the matter is now proceeding through discovery delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits

year in review 

delta had a strong year in 2019 delivering record financial results and making significant progress on strategic priorities we leveraged our brand momentum to drive strong revenue growth and improvement in pretax income margin earnings per share and free cash flow over 2018 strategic accomplishments during the year include our renewed agreement with american express and announcing plans to enter into a strategic alliance with latam 

our pretax income for 2019 was 62 billion representing a 1 billion or 20 increase compared to the prior year diluted earnings per share of 730 improved 29 over 2018 our 84 billion of cash flows from operations helped fund 49 billion in capital expenditures resulting in free cash flow of 42 billion representing a 18 billion improvement to the prior year we returned 72 of free cash flow or 3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends the improvement in earnings and cash flow primarily resulted from a 26 billion increase in revenue and lower fuel expense on an 8 decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel and improved fuel efficiency 

we continued to run the world’s most reliable airline and set a new record for zero cancel days with 165 cancelfree days across the system and 281 on our mainline operations industryleading operational performance our culture of service and continued product investments supported record customer satisfaction scores in 2019 we increased net promoter scores in every geographic region highlighted by a 5point improvement in the domestic region to 50 

strong brand drives revenue growth 

compared to 2018 our operating revenue increased 26 billion or 58 on balanced growth across our diverse revenue streams with premium product ticket revenue driving nearly half of the improvement and strong growth in both loyalty and mro revenue total revenue per available seat mile trasm and trasm adjusted a nongaap financial measure increased 12 and 28 respectively compared to the prior year led by 1 unit revenue growth in our domestic and latin regions 2 demand strength in both business and leisure segments and 3 strong growth in premium products and nonticket revenues total loyalty revenue grew 18 in 2019 

solid cost performance 

operating expense operating expense increased 12 billion or 31 primarily due to higher revenue and capacityrelated expenses including wages and profit sharing for employees and contracted services expense salaries and related costs were higher due to pay rate increases for eligible employees implemented during 2019 while profit sharing was higher due to increased profitability in 2019 the increase in contracted services expense predominantly relates to services performed by delta global services dgs that were recorded in salaries and related costs prior to the sale of that business in december 2018 these increases were partially offset by lower fuel expense on an 8 decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel and improved fuel efficiency driven by our ongoing fleet transformation 

our operating cost per available seat mile casm decreased 13 to 1467 cents compared to 2018 primarily due to lower fuel expense and a 46 increase in capacity nonfuel unit costs casmex a nongaap financial measure increased 20 to 1052 cents due to the higher revenue and capacityrelated expense increases discussed above 

nonoperating expense total nonoperating expense was 420 million during 2019 compared to 113 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in pension and related expense compared to the prior year partially offset by higher gains on investments 

expanding our global network 

in 2019 international revenues grew 27 on a 33 increase in capacity we continued to make significant progress in expanding our global reach by acquiring an equity stake in hanjinkal the largest shareholder of korean air and announcing plans to enter into a strategic alliance with latam and completing a tender offer to acquire a 20 equity stake which closed in january 2020 effective in january 2020 we combined our separate transatlantic joint venture agreements with air franceklm and virgin atlantic into a single threeparty transatlantic joint venture in addition we continue to make progress on our joint venture agreement with westjet with respect to transborder routes between the us and canada this agreement remains subject to required regulatory approvals 

investing for the future 

our 84 billion of cash flows from operations helped fund 49 billion in capital expenditures for the business as part of our multiyear fleet transformation we took delivery of 88 new aircraft including a321200s b737900ers a350900s a330900s a220100s and crj900s these deliveries allowed for the retirement of older less fuel efficient aircraft including the announced retirement of our md90 fleet by the end of 2022 we also made significant investments in cabin interior refurbishments sky clubs and technology

passenger revenue 

ticket revenues including both main cabin and business cabin and premium products increased 20 billion compared to the year ended december 31 2018 business cabin and premium products ticket revenue includes revenues from fare products other than main cabin including delta one delta premium select first class and comfort the growth in ticket revenue was driven by strength in the delta brand and products capitalizing on healthy industry business and leisure demand we continue to take delivery of new aircraft that include more premium seats while also generating higher paid load factor for premium products 

loyalty travel awards revenue increased 249 million compared to the year ended december 31 2018 due to growth in mileage redemptions travelrelated services increased 315 million compared to the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to increases in checked baggage and ticket change revenues 

passenger revenue by geographic region 



passenger revenue increased 25 billion or 63 compared to the prior year prasm increased 17 and passenger mile yield increased 08 on 46 higher capacity load factor increased 08 pts from the prior year to 863 

domestic unit revenue increased 24 resulting from our commercial initiatives including our premium products as well as high load factors driven by a combination of strong demand and limited industry capacity growth 

passenger revenue related to our international regions increased 27 yearoveryear primarily due to capacity growth in the atlantic region and yield strength in the latin america region this growth in passenger revenue was achieved despite the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations 

atlantic unit revenues decreased due to foreign currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro and british pound the uncertain economic outlook in europe and increased industry capacity these conditions were partially offset by growth in premium product demand and strong us point of sale 

unit revenue increased in latin america principally as a result of yield growth mainly due to reduced industry capacity in brazil and improvements in mexico beach markets in the september 2019 quarter we announced our plan to enter into a strategic alliance with latam which is expected to provide great customer convenience a more seamless travel experience and to better connect customers between north and south america 

unit revenue decreased in the pacific region primarily on persistent economic and trade related uncertainty foreign currency fluctuations and increased capacity to china japan and korea due to our network transformation despite these challenges our joint venture with korean air has enabled solid traffic growth and we have continued to reshape our pacific network with the announcements that in the march 2020 quarter we will transfer our ustokyo services from narita to haneda airport tokyos preferred airport for corporate customers and shift our beijing service to the new beijing daxing airport 

starting in february 2020 we temporarily suspended flights between the us and china as the result of an outbreak of a novel coronavirus originating in wuhan hubei province china we have suspended flights between the us and china through april 30 will continue to monitor the situation closely and may make additional adjustments 

other revenue 



loyalty program loyalty program revenues relate primarily to brand usage by third parties and include the redemption of miles for nontravel awards 

effective january 1 2019 we amended our cobrand agreement with american express and we also amended other agreements with american express during the march quarter the new agreements increase the value we receive and extend the terms to 2029 under the agreements we sell miles to american express and allow american express to market its services or products using our brand and customer database the products and services sold with the miles such as award travel priority boarding baggage fee waivers lounge access and the use of our brand are consistent with previous agreements we continue to use the accounting method that allocates the consideration received based on the relative selling prices of those products and services the increase in loyalty program revenues are primarily related to brand usage by american express 

ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes aircraft maintenance provided to third parties our vacation wholesale operations our private jet operations and refinery sales to third parties refinery sales to third parties which are at or near cost decreased 451 million compared to 2018 the 2018 results also included 244 million of thirdparty revenue from dgs which was sold in december 2018 these decreases were mitigated by growth in our mro revenues which increased 175 million to 877 million during 2019 

in january 2020 we combined delta private jets our wholly owned subsidiary which provides private jet operations with wheels up upon closing we received a 27 equity stake in wheels up delta private jets will no longer be consolidated and annual revenues of approximately 200 million which have historically been generated ratably through the year will no longer be reflected in ancillary businesses and refinery revenue 

miscellaneous miscellaneous revenue is primarily composed of lounge access and codeshare revenues with lounge access revenue driving the majority of the 160 million increase compared to 2018 we continually enhance the customer experience at our lounges which also included opening three new sky clubs during 2019 in austin phoenix and new orleans 

operating expense 



salaries and related costs the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to pay rate increases for eligible employees this increase is partially offset by salaries for dgs employees which are no longer included in salaries and related costs following the sale of that business in december 2018 dgsrelated expenses are now recorded in contracted services 

aircraft fuel and related taxes fuel expense decreased 501 million compared to the prior year despite a 46 increase in capacity due to an 8 decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel and improved fuel efficiency driven by our investment in new aircraft 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted nongaap financial measures

2 market price for jet fuel at airport locations including related taxes and transportation costs 

3 mtm adjustments and settlements on hedges include the effects of the derivative transactions disclosed in note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and the reason for adjusting fuel expense see supplemental information below 

contracted services the increase in contracted services expense predominantly relates to services performed by dgs that were recorded in salaries and related costs prior to the sale of that business in december 2018 during 2018 dgs incurred expenses of approximately 350 million related to internal delta services that were primarily recorded in salaries and related costs after the sale of dgs to a third party we now record these expenses and our portion of the new entitys airco financial results under the equity method of accounting in contracted services 

depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily results from 79 million of accelerated depreciation due to the decision to early retire our md90 fleet by the end of 2022 new aircraft deliveries fleet modifications and technology enhancements as we take delivery of new aircraft we continue to evaluate our current fleet compared to network requirements see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the planned early retirement of our md90 fleet 

in addition to investing in our fleet we have also increased our technology investments in an effort to enhance interactions with our customers and allow us to deliver more personalized service further enhancing the customer experience and strengthening our brand and competitive position during 2019 we delivered several capabilities that enable our frontline employees to personalize their interactions with our customers added selfservice features on the flydelta app including automatic international checkin integrated security wait times and the ability to preselect meals in delta one and domestic first class in addition we expanded facial recognition biometric boarding for international travelers in the atlanta minneapolisst paul and salt lake city airports these increased capital expenditures have led to a corresponding increase in depreciation and amortization 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consist of costs associated with the maintenance of aircraft used in our operations the increase primarily relates to a higher volume of scheduled engine overhauls on certain aircraft during the second half of 2019 

profit sharing profit sharing expense increased 342 million to 16 billion marking the sixth consecutive year that delta employees will receive over 1 billion in recognition of their contributions to the companys performance the increase in profit sharing is related to higher profit during the year our profit sharing program pays 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion 

ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties our vacation wholesale operations our private jet operations and refinery sales to third parties expenses related to refinery sales to third parties which are at or near cost decreased 451 million compared to the prior year in addition approximately 200 million of costs related to services performed by dgs on behalf of third parties were recorded in ancillary businesses and refinery prior to the sale of that business in december 2018 these decreases were partially offset by growth in our mro business as discussed above 

in january 2020 we combined delta private jets our wholly owned subsidiary which provides private jet operations with wheels up upon closing we received a 27 equity stake in wheels up delta private jets will no longer be consolidated and annual costs of approximately 200 million which have historically been incurred ratably through the year will no longer be reflected in ancillary businesses and refinery expense 

nonoperating results 



interest expense at december 31 2018 the principal amount of debt and finance leases was 97 billion during 2019 we issued 15 billion of unsecured notes and 500 million of aircraft secured eetc debt as a result of the debt issuances partially offset by principal payments the amount of debt and finance leases was 110 billion at december 31 2019 despite the increase in debt during the current year interest expense decreased 10 million compared to the prior year due to recent refinancing transactions at lower interest rates resulting from our improvement to investment grade credit rating in recent years and the favorable interest rate environment 

gainloss on investments gainloss on investments reflects the gains and losses on our equity investments the increase compared to 2018 primarily results from unrealized gains in hanjinkal and air franceklm 

miscellaneous miscellaneous net is primarily composed of pension and related expense our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investments in virgin atlantic and grupo aeroméxico charitable contributions and foreign exchange gainslosses 

the change from 2019 compared to 2018 primarily results from the unfavorable movement in pension and related expense and the sale of our dgs entity in 2018 the pension and related expense was 65 million in 2019 compared to a benefit of 245 million in 2018 in 2018 the sale of our dgs entity to a subsidiary of argenbright holdings llc resulted in a gain of 91 million 

our equity investment earnings and foreign exchange gainslosses fluctuate and thus impact the comparability of miscellaneous from period to period 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2019 was 231 we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 23 and 24 for 2020 at december 31 2019 we had approximately 19 billion of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards which do not begin to expire until 2027 we believe we will utilize the majority of our remaining federal net operating losses and tax credits during 2020 

for more information about our income taxes see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

refinery segment 

the refinery primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provides approximately 200000 barrels per day or approximately 75 of our consumption for use in our airline operations we believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinerys operation contributes to reducing the market price of jet fuel and thus lowers our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would be 

during the december 2018 quarter the refinery completed a planned maintenance event turnaround and did not produce any refined products for approximately 60 days the turnaround was in accordance with the longterm maintenance plan for the facility to allow for the safe completion of major repairs and upgrades 

the refinery recorded operating revenues of 56 billion in 2019 compared to 55 billion in 2018 operating revenues in 2019 were primarily composed of 40 billion of nonjet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel 11 billion of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment and 395 million of nonjet fuel product sales refinery revenues increased compared to the prior year due to higher throughput and yields offset by lower costs of crude oil leading to lower pricing for associated refined products 

the refinery recorded operating income of 76 million and 58 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively the refinerys operating income in 2019 was higher primarily due to the 60 day cessation of operations during the turnaround in the december 2018 quarter and favorable market conditions year over year 

a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market the refinery operated by monroe purchases the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market observable rins prices stabilized in 2019 after significant fluctuations in previous years with monroe incurring 58 million in rins compliance costs during the current year 

for more information regarding the refinerys results see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months with cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents restricted cash equivalents and financing arrangements as of december 31 2019 we had 60 billion in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 29 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 31 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities during 2019 we used existing cash and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures of 49 billion and return 30 billion to shareholders 

sources of liquidity 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated cash flows from operations of 84 billion in 2019 and 70 billion in 2018 we also expect to continue generating cash flows from operations in 2020 

our operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months 

fuel  fuel expense represented approximately 21 of our total operating expenses for 2019 the market price for jet fuel is volatile which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the pension protection act of 2006 we had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 however during 2019 we voluntarily contributed 1 billion to these plans we contributed 500 million to these plans during 2018 we have no minimum funding requirements in 2020 but we plan to voluntarily contribute approximately 500 million to these plans 

profit sharing our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items 

we pay profit sharing annually in february we paid 13 billion in 2019 and 11 billion in 2018 to our employees in recognition of their contributions toward meeting our financial goals during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded 16 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2019 pretax profit which we will pay to employees in february 2020 

effective october 1 2017 we aligned our profit sharing plans under a single formula under this formula our profit sharing program pays 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion prior to that time the profit sharing program for pilots used this formula but in the first nine months of 2017 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees paid 10 of annual profit and if we exceeded our prioryear results the program paid 20 of the yearoveryear increase in profit to eligible employees 

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures were 49 billion in 2019 and 52 billion in 2018 our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft fleet modifications and technology enhancements 

as part of a multiyear initiative we are investing in aircraft intended to provide more premium products improved customer experience greater fuel efficiency and better operating economics we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained but are under no obligation to use longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of a significant number of these aircraft we expect that we will invest approximately 45 billion in 2020 primarily for aircraft including deliveries and advance deposit payments as well as aircraft modifications the majority of which relate to cabin enhancements throughout our fleet we expect that the investments in 2020 will be funded principally through cash flows from operations 

in october 2019 the office of the us trade representative announced a 10 tariff on new aircraft imported from europe we are evaluating the impact of this announcement on our future airbus deliveries 

equity investments during 2019 we acquired 10 of the outstanding shares of hanjinkal the largest shareholder of korean air for 170 million 

in september 2019 we announced our plan to enter into a strategic alliance with latam airlines group sa latam as well as acquire up to a 20 interest through a tender offer in january 2020 we acquired 20 of the shares of latam for 19 billion or 16 per share 

in addition to support the establishment of the strategic alliance we will invest 350 million 200 million of which was disbursed in 2019 an additional 50 million is scheduled to be disbursed during 2020 as part of our planned strategic alliance with latam we have also agreed to acquire four a350 aircraft from latam and plan to assume ten of latams a350 purchase commitments from airbus with deliveries through 2025 

this alliance is expected to generate new growth opportunities building upon deltas and latams global footprint and joint ventures including deltas existing partnership with aeroméxico we have sold our gol ownership stake and are winding down our commercial agreements with gol to facilitate the formation of our strategic alliance with latam 

see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our equity investments 

los angeles international airport lax construction we executed a modified lease agreement during 2016 with the city of los angeles the city which owns and operates lax and announced plans to modernize upgrade and connect terminals 2 and 3 at lax under the lease agreement we have relocated certain airlines and other tenants from terminals 2 and 3 to terminals 5 and 6 and undertaken various initial projects to enable operations from terminals 2 and 3 during the project we are now designing and constructing the redevelopment of terminal 3 and enhancement of terminal 2 which also includes rebuilding the ticketing and arrival halls and security checkpoint construction of core infrastructure to support the citys planned airport people mover ramp improvements and construction of a secure connector to the north side of the tom bradley international terminal construction is expected to be completed by 2024 

under the lease agreement and subsequent project component approvals by the citys board of airport commissioners the city has appropriated to date approximately 16 billion to purchase completed project assets the lease allows for a maximum reimbursement by the city of 18 billion costs we incur in excess of such maximum will not be reimbursed by the city 

a substantial majority of the project costs are being funded through the regional airports improvement corporation raic a california public benefit corporation using an 800 million revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders the credit facility was executed during 2017 and amended in 2019 and we have guaranteed the obligations of the raic under the credit facility loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the city’s purchase of completed project assets using funding provided by cash flows from operations andor the credit facility we spent approximately 176 million on this project during 2019 and expect to spend approximately 240 million during 2020 

new yorklaguardia redevelopment as part of the terminal redevelopment project at laguardia airport we are partnering with the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority to replace terminals c and d with a new stateoftheart terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across 4 concourses connected to a central headhouse the terminal will feature a new larger delta sky club wider concourses more gate seating and 30 percent more concessions space than the existing terminals the facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and dropoffpickup areas the design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026 

in connection with the redevelopment during 2017 we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the port authority with a term through 2050 pursuant to the lease agreement we will 1 fund through debt issuance and existing cash and undertake the design management and construction of the terminal and certain offpremises supporting facilities 2 receive a port authority contribution of 600 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure 3 be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and 4 have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to port authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers we currently expect our net project cost to be approximately 33 billion and we bear the risks of project construction including any potential cost overruns using funding provided by cash flows from operations andor financing arrangements we spent approximately 562 million on this project during 2019 and expect to spend approximately 700 million during 2020 

in the december 2019 quarter we opened concourse g the first of the four new concourses housing seven of the 37 new gates not only does this deliver the first direct impact to the delta passenger experience it also represents the first major phasing milestone this new concourse will allow us to vacate portions of the existing terminals which can then be demolished and made ready for the next phase of construction the next major milestone will be the opening of the headhouse and concourse e which is scheduled for 2022 

financing activities 

debt and finance leases in february 2019 we entered into a 1 billion term loan issued by two lenders which was subsequently repaid by the end of the june 2019 quarter we used the net proceeds of the term loan to accelerate planned 2019 repurchases under our share repurchase program 

in the march 2019 quarter we completed a 500 million offering of pass through certificates series 20191 20191 eetc through a pass through trust the net proceeds of the offering were used for general corporate purposes including to refinance debt maturing during 2019 

in october 2019 we issued 15 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes consisting of 900 million of 29 notes due 2024 and 600 million of 375 notes due 2029 collectively the notes we used the net proceeds from the offering of these notes to fund a portion of the tender offer to acquire common shares of latam in january 2020 

during 2019 the three major credit rating agencies reaffirmed our investmentgrade ratings 



capital returns to shareholders since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013 we have annually increased the dividend per share and paid 38 billion in total dividends including 980 million in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases we have returned 153 billion to shareholders since 2013 while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 25 compared to the beginning of 2013 during 2019 we repurchased and retired 38 million shares at a cost of 20 billion 

on february 6 2020 the board of directors approved and we will pay a quarterly dividend of 04025 per share to shareholders of record as of february 20 2020 

undrawn lines of credit 

we have 31 billion available in revolving lines of credit these credit facilities include covenants customary for financing of this type if we are not in compliance with these covenants we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them 

covenants 

we were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at december 31 2019

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2019 that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments representing obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

loyalty program 

our skymiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits miles by flying on delta delta connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program when traveling customers earn redeemable miles based on the passengers loyalty program status and ticket price customers can also earn miles through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies to facilitate transactions with participating companies we sell miles to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines miles are redeemable by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and other participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

to reflect the miles earned the loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations 1 miles earned with travel and 2 miles sold to participating companies 

passenger ticket sales earning miles passenger ticket sales earning miles under our loyalty program provide customers with 1 miles earned and 2 air transportation which are considered performance obligations we value each performance obligation on a standalone basis to value the miles earned we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash which is referred to as equivalent ticket value etv our estimate of etv is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed breakage we use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the actual redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years we recognize breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed 

at december 31 2019 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 67 billion a hypothetical 10 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of approximately 200 million on annual revenue recognized 

we defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the etv of a mile would decrease annual passenger revenue by approximately 100 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of miles customers may earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and ridesharing companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations payments are typically due monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period and the terms of our marketing contracts are from one to eleven years during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 total cash sales from marketing agreements were 42 billion and 35 billion respectively which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations as discussed below 

our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express our agreements with american express provide for joint marketing grant certain benefits to deltaamerican express cobranded credit card holders cardholders and american express membership rewards program participants and allow american express to market its services or products using our customer database cardholders earn miles for making purchases using cobranded cards and certain cardholders may also check their first bag for free are granted discounted access to delta sky club lounges and receive priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on delta additionally participants in the american express membership rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program we sell miles at agreedupon rates to american express which are then provided to their customers under the cobrand credit card program and the membership rewards program 

we account for marketing agreements including those with american express by allocating the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered we allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services which generally consist of award travel priority boarding baggage fee waivers lounge access and the use of our brand we determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 etv for the award travel obligation adjusted for breakage 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta 4 brand value using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand and 5 volume discounts provided to certain partners 

effective january 1 2019 we amended our cobrand agreement with american express and we also amended other agreements with american express during the current year the new agreements increase the value we receive and extend the terms to 2029 the products and services delivered are consistent with previous agreements and we continue to allocate the consideration received based on the relative selling prices of those products and services 

we defer the amount for award travel obligation as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are used for travel revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight such as baggage fee waivers is recognized as travelrelated services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed revenue allocated to access delta sky club lounges is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations primarily brand value is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including certain of the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both comparable public company multiples a market approach and projected discounted future cash flows an income approach when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 3 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows 2 terminal period revenue growth and cash flows 3 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 4 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 5 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition when performing a qualitative valuation we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinitelived to definitelived factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot access or additional open skies agreements 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets 

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion at december 31 2019 based upon our quantitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above we determined that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore there was no indication that goodwill was impaired 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 52 billion at december 31 2019 of which 51 billion related to indefinitelived intangible assets indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements 

in 2019 we performed quantitative assessments of our indefinitelived intangible assets including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired as the fair value of each asset exceeded its carrying value by at least 15 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment which consists of aircraft and associated engines and parts and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 313 billion at december 31 2019 this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we review flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired factors which could be indicators of impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by regional carriers ie the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an asset group is impaired the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

as part of our ongoing fleet transformation during 2019 we committed to accelerating the retirement of our md90 fleet this fleet will now be retired by the end of 2022 which is approximately two years earlier than previously planned we evaluated the md90 fleet and determined that the fleet was not impaired as the future cash flows from operation of the fleet through the updated retirement date significantly exceeded the carrying value however the decision to retire the fleet by 2022 including the permanent retirement of 35 aircraft during 2019 resulted in accelerated depreciation of 79 million during 2019 which is recorded in depreciation and amortization in our income statement 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals as of december 31 2019 the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our balance sheet was 54 billion we had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 however during 2019 we voluntarily contributed 1 billion to these plans we have no minimum funding requirements in 2020 but we plan to voluntarily contribute approximately 500 million to these plans the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on highquality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 340 and 433 at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 369 to 433 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity fixed income real assets hedge funds and other assets and instruments our weighted average expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2019 was 897 

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



life expectancy  changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost we use the society of actuaries soa published mortality data and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy the soa publishes updated mortality tables for us plans and updated improvement scales each year we consider updates by the soa in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations 

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules alternative funding rules for defined benefit plans that are frozen we elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an 885 discount rate until the 17year period expires for all frozen defined benefit plans by the end of 2024 

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

investments valued at net asset value nav per share on an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments certain of our investments valued using nav as a practical expedient have a lag in the availability of data this primarily applies to private equity private equityrelated strategies and real assets we solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments

supplemental information 

we sometimes use information nongaap financial measures that is derived from the consolidated financial statements but that is not presented in accordance with gaap under the us securities and exchange commission rules nongaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding 

trasm adjusted 

the following table shows a reconciliation of trasm a gaap measure to trasm adjusted a nongaap financial measure we adjust trasm for the following items to determine trasm adjusted for the reasons described below 

• thirdparty refinery sales we adjust trasm for refinery sales to third parties because these revenues are not related to our airline segment trasm adjusted therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of revenue from our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry 

• dgs sale adjustment because we sold dgs in december 2018 we have excluded the impact of dgs from 2018 results for comparability 



casmex 

the following table shows a reconciliation of casm a gaap measure to casmex a nongaap financial measure we adjust casm for the following items to determine casmex for the reasons described below 

• aircraft fuel and related taxes the volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of yearoveryear financial performance the adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to understand and analyze our nonfuel costs and yearoveryear financial performance 

• ancillary businesses and refinery we adjust for expenses related to aircraft maintenance we provide to third parties our vacation wholesale operations our private jet operations as well as refinery cost of sales to third parties 2018 results also include staffing services performed by dgs because these businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile we adjust for the costs related to these areas to provide a more meaningful comparison of the costs of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry 

• profit sharing we adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry 



free cash flow 

we present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the companys ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives adjustments include 

• net redemptions of shortterm investments net redemptions of shortterm investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period including gains and losses we adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the companys free cash flow generated by our operations 

• strategic investments cash flows related to our investment in hanjinkal the largest shareholder of korean air are included in our gaap investing activities we adjust free cash flow for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the companys free cash flow that is core to our operational performance 

• net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our gaap operating activities and capital expenditures we have adjusted for these items which were primarily funded by cash restricted for airport construction to provide investors a better understanding of the companys free cash flow and capital expenditures that are core to our operational performance in the periods shown

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

fuel price risk 

changes in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations a one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately 40 million of additional annual fuel expense our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s inventory 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2019 we had 76 billion of fixedrate debt and 29 billion of variablerate debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate debt by 300 million at december 31 2019 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate debt by 29 million 

the uk financial conduct authority announced in july 2017 that it intends to no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the london interbank offered rate libor after 2021 to mitigate the possible impact various regulators have proposed alternative reference rates the effect of any discontinuation or replacement of libor cannot be predicted at this time but we believe our risk would be limited to variable rate debt and variable rate finance leases which utilize this rate at december 31 2019 we have approximately 21 billion of variable rate finance leases and variable rate debt maturing after 2021 that include provisions to update the applicable reference rate which are not expected to be materially different from libor 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts 

at december 31 2019 we had open a us dollareuro cross currency swap contract totaling a 9 million asset position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the euro in relation to the us dollar would have changed the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contract by 45 million for the year ending december 31 2019 at december 31 2019 we had open a us dollarsouth korean won cross currency swap contract totaling a 3 million liability position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the south korean won in relation to the us dollar would have changed the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contract by 16 million for the year ending december 31 2019

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

monroe energy 

our wholly owned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively monroe operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk these companies are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers we own monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our new york operations 

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining approximately 200000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined petroleum products nonjet fuel products monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers 

strategic agreements monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations 

fuel hedging program 

our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s refining margins we may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations however it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel and crude oil weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china cargo airlines china southern cargo czech airlines cargo and korean air cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

ancillary businesses 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations in 2018  the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 1 billion 

   

 

 

in december 2018 we sold dal global services llc “dgs” which provides aviationrelated ground support equipment maintenance and professional security services to a new subsidiary of argenbright holdings llc we received a noncontrolling 49 equity stake in the new company and 40 million cash the new company will continue to service our customers and third parties and is expected to continue operating at the same airport locations it currently serves 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and loyalty programs the industry has evolved through mergers and new entry both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the rise of subsidized government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with significant financial resources more extensive global networks and more competitive cost structures 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition from governmentowned and subsidized carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways is significant these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and have increased service to the us these carriers government subsidies have allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have enhanced competition in international markets 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the faa exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding essential air services which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as transactions involving allocation of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act with oversight by the national mediation board environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia and jfk in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a number of international federal state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions noise reduction water discharges aircraft drinking water storage and use of petroleum and other regulated substances and the management and disposal of hazardous waste substances and materials 

emissions  carbon emissions by the aviation industry and their impact on climate change have become a particular focus in the international community and within the us for several years the european union has required its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its emissions trading scheme ets under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the ets was amended to apply only to flights within the european economic area from 2013 through 2016 in 2017 the eu extended the exemption for foreign flights through 2023 based on the international civil aviation organization’s icao adoption of a global marketbased program 

in 2016 icao formally adopted a global marketbased emissions offset program known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia this program is designed toward a mediumterm goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2020 a pilot phase of the offset program will begin in 2021 followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027 countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase but participation in the second phase is mandatory we plan to submit our corsia emissions monitoring plan to the faa in 2019 and begin emissions monitoring for the 2019 baseline year in 2017 icao also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from aircraft the new aircraft certification standards will apply to new aircraft types in 2020 and to new inproduction aircraft starting in 2023 but no later than 2028 these standards will not apply to existing inservice aircraft however exemption from the certification requirement could affect how these aircraft are treated under other programs governing co 2 emissions 

in 2016 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final finding under the clean air act that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and further determined that aircraft cause or contribute to greenhouse gases the endangerment finding does not establish standards but triggers an obligation for the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft the epa has historically implemented air emissions control standards adopted by icao therefore the icao aircraft engine certification standards are expected to influence the development of any future epa greenhouse gas emission standards for aircraft 

we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions additional regulation could result in taxation regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

we seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our carbon emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement of older aircraft and replacement with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas and other air emissions 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted renewable fuel standards rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refiner may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because monroe blends only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases 

other environmental matters  we are subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites soil andor ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address these impacts we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the craf program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2020 the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the nmb an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day cooling off period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board peb to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the status quo for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in self help self help includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 89000 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 19 of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



 

in addition to the domestic airline employee groups discussed above 196 refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2019 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act nlra  which generally allows either party to engage in self help upon the expiration of the agreement 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel over the last decade fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile in 2018  our average fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges was 220  a 310 increase from our average fuel price in 2017  in 2017  our average fuel price per gallon was 168  a 128 increase from our average fuel price in 2016  in 2016  our average fuel price per gallon was 149  a 216 decrease from our average fuel price in 2015 fuel costs represented 230  192 and 183 of our operating expense in 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively 

our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry in addition because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase at times in the past we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

if monroes cost of producing nonjet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel the effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and marktomarket adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results 

to the extent that we may reduce the financial impact of changes in the price of jet fuel through a hedging program we may utilize different contract and commodity types in the program and test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets any hedging program may not be successful in providing price protection due to market conditions and the choice of hedging instruments we closely monitor any hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates in addition we record marktomarket adjustments mtm adjustments on our fuel hedges mtm adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods losses from rebalancing or mtm adjustments or both may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our fuel hedge contracts may contain margin funding requirements which require us to post margin to counterparties or cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers we expect to continue exploring ways to expand our relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these investments and relationships involve significant challenges and risks including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

in addition we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers we do not have control over their operations or business methods to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations or adversely affect our operations our results of operations may be adversely affected we also may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners 

an aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient 

in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

as a regular part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

our information systems and those of our service providers are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information or those of our service providers including through fraud or other means of deception hardware or software we develop acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security we were notified in 2018 that a thirdparty vendor of chat services for delta and other companies determined it had been involved in a cyber incident for a short period in 2017 we have incurred remedial legal and other costs in connection with this incident but the costs are not material to our financial position or results of operations 

the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time as a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data in addition to continuously risk assessing and reviewing our procedures processes and technologies we also continue to monitor review and update the process and control requirements we expect our third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of delta information that is in their care however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data 

the compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business the costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material in addition as cybercriminals become more sophisticated the cost of proactive defensive measures may increase 

disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend such as power telecommunications or the internet for example we experienced a power outage at our data center in 2016 that disrupted our operations even though it was quickly addressed the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers and other security issues a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our network including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our customer service and result in increased costs while we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans including the creation of a backup data center since 2016 and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

failure of our technology to perform effectively could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as deltacom mobile device applications checkin kiosks customer service applications application of biometric technology airport information displays and related initiatives including security for these initiatives we are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems the performance reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers if our technology does not perform effectively our business and operations would be negatively affected which could be material 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

our primary credit facility has various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and a minimum asset coverage ratio we have other smaller facilities some of which are secured and also contain collateral coverage ratios a decline in the value of our assets supporting these facilities from factors that are not under our control could affect one or more of the ratios in addition the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2018  approximately 19 of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the nlra which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters or other environmental events can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in our international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by third parties including thirdparty regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including thirdparty carriers in the delta connection program and ground operations at some airports while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations in particular some thirdparty regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines if this shortage becomes more widespread thirdparty regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us to the extent that a significant disruption in services occurs because third party providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

in particular under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because monroe blends only a small amount of renewable fuels it must purchase the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases we cannot predict the future prices of rins purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroes products could limit the refinerys production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our reputation and brand could be damaged if we are exposed to significant adverse publicity through social media 

we operate in a highly visible public environment with significant exposure to social media adverse publicity whether justified or not can rapidly spread through social or digital media in particular passengers can use social media to provide feedback about their interaction with us in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to adverse publicity our brand and reputation may be damaged significant damage to our overall reputation and brand image could have a negative impact on our financial results 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business despite significant security measures at airports and airlines the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups we constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry in addition the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant security events primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of any of these events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds in addition potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring reputational harm and other costs if any or all of these types of events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and loyalty programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of subsidized government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and other discount or ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition from governmentowned and subsidized carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways is significant these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and have increased service to the us these carriers are governmentsubsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory 

increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

airport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry while the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict new environmental laws or regulations adopted in the us or other countries could impose significant additional costs on our operations either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs that our suppliers pass along to us 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies have recently updated privacy regulations applicable to private industry including airlines ongoing compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

because of the global nature of our business unfavorable global economic conditions or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally with approximately 30 of our revenues from operations outside of the us our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

economic conditions following the united kingdom’s exit from the european union could adversely affect our business 

following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the uk approved an exit from the european union often referred to as brexit the uk’s withdrawal is scheduled to become effective march 29 2019 but there is substantial uncertainty regarding the terms of the withdrawal regardless of what happens with brexit the useu open skies air services agreement will remain in effect and the recently signed usuk open skies agreement will take effect maintaining the current liberal air services regime in the transatlantic market the imposition of restrictions on flying rights between the eu and uk in connection with brexit could negatively impact virgin atlantic our joint venture partner in which we have 49 ownership and could impact the planned integration of our transatlantic joint ventures 

the exit of the uk from the eu without agreement on matters such as trade customs financial services and the movement of goods and people between the eu and the uk could adversely impact the demand for air travel in the uk and increase costs for us and our joint venture partners furthermore postbrexit ambiguity or changes in regulations could diminish the value of route authorities slots or other assets owned by us or our joint venture partners and therefore could adversely impact on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness or fear of such an event can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

capacity antitrust litigation 

in july 2015 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed alleging that delta american united and southwest had conspired to restrain capacity the lawsuits were filed in the wake of media reports that the us department of justice had served civil investigative demands upon these carriers seeking documents and information relating to this subject the lawsuits have been consolidated into a single multidistrict litigation proceeding in the us district court for the district of columbia in november 2016 the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the claims and the matter is now proceeding through discovery delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

year in review 

our pretax income for 2018 was 52 billion  representing a 349 million decrease compared to the prior year primarily resulting from higher fuel expense and salaries and related costs offset by increased operating revenue pretax income adjusted a nongaap financial measure was 51 billion  a decrease of 137 million compared to the prior year the adjustments to pretax income were primarily related to 53 million of fuel hedge marktomarket mtm adjustments and settlements in the current year compared to 259 million in the prior year 

delta had a solid year in 2018 as the company maintained focus on its longterm strategy while also addressing the shortterm challenges from higher fuel prices our culture and solid foundation enabled the company to successfully offset the majority of the 23 billion increase in fuel during 2018 our strategic priorities for the year were 1 leveraging our strong brand to drive revenue growth 2 improving our cost performance 3 continuing to build our global franchise and 4 investing for the future 

strong brand drives revenue growth 

compared to 2017  our operating revenue increased 33 billion  or 80  with strong demand for our premium products and growth in revenues from nonticket sources total revenue per available seat mile trasm and trasm adjusted a nongaap financial measure increased 43 compared to the prior year led by 1 unit revenue growth in each of our four geographic regions 2 broadbased strength in both leisure and corporate demand and 3 doubledigit growth in premium products and nonticket revenues 

improving our cost performance 

operating expense operating expense increased 40 billion  or 114  primarily due to 23 billion higher fuel expense and higher wages and profit sharing for employees the increase in fuel expense primarily resulted from a 31 increase in the market price per gallon of fuel and our 36 capacity growth compared to 2017 which was partially offset by improved fuel efficiency driven by our investment in new aircraft salaries and profit sharing were higher due to pay rate increases for eligible employees implemented during 2017 and 2018 along with an adjustment to our profit sharing plan in 2018 

our operating cost per available seat mile casm increased 75 to 1487 cents compared to 2017 primarily due to higher fuel expense and salaries and related costs nonfuel unit costs casmex a nongaap financial measure increased 14 to 1031 cents due to the pay rate increases discussed above 

nonoperating expense total nonoperating expense was 113 million during 2018 compared to 466 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the pension benefit compared to the prior year gains from investmentrelated transactions and lower interest expense 

expanding our global network 

in 2018 international revenues grew 67 on a 09 increase in capacity we made significant progress in expanding our global reach implementing a transpacific joint venture with korean air lines entering into a joint venture agreement with westjet with respect to transborder routes between the us and canada and reaching an agreement with air franceklm and virgin atlantic to combine our separate transatlantic joint ventures into a single threeparty transatlantic joint venture the westjet and threeparty transatlantic joint venture agreements remain subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals 

investing for the future 

our 70 billion cash flows from operations funded 52 billion in capital expenditures for the business as part of our multiyear refleeting initiative we took delivery of 68 new aircraft including a321200s b737900ers a350900s a220100s and crj900s these deliveries allowed for the retirement of older less efficient aircraft 

the nongaap financial measures pretax income adjusted trasm adjusted and casmex used above are defined and reconciled in supplemental information below 

results of operations  2018 compared to 2017 

operating revenue 



 

passenger revenue 

ticket and loyalty travel awards revenue 

ticket including both main cabin and business cabin and premium products and loyalty travel awards revenue increased 25 billion and 248 million  respectively compared to the year ended december 31 2017  consistent with the discussion of passenger revenue by geographic region below business cabin and premium products ticket revenue includes revenues from fare products other than main cabin including delta one delta premium select first class and comfort the growth in this ticket revenue primarily results from an increased number of premium seats driven by new aircraft deliveries the continued expansion of our branded fare products and strength in business demand 

passenger revenue by geographic region 



passenger revenue increased 28 billion  or 76  compared to the prior year prasm increased 39 and passenger mile yield increased 40 on 36 higher capacity load factor was slightly lower than the prior year period at 855  

unit revenues of the domestic region increased 26  resulting from our commercial initiatives including branded fares strong demand and fare increases implemented throughout 2018 in response to higher fuel prices our domestic operations have generated yearoveryear unit revenue and business yield growth throughout 2018 during the september 2018 quarter we signed a definitive agreement with westjet that after regulatory approval will create a uscanada transborder joint venture providing enhanced offerings and more choice for customers 

passenger revenue related to our international regions increased 67 yearoveryear including growth in all three regions despite reduced capacity in the pacific and latin america during 2018 we continued to expand our branded fare products and leveraged the relationships with our alliance partners to generate unit revenue increases across all three international regions 

in the atlantic unit revenues increased due to yearoveryear yield strength from business cabin traffic and the benefit provided by foreign currency fluctuations yield growth was particularly strong as we continued to leverage our alliance partners hub positions in europes leading business markets of amsterdam london and paris during 2018 we initiated service on our flagship a350900 with delta one suites and the delta premium select cabin from detroit to amsterdam we also launched several new routes including los angeles to paris and amsterdam indianapolis to paris and atlanta to lisbon 

unit revenues increased in latin america principally as a result of yield growth particularly in the caribbean which has generated seven consecutive quarters of unit revenue growth key destinations impacted by the 2017 hurricane damage continue to recover the increase was partially offset by the impact of political and economic uncertainty and foreign currency fluctuations in mexico brazil and central america the negative impact of travel advisories and political uncertainty in mexico has diminished toward the end of the year we benefited from our joint cooperation agreement with aeroméxico which marked its first anniversary during 2018 over that time we have combined with aeroméxico to launch nine new routes between the united states and mexico providing our customers with improved connectivity more convenient schedules and seamless service between the two carriers 

unit revenues increased in the pacific region due to yield strength particularly in japan and korea and a benefit provided by foreign currency fluctuations in may 2018 we launched a joint venture with korean air which provides more opportunities for our customers to reach destinations throughout asia during 2018 we also introduced our flagship a350900 on routes from los angeles to shanghai detroit to beijing and shanghai and atlanta to seoulincheon which has improved the customer experience and added premium seats to the market resulting in unit revenue increases 

other revenue 



ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes aircraft maintenance and staffing services provided to third parties our vacation wholesale operations our private jet operations and refinery sales to third parties the increase compared to 2017 primarily resulted from growth in our aircraft maintenance business of 19 on higher engine overhaul volume 

in december 2018 we sold dal global services llc “dgs” which provides aviationrelated ground support equipment maintenance and professional security services to a new subsidiary of argenbright holdings llc we received a noncontrolling 49 equity stake in the new company and 40 million cash the new company will continue to service our customers and third parties and is expected to continue operating at the same airport locations it currently serves in 2019 dgs will no longer be reflected within ancillary businesses and refinery dgs generated 244 million and 214 million in thirdparty revenues during 2018 and 2017 respectively 

loyalty program loyalty program revenues relate to brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in mileage credits sold including redemption of mileage credits for nontravel awards loyalty program revenues increased compared to 2017 related to growth in our cobrand credit card relationship with american express through both additional card acquisitions and increased spend 

miscellaneous miscellaneous revenue is primarily composed of lounge access and codeshare revenues 

operating expense 



salaries and related costs the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to pay rate increases for eligible employees implemented during 2017 and 2018 

aircraft fuel and related taxes fuel expense increased 23 billion compared to the prior year due to a 31 increase in the market price per gallon of fuel and a 36 capacity growth which was partially offset by improved fuel efficiency driven by our investment in new aircraft 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted nongaap financial measures 



 

regional carriers expense excluding fuel the decrease in regional carriers expense compared to the prior year results from the 75 million reduction in rent expense following the impairment of the endeavor crj200 fleet effective january 1 2018 for additional information on this impairment see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily results from our increased capital expenditures in recent years these investments have allowed for additional new aircraft deliveries including a321200s b737900ers a350900s a220100s and crj900s fleet modifications and technology enhancements as we take delivery of new aircraft we continue to evaluate our current fleet compared to network requirements 

in addition to investing in our fleet we have also increased our technology investments in an effort to enhance interactions with our customers and allow us to deliver more personalized service further enhancing the customer experience and strengthening our brand and competitive position during 2018 we delivered several capabilities that enable our frontline employees to personalize their interactions with our customers added selfservice features on both the mobile app and deltacom and launched the first facial recognition biometric terminal for international travelers at the atlanta airport 

ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties our vacation wholesale operations our private jet operations and refinery sales to third parties expenses related to refinery sales to third parties which are at or near cost increased 46 million compared to the prior year primarily resulting from higher sales volume the remainder of the increase in ancillary businesses and refinery primarily resulted from growth in our aircraft maintenance business 

in december 2018 we sold our staffing services business dgs to a subsidiary of argenbright holdings llc therefore in 2019 this business will no longer be reflected within ancillary businesses and refinery during 2018 and 2017 dgs incurred expenses of approximately 200 million per year related to services performed for third parties 

in addition during 2018 and 2017 dgs incurred expenses of approximately 350 million related to internal delta services that were primarily recorded in salaries and related costs after the sale of dgs to a third party delta will record these expenses and our portion of the new entitys financial results under the equity method of accounting in contracted services 

profit sharing profit sharing expense increased 236 million to 13 billion  marking the fifth consecutive year that delta employees will receive over 1 billion in recognition of their contributions to the companys performance the increase in profit sharing is related to the alignment of our profit sharing programs under a single formula which was implemented october 1 2017 under this formula our profit sharing program pays 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit as defined by the terms of the program and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion prior to october 1 2017 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees paid 10 of annual profit and if we exceeded our prioryear results the program paid 20 of the yearoveryear increase in profit to eligible employees

passenger revenue by geographic region 



passenger revenue increased 11 billion over the prior year prasm increased 22 and passenger mile yield increased 10 on 10 higher capacity load factor was 1 point higher than the prior year at 856  

unit revenues of the domestic region increased 16  resulting from our commercial initiatives including branded fares and an improving revenue environment we continued to differentiate our product offerings and enable customer choice through segmentation including offering basic economy throughout our domestic network our domestic operations closed 2017 with three consecutive quarters of yearoveryear unit revenue growth with robust demand for both business and leisure we saw improvements in business markets with 81 of the top 100 business markets producing positive yields during the december 2017 quarter up from 50 earlier in the year 

passenger revenues related to our international regions increased 05 yearoveryear primarily due to strength in the atlantic and latin america regions partially offset by revenue declines in the pacific during 2017 we continued to expand our branded fare products offered throughout the international regions 

the atlantic region closed 2017 with three consecutive quarters of yearoveryear unit revenue growth on strong business class bookings we continued to leverage our alliance partners hub positions in europes leading business markets of amsterdam london and paris to increase the volume of us pointofsale traffic the uk was particularly robust with unit revenue growth throughout 2017 including doubledigit growth in the second half of 2017 during the year we expanded our basic economy product to mitigate the impact of ultralow cost carrier capacity increases 

unit revenues increased in latin america principally resulting from unit revenue improvement in brazil related to both improved traffic and higher fares this improvement was driven by the strengthening of the brazilian economy and additional connectivity for our customers provided by our relationship with gol increased leisure traffic to mexico and the caribbean and the incremental value provided by our alliance with aeroméxico also contributed to the latin america unit revenue improvement although unit revenue improved in the caribbean hurricane damage in several markets during 2017 resulted in temporary service adjustments finally we continued to differentiate our product offerings including expanding basic economy and selling comfort as a separate fare product in latin america 

unit revenue declines in the pacific primarily resulted from industry capacity growth in the region we continued to optimize the pacific region with a 77 reduction in capacity during 2017 focused on refining the network to generate incremental value from our chinese and korean alliances and differentiating our product offerings including expanding basic economy and selling comfort as a separate fare product during 2017 we reached an agreement to create a transpacific joint venture with korean air offering an enhanced and expanded network industryleading products and service and a seamless customer experience between the us and asia we also retired our last b747400 and introduced our new a350900 with delta one suites and the delta premium select cabin on routes from detroit to tokyonarita and seoulincheon resulting in improvements in both profitability and customer feedback these efforts began to show results as the pacific returned to positive prasm growth during the december 2017 quarter for the first time in more than four years 

other revenue 



ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes aircraft maintenance and staffing services provided to third parties our vacation wholesale operations our private jet operations and refinery sales to third parties the increase in ancillary businesses and refinery primarily resulted from 268 million of additional refinery sales to third parties 

loyalty program loyalty program revenues relate to brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in mileage credits sold including redemption of mileage credits for nontravel awards loyalty program revenues increased compared to 2016 related to growth in our cobrand credit card relationship with american express 

miscellaneous miscellaneous revenue is primarily composed of lounge access and codeshare revenues 

operating expense 



salaries and related costs the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to pay rate increases for eligible employees 

aircraft fuel and related taxes fuel expense increased 771 million compared to the prior year due to a 22 increase in the market price per gallon of fuel partially offset by reduced fuel hedge losses compared to the prior year and profits generated within our refinery segment 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted nongaap financial measures 



 

depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation expense primarily results from new aircraft deliveries including b737900er a321200 a330300 and a350900 aircraft fleet modifications and accelerated depreciation due to the planned retirement of our md88 fleet and two b767300er aircraft 

contracted services the increase in contracted services expense predominantly relates to additional contract labor expenses associated with investments in our technology infrastructure and other activities to improve the customer experience 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consist of costs associated with the maintenance of aircraft used in our operations the increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense primarily relates to an increase in maintenance activity in order to enhance service reliability of certain aircraft 

ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties our vacation wholesale operations our private jet operations and refinery sales to third parties expenses related to refinery sales to third parties which are at or near cost increased 268 million compared to the prior year primarily resulting from higher sales volume 

passenger service passenger service expense includes the costs of onboard food and beverage cleaning and supplies the increase in passenger service expense predominantly relates to costs associated with enhancements to our onboard product offering and higher traffic 

aircraft rent the increase in aircraft rent primarily results from new leased aircraft deliveries since 2016 including b737900er and a321200 aircraft 

nonoperating results 



interest expense at december 31 2017 the principal amount of debt and finance leases was 89 billion  during 2018 we issued 16 billion of unsecured notes 14 billion of nytdc special facilities revenue bonds and 621 million of aircraft secured loans as a result of the debt issuances partially offset by principal payments the amount of debt and finance leases was 97 billion at december 31 2018  despite the increase in debt during the current year interest expense decreased 85 million compared to the prior year due to recent refinancing transactions at lower interest rates resulting from our improvement to an investment grade credit rating in recent years and the favorable interest rate environment 

unrealized gainloss on investments unrealized gainloss on investments reflects the unrealized gains and losses on our equity investments in gol china eastern air franceklm and alclear holdings llc the parent company of clear before we adopted the new financial instruments accounting standard in 2018 we recorded unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss aoci 

miscellaneous during 2018 miscellaneous nonoperating income is composed of pension benefits and realized gains from the dgs transaction and clear share sale this income was partially offset by our proportionate share of losses from our equity investments in virgin atlantic and grupo aeroméxico charitable contributions and foreign exchange losses the favorable movement in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily results from 

 

the favorable movement resulting from pension benefit in 2017 compared to net cost in 2016 primarily resulted from our 35 billion pension contribution during 2017 

our equity investment earnings and foreign exchange gainslosses vary and impact the comparability of miscellaneous from period to period 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2018 was 236  we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 23 and 24 for 2019 at december 31 2018  we had approximately 22 billion of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards which do not begin to expire until 2027  we believe we will utilize the majority of our remaining federal net operating losses and tax credits during 2019 

for more information about our income taxes see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

refinery segment 

the refinery primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provides approximately 200000 barrels per day for use in our airline operations we believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinerys operation has contributed to reduced market price of jet fuel and thus lowered our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would have been 

during the december 2018 quarter the refinery completed a planned maintenance event turnaround and did not produce any refined products for approximately 60 days the turnaround was in accordance with the longterm maintenance plan for the facility to allow for the safe completion of major repairs and upgrades 

the refinery recorded operating revenues of 55 billion in 2018  compared to 50 billion in 2017  operating revenues in 2018 were primarily composed of 36 billion of nonjet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel 962 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment and 900 million of nonjet fuel product sales refinery revenues increased compared to the prior year due to higher costs of crude oil leading to higher pricing for associated refined products and higher margins on distillate product 

the refinery recorded income of 58 million and 110 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively the refinerys income in 2018 was lower primarily due to the turnaround in the december 2018 quarter and lower gasoline margins nationwide 

a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market the refinery operated by monroe purchases the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market during 2018 observable rins prices declined approximately 60 which minimized our compliance costs during the current year 

for more information regarding the refinerys results see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents restricted cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2018  we had 48 billion in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 18 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 30 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities during 2018  we used existing cash and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures of 52 billion  and return 25 billion to shareholders 

sources of liquidity 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated positive cash flows from operations of 70 billion in 2018  50 billion in 2017 and 72 billion in 2016  we had lower operating cash flows during 2017 primarily due to incremental pension plan contributions as discussed below we also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2019  

our operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months 

fuel  fuel expense represented approximately 23 of our total operating expenses for 2018  the market price for jet fuel is volatile which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the pension protection act of 2006 we had no minimum funding requirements in 2018 however during the first three months of 2018 we voluntarily contributed approximately 500 million to these plans in the first half of 2017 we contributed 35 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans using net proceeds from a 20 billion debt issuance shares of our common stock from treasury with a value of 350 million and existing cash we contributed 13 billion in 2016 we have no minimum funding requirements in 2019 but we plan to voluntarily contribute approximately 500 million to these plans 

profit sharing our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items 

we pay profit sharing annually in february we paid 11 billion in 2018 11 billion in 2017 and 15 billion in 2016 to our employees in recognition of their contributions toward meeting our financial goals during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded 13 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2018 pretax profit which we paid to employees in february 2019 

effective october 1 2017 we aligned our profit sharing plans under a single formula under this formula our profit sharing program pays 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion prior to that time the profit sharing program for pilots used this formula but for 2016 and the first nine months of 2017 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees paid 10 of annual profit and if we exceeded our prioryear results the program paid 20 of the yearoveryear increase in profit to eligible employees 

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures were 52 billion in 2018  39 billion in 2017 and 34 billion in 2016  our capital expenditures during 2018 were primarily related to the purchase of aircraft including a321200 b737900er a350900 a220100 and crj900 aircraft advanced deposit payments on future aircraft order commitments and modifications to our domestic fleet our capital expenditures during 2017 and 2016 were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and modifications to upgrade aircraft interiors that enhance our product offering 

as part of a multiyear initiative we are investing in aircraft intended to provide more premium products improved customer experience and better operating economics we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained but are under no obligation to use longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of a significant number of these aircraft we expect that we will invest approximately 47 billion in 2019 primarily for 1 aircraft including deliveries of a321200s b737900ers a220100s a330900neos a350900s and crj900s along with advance deposit payments for these and our new a321200neos and a220300s as well as 2 aircraft modifications primarily related to cabin enhancements to improve the customer experience we expect that the 2019 investments will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations 

equity investments during 2017 we completed a 622 million tender offer and settled derivative contracts for 173 million to obtain additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico during 2017 we also acquired shares of air franceklm for 450 million see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our equity investments 

los angeles international airport lax construction during 2016 we executed a modified lease agreement with los angeles world airports lawa which owns and operates lax and announced plans to modernize upgrade and connect terminals 2 and 3 at lax by 2023 based on the lease agreement we are designing and managing the construction of the initial investment of 350 million to renovate gate areas support space and other amenities for passengers to upgrade the baggage handling systems in the terminals and to facilitate the relocation of those airlines located in terminals 2 and 3 to terminals 5 and 6 and tom bradley international terminal tbit the relocation was completed during 2017 we are also designing and managing the construction of an expansion of the project which is expected to cost an additional 15 billion  of which 13 billion has been approved by lawa the expanded project will include 1 redevelopment of terminal 3 and enhancement of terminal 2 2 rebuilding the ticketing and arrival halls and security checkpoint 3 construction of infrastructure for the planned airport people mover 4 ramp improvements and 5 construction of a secure connector to the north side of tbit 

a substantial majority of the project costs will be funded through the regional airports improvement corporation raic a california public benefit corporation using an 800 million revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders the credit facility was executed during 2017 and we have guaranteed the obligations of the raic under the credit facility loans made under the credit facility will be repaid with the proceeds from lawa’s purchase of completed project assets using funding provided by cash flows from operations andor the credit facility we spent approximately 208 million on this project during 2018 and expect to spend approximately 240 million during 2019 

new yorklaguardia redevelopment as part of the terminal redevelopment project at laguardia airport we are partnering with the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority to replace terminals c and d with a new stateoftheart terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across 4 concourses connected to a central headhouse the terminal will feature a new larger delta sky club wider concourses more gate seating and 30 percent more concessions space than the existing terminals the facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and dropoffpickup areas the design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026 

in connection with the redevelopment during 2017 we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the port authority with a term through 2050 pursuant to the lease agreement we will 1 fund through debt issuance and existing cash and undertake the design management and construction of the terminal and certain offpremises supporting facilities 2 receive a port authority contribution of 600 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure 3 be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and 4 have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to port authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers we currently expect our net project cost to be approximately 33 billion with delta bearing the risks of project construction including any potential cost overruns using funding provided by cash flows from operations andor financing arrangements we spent approximately 304 million on this project during 2018 and expect to spend approximately 530 million during 2019 

financing activities 

debt and finance leases during 2018 we issued 16 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes consisting of 600 million of 34 notes due 2021 500 million of 38 notes due 2023 and 500 million of 4375 notes due 2028 collectively the notes we used the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to repay borrowings outstanding under our secured pacific term loan b1 facility and 2015 term loan facility and for general corporate purposes 

concurrent with the unsecured debt offering we entered into a 265 billion unsecured revolving credit facility up to 500 million of which may be used for the issuance of letters of credit the “revolving credit facility” the revolving credit facility was undrawn at the time we entered into it and as of december 31 2018  the revolving credit facility replaced the undrawn secured pacific revolving credit facility and the 2015 revolving credit facility both of which were terminated in conjunction with the repayment of the term loans described above 

the revolving credit facility is split evenly into a 1325 billion threeyear facility and a 1325 billion fiveyear facility borrowings on both facilities bear interest at a variable rate equal to libor or another index rate in each case plus a specified margin 

also during 2018 the new york transportation development corporation nytdc issued special facilities revenue bonds series 2018 the 2018 bonds in the aggregate principal amount of 14 billion we entered into loan agreements with the nytdc to use the proceeds from the 2018 bonds to finance a portion of the construction costs for the new terminal facilities at the laguardia airport the proceeds from the 2018 bonds are recorded in cash restricted for airport construction on the consolidated balance sheet balance sheet 

during the december 2018 quarter we obtained 621 million in aggregate principal amount of loans secured by 10 aircraft these loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to london interbank offered rates libor plus a specified margin and are due in installments from 2019 to 2023 

despite the recent debt issuances since december 31 2009 we have reduced our principal amount of debt and finance leases by 83 billion  this level of debt reduction combined with more favorable interest rates on our remaining debt reduced our 2018 net interest expense by more than 500 million compared to 2009 the principal amount of debt and finance leases was 97 billion at december 31 2018  

during 2018 the three major credit rating agencies reaffirmed our investmentgrade ratings 



capital returns to shareholders since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013 we have annually increased the dividend per share and paid 29 billion in total dividends including 909 million in 2018 through dividends and share repurchases we have returned 123 billion to shareholders since 2013 while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 21 compared to the beginning of 2013 during 2018 alone we repurchased and retired 29 million shares at a cost of 16 billion  

on february 7 2019 the board of directors approved and we will pay a quarterly dividend of 035 per share to shareholders of record as of march 1 2019 

fuel hedge restructuring during 2016 we entered into transactions to defer settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2017 these deferral transactions excluding market movements from the date of inception provided approximately 300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2016 and required approximately 300 million in cash payments in 2017 

during 2016 we early terminated certain of our outstanding deferral transactions and made cash payments of 170 million including normal settlements as a result during the year ended december 31 2017 we reported 20 million in cash receipts and 244 million in cash payments associated with these transactions during the year ended december 31 2018 we reported 19 million in cash payments associated with these transactions 

undrawn lines of credit 

we have 30 billion available in revolving lines of credit during february 2019 we drew 750 million from our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes 

these credit facilities include covenants customary for financing of this type if we are not in compliance with these covenants we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them 

covenants 

we were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at december 31 2018  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018 that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments representing obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 



  

 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt 

longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using libor at december 31 2018  

finance and operating lease obligations refer to note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding finance and operating leases 

aircraft purchase commitments refer to the aircraft purchase commitments table in item 2 for additional information about our future aircraft purchases 

contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with thirdparty regional carriers the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying 

employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our defined benefit pension plan obligations see critical accounting policies and estimates 

other obligations represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to aviationrelated maintenance professional security insurance marketing technology sponsorships and other thirdparty services and products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

loyalty program 

our skymiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta delta connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program when traveling customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on the passengers loyalty program status and travel fare paid customers can also earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies to facilitate transactions with participating companies we sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines mileage credits are redeemable by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and other participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

to reflect the mileage credits earned the loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations 1 mileage credit earned with travel and 2 mileage credit sold to participating companies 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our loyalty program provide customers with 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation we value each performance obligation on a standalone basis to value the mileage credits earned we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash which is referred to as equivalent ticket value etv our estimate of etv is adjusted for mileage credits that are not likely to be redeemed breakage management uses statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years we recognize breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are actually redeemed 

at december 31 2018  the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 66 billion  a hypothetical 10 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an approximately 200 million impact on annual revenue recognized 

we defer revenue for the mileage credits when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the etv of a mileage credit would decrease annual passenger revenue by approximately 100 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of mileage credits customers may earn mileage credits based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations payments are typically due monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period and the terms of our marketing contracts are generally from one to eight years during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  total cash sales from marketing agreements were 35 billion and 32 billion  respectively which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations as discussed below 

our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express our agreements with american express provide for joint marketing grant certain benefits to deltaamerican express cobranded credit card holders cardholders and american express membership rewards program participants and allow american express to market using our customer database cardholders earn mileage credits for making purchases using cobranded cards may check their first bag for free are granted discounted access to delta sky club lounges and receive other benefits while traveling on delta additionally participants in the american express membership rewards program may exchange their points for mileage credits under the loyalty program we sell mileage credits at agreedupon rates to american express which are then provided to their customers under the cobrand credit card program and the membership rewards program 

we account for marketing agreements including american express consistent with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered we allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services which generally consist of award travel baggage fee waivers lounge access and the use of our brand we determined our best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analyses using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 etv for the award travel obligation 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta and 4 brand value 

we defer the amount for award travel obligation as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight such as baggage fee waivers is recognized as travelrelated services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed revenue allocated to access delta sky club lounges is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations primarily brand value is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue over time as miles are delivered 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both market capitalization and projected discounted future cash flows an income approach when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 3 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows 2 terminal period revenue growth and cash flows 3 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 4 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 5 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinitelived to definitelived factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot access or additional open skies agreements 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets 

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances the stabilized operating environment for us airlines has also contributed to improved financial results 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion at december 31 2018  based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 48 billion at december 31 2018  of which 47 billion related to indefinitelived intangible assets indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements 

we performed qualitative assessments of our indefinitelived intangible assets including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors which impact the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 283 billion at december 31 2018  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we review flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired factors which could be indicators of impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by regional carriers ie the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an asset group is impaired the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset groups carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to our impairment of the endeavor crj200 fleet 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals as of december 31 2018  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our balance sheet was 64 billion  we had no minimum funding requirements in 2018 however during the first three months of 2018 we voluntarily contributed approximately 500 million to these plans we have no minimum funding requirements in 2019 but we plan to voluntarily contribute approximately 500 million to these plans the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on highquality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 433 and 369 at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 457 to 369 between 2016 and 2018 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity fixed income real assets hedge funds and other assets and instruments our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2018 was 897  

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



life expectancy  changes in life expectancy may significantly change our benefit obligations and future expense we use the society of actuaries soa published mortality data other publicly available information and our own perspective of future longevity to develop our best estimate of life expectancy the soa publishes updated mortality tables for us plans and updated improvement scales each year we consider updates by the soa in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations 

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules alternative funding rules for defined benefit plans that are frozen we elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an 885 discount rate 

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

investments valued at net asset value nav per share on an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments certain of our investments valued using nav as a practical expedient have a lag in the availability of data this primarily applies to private equity private equityrelated strategies and real assets we solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

fuel price risk 

changes in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations a one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately 40 million of additional annual fuel expense our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to monroe’s refining margins 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2018  we had 57 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 37 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 240 million at december 31 2018 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 37 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2018  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a 1 million asset position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 6 million gain or 7 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2019

international alliances 

our international alliance relationships with foreign carriers are an important part of our business as they improve our access to international markets and enable us to market globally integrated air transportation services the most significant of these arrangements are commercial joint ventures that include joint sales and marketing coordination colocation of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements our alliance arrangements also include reciprocal codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access arrangements these alliance relationships also may present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements aircraft maintenance insourcing and joint procurement

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets approximately 16 of our passenger revenue in 2017 was related to flying by these regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program delta connection we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our dl designator code we have contractual arrangements with 

 

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our dl designator code we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

skywest airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement this proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

general 

we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

monroe energy 

our wholly owned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively monroe operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk these companies are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers we own monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our new york operations 

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining approximately 200000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined products nonjet fuel products monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers 

strategic agreements monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations 

segments  because the products and services of monroes refinery operations are discrete from our airline services segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment financial information on our segment reporting can be found in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel hedging program 

we have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of fuel as fuel prices are subject to potential volatility we may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates in addition we enter into derivatives with third parties to hedge financial risk related to monroe’s refining margins 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations however it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel and crude oil weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china cargo airlines china southern cargo czech airlines cargo and korean air cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

ancillary businesses 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul mro staffing and other services vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations in 2017  the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 1 billion 

   

 

 

 

distribution and expanded product offerings 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including 1 digital channels such as deltacom and mobile applicationsweb 2 telephone reservations 3 online travel agencies and 4 traditional brick and mortar and other agencies we make fare and product information widely available across those channels ensuring customers always receive the best information and service options an increasing number of our tickets are sold through delta digital direct channels driving more direct personalized interactions with our customers and reducing distribution costs 

  

we have transformed distribution to a more retail oriented merchandised approach by introducing welldefined and differentiated products for our customers we offer distinct travel experiences with clear value propositions that enable customer choice delta one tm  delta premium select first class and delta comfort tm include varying premium amenities and services while main cabin and basic economy allow varying levels of pretravel flexibility as well as exceptional service once onboard the aircraft we expect that these merchandising initiatives as implemented across all of deltas distribution channels will allow customers to better understand our product offerings make it easier to buy the products they desire and increase customer satisfaction this merchandising effort is most effective in deltas digital channels where customers can compare all product options in a single easy to understand display 

technology transformation 

significant progress was made in 2017 in the transformation of our information technology function to improve operational reliability and enhance disaster recovery capabilities most significantly we opened a new data center to provide redundancy for our key systems and continue the enhancement of that facility we also reduced the risk of technology system failures to our operations through additional disaster recovery processes and heightened emphasis on our information security program including through the hiring of an experienced information security professional as our chief information security officer 

we are engaged in a digital transformation by continuing to invest in technology that supports our operations and provides tools for our employees with our long term goal to convert our technology into a competitive advantage these investments include improvements to infrastructure and technology architecture to unify and improve access to data sources and continue innovations in customer facing applications this digital transformation will enhance interactions with our customers and allow us to deliver more personalized service further enhancing the customer experience and strengthening our brand and competitive position 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs the industry has evolved through mergers and new entry both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and more competitive cost structures 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is increasing from governmentowned and funded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us these carriers are governmentsubsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have enhanced competition in international markets 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines

the dot and the federal aviation administration the faa exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding essential air services which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia and jfk in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a number of international federal state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions noise reduction water discharges aircraft drinking water storage and use of petroleum and other regulated substances and the management and disposal of hazardous waste substances and materials 

emissions  greenhouse gas emissions by the aviation industry and their impact on climate change have become a particular focus in the international community and within the us for several years the european union has required its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its emissions trading scheme ets under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the ets was amended to apply only to flights within the european economic area from 2013 through 2016 in 2017 the eu extended the exemption for foreign flights through 2023 given the international civil aviation organization’s icao adoption of a global marketbased program 

in october 2016 icao formally adopted a global marketbased emissions offset program known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation this program is designed to achieve a mediumterm goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2020 a pilot phase of the offset program will begin in 2021 followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027 countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase but participation in the second phase is mandatory in 2016 icao also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from aircraft the new aircraft certification standards will apply to new aircraft types in 2020 and to new inproduction aircraft starting in 2023 but no later than 2028 it is important to note that the standards will not apply to existing inservice aircraft however exemption from the certification requirement would provide no protection from taxation schemes based on co 2 emissions 

in july 2016 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final finding under the clean air act that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and further determined that aircraft cause or contribute to greenhouse gases the endangerment finding does not establish standards but triggers an obligation for the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft the epa has historically implemented air emissions control standards adopted by icao therefore the icao aircraft engine certification standards are expected to influence the development of any epa greenhouse gas emission standards for aircraft 

we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions additional regulation could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

we seek to minimize the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our greenhouse gas emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement of older less fuel efficient aircraft and replacement with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted renewable fuel standards rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa 

other environmental matters  we are subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites soil andor ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address these impacts we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the craf program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2018 the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the nmb an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day cooling off period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board peb to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the status quo for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in self help self help includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 87000 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 19 of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



in addition 192 refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2019 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act nlra  which generally allows either party to engage in self help upon the expiration of the agreement 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel over the last decade fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile during the last several years in 2017  our average fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges was 168  a 128 increase from our average fuel price in 2016  in 2016  our average fuel price per gallon was 149  a 216 decrease from our average fuel price in 2015  in 2015  our average fuel price per gallon was 190  a 452 decrease from our average fuel price in 2014 fuel costs represented 192  183 and 230 of our operating expense in 2017  2016 and 2015  respectively 

our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase at times in the past we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel the effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and marktomarket adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results 

we have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of fuel as fuel prices are subject to potential volatility we may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates our hedging program may not be successful in providing price protection due to market conditions and the choice of hedging instruments in addition we record marktomarket adjustments mtm adjustments on our fuel hedges mtm adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods losses from rebalancing or mtm adjustments or both may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our fuel hedge contracts may contain margin funding requirements which require us to post margin to counterparties or cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

if monroes cost of producing nonjet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers we expect to continue exploring ways to expand our relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these investments and relationships involve significant challenges and risks including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

in addition we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers we do not have control over their operations or business methods to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our results of operations may be adversely affected we also may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners 

an aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient 

in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

as a regular part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information including through fraud or other means of deception hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time as a result of these types of risks and regular attacks we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data the compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business 

disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend such as power telecommunications or the internet the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers and other security issues a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our network including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our customer service and result in increased costs while we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

failure of our technology to perform effectively could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as deltacom mobile device applications checkin kiosks customer service applications airport information displays and related initiatives including security for these initiatives we are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems the performance reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers if our technology does not perform effectively our business and operations would be negatively affected which could be material 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures these changes could result from factors that are not under our control a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where it may be difficult to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2017  approximately 19 of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the nlra which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters or other environmental events can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by third parties including thirdparty regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including thirdparty carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations in particular some thirdparty regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines if this shortage becomes more widespread thirdparty regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us to the extent that a significant disruption in services occurs because third party providers including regional carriers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

in particular under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases we cannot predict the future prices of rins purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroes products could limit the refinerys production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our reputation and brand could be damaged if we are exposed to significant adverse publicity through social media 

we operate in a highly visible public environment with significant exposure to social media adverse publicity whether justified or not can rapidly spread through social or digital media in particular passengers can use social media to provide feedback about their interaction with us in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated to the extent we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to adverse publicity our brand and reputation may be damaged significant damage to our overall reputation and brand image could have a negative impact on our financial results 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of such events could have a significant adverse effect on our business despite significant security measures at airports and airlines the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups we constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry in addition the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant security events primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of such events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds in addition potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring reputational harm and other costs if any or all of these types of events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market as a result we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is significant from governmentowned and funded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and southeast asia are governmentsubsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory 

increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operation 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast us have included concepts such as congestionbased landing fees slot auctions or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry while the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict new environmental laws or regulations adopted in the us or other countries could impose significant additional costs on our operations either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs that our suppliers pass along to us 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies are reviewing airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally with approximately 30 of our revenues from operations outside of the us our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

economic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the united kingdom’s exit from the european union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the uk approved an exit from the european union eu the 

uk government has initiated a process to leave the eu often referred to as brexit and begun negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the airline industry faces substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the exit of the uk from the eu adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation of the airline industry or bilateral agreements governing air travel could have a negative impact on our operations financial condition and results of operations 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness or fear of such an event can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial highlights  2017 compared to 2016 

our pretax income for 2017 was 57 billion  representing a 935 million decrease compared to the prior year primarily due to higher fuel costs salaries and related costs and depreciation expense which were partially offset by increased operating revenue pretax income adjusted for special items a nongaap financial measure was 55 billion  a decrease of 621 million  or 102  special items were primarily related to fuel hedge mtm adjustments and settlements of 259 million in 2017 compared to 450 million in 2016 

revenue compared to 2016 our operating revenue increased 16 billion  or 40  on 10 higher capacity combined with robust demand and strong revenue momentum closing 2017 with three consecutive quarters of yearoveryear passenger unit revenue growth passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm increased 21 led by 1 strong domestic leisure yields 2 expanded distribution of branded fares 3 an improving business fare environment 4 strength in the atlantic region leveraged through us pointofsale traffic gains along with business cabin traffic and yield growth and 5 strong performance in the caribbean central america brazil and mexico leisure markets other revenue increased 97 partially resulting from growth in our cobrand credit card partnership with american express 

operating expense total operating expense increased 24 billion and our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile casm increased 64 compared to 2016 to 1381 cents  primarily due to higher fuel costs salaries and related costs and depreciation expense including our regional carriers fuel expense increased 771 million compared to the prior year due to a 223 increase in the market price per gallon of fuel partially offset by reduced fuel hedge losses compared to the prior year and profits generated within our refinery segment salaries and related costs were higher due to increases for eligible merit ground and flight attendant employees implemented in the june 2017 quarter the increase in depreciation expense primarily results from new aircraft deliveries including b737900er a321200 a330300 and a350900 aircraft fleet modifications and accelerated depreciation due to the planned retirement of our md88 fleet and two b767300er aircraft 

nonfuel unit costs casmex including profit sharing a nongaap financial measure increased 43 to 1057 cents due to the pay rate increases and depreciation expense discussed above which were partially offset by productivity gains from our fleet technology and supply chain initiatives 

the nongaap financial measures for pretax income adjusted for special items and casmex including profit sharing both used above are defined and reconciled in supplemental information below 

results of operations  2017 compared to 2016 

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue increased 10 billion over the prior year prasm increased 21 and passenger mile yield increased 09 on 10 higher capacity load factor was 10 point higher than the prior year at 856  

unit revenues of the domestic region increased 17  resulting from our commercial initiatives including differentiated products for our customers known as branded fares and an improving revenue environment we continue to differentiate our product offerings and enable customer choice through segmentation including offering basic economy throughout our domestic network our domestic operations closed 2017 with three consecutive quarters of yearoveryear unit revenue growth with robust demand for both business and leisure we continue to see improvements in business markets with 81 of the top 100 business markets producing positive yields during the december 2017 quarter up from 50 from earlier in the year 

passenger revenues related to our international regions increased 05 yearoveryear primarily due to strength in the atlantic and latin america regions partially offset by revenue declines in the pacific during 2017 we continued to roll out the expansion of our branded fares product throughout the international regions 

the atlantic region closed 2017 with three consecutive quarters of yearoveryear unit revenue growth on strong business class bookings we continue to leverage our alliance partners hub positions in europes leading business markets of london amsterdam and paris to increase the volume of us pointofsale traffic the uk was particularly robust with unit revenue growth throughout 2017 including doubledigit growth in the second half of 2017 during the year we expanded our basic economy product to mitigate the impact of ultralow cost carrier capacity increases 

unit revenue declines in the pacific primarily resulted from industry capacity growth in the region we continued to optimize the pacific region with a 77 reduction in capacity during 2017 focused on refining the network to generate incremental value from our chinese and korean alliances and differentiating our product offerings including expanding basic economy and selling comfort as a separate fare product during 2017 we reached an agreement to create a transpacific joint venture with korean air offering an enhanced and expanded network industryleading products and service and a seamless customer experience between the us and asia we also retired our last b747400 and introduced our new a350900 with delta one suites and the delta premium select cabin on routes from detroit to tokyonarita and seoulincheon which are driving improvements in both profitability and customer feedback these efforts are beginning to show results as the pacific returned to positive prasm growth during the december 2017 quarter for the first time in more than four years 

unit revenues increased in latin america principally resulting from unit revenue improvement in brazil related to both improved traffic and higher fares this improvement was driven by the strengthening of the brazilian economy and additional connectivity for our customers provided by our relationship with gol increased leisure traffic to mexico and the caribbean and the incremental value provided by our alliance with aeroméxico also contributed to the latin america unit revenue improvement although unit revenue improved in the caribbean hurricane damage in several markets during 2017 resulted in temporary service adjustments finally we continued to differentiate our product offerings including expanding basic economy and selling comfort as a separate fare product in latin america 

other revenue 



loyalty programs we sell mileage credits to credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies under marketing agreements we allocate the consideration received from mileage credit sales to the individual products and services bundled with the sale based on their relative selling prices we defer the travel component as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are redeemed for travel the revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables such as lounge access baggage fee waivers and brand usage is recorded in other revenue we recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed 

the amount of loyalty program revenue changes based on the price paid for mileage credits the volume of credits sold and our allocation of selling price to the individual products and services with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018 we will increase the value we use to account for the travel component within mileage credit sales this new value for the travel component will cause a reallocation of the consideration received from mileage credit sales the reallocation will result in less revenue recognized for loyalty programs in other revenue and more revenue in passenger revenue as the frequent flyer awards are redeemed 

loyalty program revenue increased compared to 2016 related to growth in our cobrand credit card partnership with american express additional information about our frequent flyer program accounting policies can be found in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

administrative fees club and onboard sales these revenues primarily relate to travelrelated services such as ticket changes and unaccompanied minors and also include amounts collected for onboard sales and sky club lounge memberships we recognize revenue as these services are performed a significant portion of these fees are travelrelated and performed in conjunction with the passenger’s flight therefore the majority of these fees will be reclassified to passenger revenue with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018 

ancillary businesses and refinery ancillary businesses and refinery includes aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties our vacation wholesale operations and refinery sales to third parties ancillary businesses and refinery revenues are not related to the generation of a seat mile ancillary businesses and refinery sales primarily increased due to sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery consistent with stronger pricing of refined products throughout the oil industry 

baggage fees the revenue amount shown above represents baggage fees that were sold as a separate component of the passenger’s ticket similar to administrative fees described above baggage services are performed and earned in conjunction with the passenger’s flight and these fees will be reclassified to passenger revenue with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018 

operating expense 



salaries and related costs the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to increases for eligible merit ground and flight attendant employees implemented in the june 2017 quarter 

aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers fuel expense increased 771 million compared to the prior year due to a 223 increase in the market price per gallon of fuel partially offset by reduced fuel hedge losses compared to the prior year and profits generated within our refinery segment the table below presents fuel expense including our regional carriers 



 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted nongaap financial measures 



 

depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation expense primarily results from new aircraft deliveries including b737900er a321200 a330300 and a350900 aircraft fleet modifications and accelerated depreciation due to the planned retirement of our md88 fleet and two b767300er aircraft 

contracted services the increase in contracted services expense predominantly relates to additional contract labor expenses associated with investments in our technology infrastructure and other activities to improve the customer experience 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consist of costs associated with the maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and costs associated with maintenance sales to third parties by our mro business the increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense primarily relates to an increase in maintenance activity in order to enhance service reliability of certain aircraft 

passenger service passenger service expense includes the costs of onboard food and beverage cleaning and supplies the increase in passenger service expense predominantly relates to costs associated with enhancements to our onboard product offering and higher traffic 

aircraft rent the increase in aircraft rent primarily results from new leased aircraft deliveries since the prior year including b737900er and a321200 aircraft 

other the increase in other expense primarily relates to costs associated with sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery 

results of operations  2016 compared to 2015 

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue decreased 10 billion over the prior year prasm decreased 49 and passenger mile yield decreased 45 on 21 higher capacity load factor was 03 points lower than the prior year at 846 

unit revenues of the domestic region decreased 52 resulting from weakness in the closein yield environment during most of the year despite strong volume 

revenues related to our international regions decreased 72 yearoveryear primarily due to yield declines resulting from imbalances between supply and demand principally in the atlantic region and china the impact of foreign currency fluctuations continued reductions in international fuel surcharges and economic challenges in certain regions 

in the atlantic the unit revenue decline predominantly resulted from lower yields driven by industry capacity growth outpacing passenger demand and the strength of the us dollar in core european markets us pointofsale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the brussels airport terrorist attack in march 2016 however europe pointof sale demand was soft largely due to the impact of weaker euro exchange rates 

unit revenue declines in the pacific compared to 2015 primarily resulted from lower yen hedge gains lower international fuel surcharges and yield declines resulting from industry capacity growth between the us and china during the september 2016 quarter the us department of transportation announced that we were awarded two daytime slot pairs at tokyos haneda airport from los angeles and minneapolis we commenced these routes and canceled other routes in the pacific region during the december 2016 quarter as part of our ongoing optimization of the pacific region 

although latin america unit revenues declined compared to 2015 unit revenues improved in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015 an open skies agreement between the us and mexico took effect in august 2016 and our application for antitrust immunity with aeroméxico was approved in the december 2016 quarter which continued to strengthen our performance in the important mexican business markets 

cargo revenue 

cargo revenue decreased 145 million or 178 primarily due to weaker international demand compared to the prior year 

other revenue 



 

other revenue increased 85 million or 17 in 2016 primarily due to increased loyalty programs revenues from our cobrand credit card partnership with american express resulting from new credit card accounts 

operating expense 



salaries and related costs the increase in salaries and related costs was principally due to pay rate increases given to eligible employees which includes an 18 pay rate increase for pilots resulting from a new pilot contract ratified in the december 2016 quarter that was retroactive to january 1 2016 additionally in the december 2015 quarter base pay rates increased 145 for eligible merit ground and flight attendant employees in conjunction with changes in their profit sharing program 

aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers fuel expense decreased 16 billion compared to the prior year due to an 18 decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel and lower fuel hedge losses partially offset by a loss from our refinery segment in the current year compared to a profit in the prior year and a 07 increase in consumption 

the table below presents fuel expense including our regional carriers 



  

 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted 



 

regional carriers expense the increase in regional carriers expense was primarily due to increases in aircraft maintenance and scheduled contract carrier rate escalations partially offset by lower fuel cost from the decrease in the market price of fuel 

contracted services the increase in contracted services expense predominantly related to costs associated with the 21 increase in capacity and additional temporary staffing 

profit sharing the decrease in profit sharing was primarily due to an adjustment to the profit sharing calculation during 2016 paid out in 2017 for merit ground and flight attendant employees this adjusted calculation paid 10 of annual profit as defined by the terms of the program and if we exceeded our prioryear results the program paid 20 of the yearoveryear increase in profit to eligible employees in 2015 our profit sharing program paid 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion the profit sharing program for pilots remained unchanged from the prior year 

nonoperating results 



at december 31 2016 the principal amount of debt and capital leases was 74 billion  during 2017 we issued 25 billion of unsecured notes as a result of the debt issuances partially offset by scheduled principal payments the amount of debt and capital leases was 89 billion at december 31 2017  

miscellaneous net is primarily composed of our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investments in virgin atlantic and grupo aeroméxico foreign exchange gainslosses and charitable contributions our equity investment earnings and foreign exchange gainslosses vary and impact the comparability of miscellaneous net from period to period 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2017 was 372  we recorded a provisional estimate of 150 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 resulting in a 26 increase to our effective tax rate we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 21 and 23 for 2018 at december 31 2017  we had approximately 51 billion of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards which do not begin to expire until 2027  accordingly we believe we will not pay cash federal income taxes before 2019 see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

refinery segment 

the refinery primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 200000 barrels per day for use in our airline operations during 2017  we believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinerys operation has contributed to the reduction in the market price of jet fuel and thus lowered our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would have been 

the refinery recorded operating revenues of 50 billion in 2017  compared to 38 billion in 2016  operating revenues in 2017 were primarily composed of 32 billion of nonjet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel and 886 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment refinery revenues increased compared to the prior year due to higher product demand and an increase in margins during the second half of 2017 due to hurricanes that caused extensive refinery closures on the gulf coast for several weeks 

the refinery recorded income of 110 million in 2017  compared to a loss of 125 million recorded in 2016  the refinerys income in 2017 was primarily due to higher refined product cracks lower crude costs and higher throughput levels 

a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market the refinery operated by monroe purchases the majority of its rins requirement in the secondary market we recognized 159 million and 171 million of expense related to the rins requirement in 2017 and 2016  respectively rins expense decreased during 2017 primarily as a result of a slight decrease in the unit cost of rins during 2017 after a significant increase in the unit cost of rins during 2016 

the monroe refinery is planning for a shutdown of approximately 60 days in the december 2018 quarter this planned outage called a turnaround is in accordance with the long term maintenance plan for the facility to allow for the safe completion of major repairs and upgrades during that planned outage we have identified other sources of fuel to maintain service levels and to mitigate the financial impact 

for more information regarding the refinerys results see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2017  we had 51 billion in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 25 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities during 2017  we used existing cash and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures of 39 billion  purchase shares of grupo aeroméxico and air franceklm for 12 billion and return 24 billion to shareholders in addition we used the proceeds from a debt offering and cash generated from operations to contribute 32 billion in cash to fund our pension obligation 

sources of liquidity 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated positive cash flows from operations of 51 billion in 2017  72 billion in 2016 and 79 billion in 2015  we also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2018  we had lower operating cash flows in 2017 compared to prior years primarily due to incremental pension plan contributions partially funded through 20 billion of debt issuance 

our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months 

fuel  including our regional carriers fuel expense represented 192 of our total operating expenses for 2017  the market price for jet fuel is highly volatile which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations from period to period 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the pension protection act of 2006 in the first half of 2017 we contributed 35 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans using net proceeds from a 20 billion debt issuance shares of our common stock from treasury with a value of 350 million and existing cash as a result of these contributions we satisfied on an accelerated basis our 2017 required contributions for our defined benefit plans including more than 30 billion above the minimum funding requirements we contributed 13 billion and 12 billion in 2016 and 2015 respectively we have no minimum funding requirements in 2018 however in january 2018 we voluntarily contributed approximately 500 million to these plans 

profit sharing our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items 

we paid 11 billion in february 2017 15 billion in february 2016 and 11 billion in two payments 756 million in february 2015 and more than 300 million in october 2014 to our employees in recognition of their contributions toward meeting our financial goals during the year ended december 2017 we recorded 11 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2017 pretax profit which was paid to employees in february 2018 

effective october 1 2017 we aligned our profit sharing plans under a single formula under this formula our profit sharing program pays 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion prior to that time the profit sharing program for pilots used this formula but for 2016 and the first nine months of 2017 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees paid 10 of annual profit as defined by the terms of the program and if we exceeded our prioryear results the program paid 20 of the yearoveryear increase in profit to eligible employees for years prior to 2016 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees paid according to the current formula going forward all eligible employees will be paid profit sharing under the current formula 

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures were 39 billion in 2017  34 billion in 2016 and 29 billion in 2015  our capital expenditures during 2017 were primarily related to the purchase of b737900er aircraft to replace a portion of our older b757200 aircraft purchases of a321200 and a330300 aircraft advanced deposit payments on future aircraft order commitments and seat density projects for our domestic fleet our capital expenditures during 2016 and 2015 were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and modifications to upgrade aircraft interiors that enhance our product offering 

we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft we expect that we will invest approximately 45 billion in 2018 primarily for 1 aircraft including deliveries of b737900ers a321200s and a350900s along with advance deposit payments for these and our new a330900neo and cs100 orders as well as for 2 aircraft modifications the majority of which relate to increasing the seat density and enhancing the cabins on our domestic fleet we expect that the 2018 investments will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations 

equity investments during 2017 we completed a 622 million tender offer and settled derivative contracts for 173 million to obtain additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico increasing our ownership percentage to a noncontrolling 49 equity stake in grupo aeroméxico  during the december 2017 quarter we acquired shares of air franceklm for 450 million which provides us with a 10 ownership interest 

los angeles international airport construction during 2016 we executed a new lease agreement with los angeles world airports lawa which owns and operates lax and announced plans to modernize upgrade and connect terminals 2 and 3 at lax over the next seven years based on the lease agreement we are designing and managing the construction of the initial investment of 350 million to renovate gate areas support space and other amenities for passengers upgrade the baggage handling systems in the terminals and facilitate the relocation of those airlines located in terminals 2 and 3 to terminals 5 and 6 and tom bradley international terminal tbit the relocation activities were completed during the june 2017 quarter subject to required approvals we have an option to expand the project which could cost an additional 15 billion and would include 1 redevelopment of terminal 3 and enhancement of terminal 2 2 rebuild of the ticketing arrival hall and security checkpoint 3 construction of infrastructure for the planned airport people mover 4 ramp improvements and 5 construction of a secure connector to the north side of tbit 

a substantial majority of the project costs will be funded through the regional airports improvement corporation raic a california public benefit corporation using an 800 million revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders the credit facility was executed during 2017 loans made under the credit facility will be repaid with the proceeds from lawa’s purchase of completed project assets we have guaranteed the obligations of the raic under the credit facility we expect to spend approximately 200 million on this project in 2018 using funding provided by the credit agreement andor cash flows from operations 

new yorklaguardia redevelopment as part of the terminal redevelopment project at laguardia airport we are partnering with the port authority of new york and new jersey the “port authority” to replace terminals c and d with a new stateoftheart terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across four concourses connected to a central headhouse the terminal will feature a new larger delta sky club wider concourses more gate seating and 30 percent more concessions space than the existing terminals the facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and dropoffpickup areas the design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026 

in connection with the redevelopment during 2017 we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the port authority with a term through 2050 pursuant to the lease agreement we will 1 fund through debt issuance and existing cash and undertake the design management and construction of the terminal and certain offpremises supporting facilities 2 receive a port authority contribution of 600 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure 3 be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and 4 have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to port authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers we currently expect our costs for the project to be approximately 33 billion and we bear the risks of project construction including if the project’s actual costs exceed the projected costs we expect to spend approximately 550 million on this project in 2018 using funding provided by cash flows from operations andor financing arrangements 

financing activities 

debt and capital leases the principal amount of debt and capital leases was 89 billion at december 31 2017  since december 31 2009 we have reduced our principal amount of debt and capital leases by 94 billion 

during the march 2017 quarter we issued 20 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes consisting of 10 billion of 2785 notes due 2020 and 10 billion of 3625 notes due 2022 as discussed above we used the net proceeds from this issuance to make a cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during the december 2017 quarter we issued 450 million in aggregate principal amount of 2600 notes due 2020 

our pacific facilities including the term loan with a principal balance of 10 billion  mature in october 2018 we expect to repay this obligation with cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents andor new financing arrangements

on february 9 2018 the board of directors declared a 03050 per share dividend for shareholders of record as of february 23 2018 

fuel hedge restructuring during 2016 we entered into transactions to defer settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2017 these deferral transactions excluding market movements from the date of inception provided approximately 300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2016 and required approximately 300 million in cash payments in 2017 

during the june 2016 quarter we early terminated certain of our outstanding deferral transactions and made cash payments of 170 million including normal settlements as a result during the year ended december 31 2017 we reported 20 million in cash receipts and 244 million in cash payments associated with these transactions for additional information regarding these transactions see note 4 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

undrawn lines of credit 

we have 25 billion available in undrawn revolving lines of credit our credit facilities have covenants including minimum collateral coverage ratios if we are not in compliance with these covenants we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them we currently have a substantial amount of unencumbered assets available to pledge as collateral 

covenants 

we were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at december 31 2017

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 



  

 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt 

longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using london interbank offered rates libor at december 31 2017  

operating lease payments represents our minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases including certain aircraft flown by regional carriers 

aircraft purchase commitments represents our commitments to purchase 100 a321200neo 93 a321200 75 cs100 41 b737900er 25 a330900neo and 19 a350900 aircraft 

contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with thirdparty regional carriers the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying 

employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our defined benefit pension plan obligations see critical accounting policies and estimates 

other obligations represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other thirdparty services and products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles program offers incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta delta connection and airlines that participate in the skymiles program as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines effective january 1 2015 the skymiles program was modified from a model in which customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on distance traveled to a model based on ticket price this award change did not affect the way we account for the program 

the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below these are 1 passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and 2 the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation we value each deliverable on a standalone basis our estimate of the selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers which is reevaluated at least annually we use established ticket prices to determine the estimated selling price of air transportation we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 

we defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales when the credits are earned and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately 50 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of mileage credits customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables as defined below 

our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express in december 2014 we amended our marketing agreements with american express which increased the value we receive under the agreements through 2022 the amended agreements became effective january 1 2015 we account for the agreements consistent with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered based on their relative selling prices we determined our best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta and 4 brand value the increased value received under the amended agreements increases the amount of deferred revenue for the travel component and increases the value of the other deliverables which are recognized in other revenue as they are provided 

we recognize revenue as we deliver each sales element we defer the travel deliverable mileage credits as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel the revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables is recorded in other revenue we recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed 

breakage for mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed breakage we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed we use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years at december 31 2017  the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 41 billion  a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 34 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2017  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both market capitalization and projected discounted future cash flows an income approach when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 3 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows 2 terminal period revenue growth and cash flows 3 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 4 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 5 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinitelived to definitelived factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot restrictions or additional open skies agreements 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets 

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances the stabilized operating environment for us airlines has also contributed to improved financial results 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion at december 31 2017  based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 48 billion at december 31 2017  of which 47 billion related to indefinitelived intangible assets indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements 

we performed qualitative assessments of our indefinitelived intangible assets including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors which impact the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 266 billion at december 31 2017  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we review flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired factors which could be indicators of impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals as of december 31 2017  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 70 billion  during 2017  we contributed 35 billion to these plans we have no minimum funding requirements in 2018 however in january 2018 we voluntarily contributed approximately 500 million to these plans the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on highquality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 369 and 420 at december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 413 to 457 between 2015 and 2017 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity fixed income real assets hedge funds and other assets and instruments our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2017 was 896  

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



life expectancy  changes in life expectancy may significantly change our benefit obligations and future expense we use the society of actuaries soa published mortality data other publicly available information and our own perspective of future longevity to develop our best estimate of life expectancy the soa publishes annual updated mortality tables for us plans and updated improvement scale each year we consider updates by the soa in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations 

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules alternative funding rules for defined benefit plans that are frozen we elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an 885 discount rate 

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards 

revenue from contracts with customers 

on january 1 2018 we will adopt asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 using the full retrospective method while the adoption will not have a significant impact on earnings the classification of certain revenues that are currently classified in other revenue will be reclassified to passenger revenue these include baggage fees administrative charges and other travelrelated fees all of which will be deemed part of the single performance obligation of providing passenger transportation these revenues which are approximately 2 billion annually will be reclassified from the current presentation in other revenue to passenger revenue 

in addition the adoption of the new standard increases the rate used to account for frequent flyer miles we currently analyze our standalone sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers to establish the accounting value for frequent flyer miles considering the guidance in the new standard we will change our valuation of a mileage credit to an analysis of the award redemption value the new valuation considers the value a passenger receives by redeeming miles rather than paying cash for an award ticket this change increases our frequent flyer liability by approximately 2 billion  the mileage deferral and redemption rates are approximately the same therefore assuming stable volume there would not be a significant change in revenue recognized from the program for a given period 

the adoption of the new standard will also reduce our air traffic liability by approximately 500 million  this change primarily results from estimating the tickets that will expire unused and recognizing revenue at the scheduled flight date rather than when the unused tickets expire 

retirement benefits 

in 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201707 compensation—retirement benefits topic 715 this standard requires an entity to report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs the other components of net benefit cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations in 2017 we recorded 50 million of nonservice costs that will be reclassified to nonoperating expense upon adoption this standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 we will adopt the standard effective january 1 2018 

see the table below for the unaudited impact resulting from the adoption of these standards on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

fuel price risk 

changes in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations we have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of fuel as fuel prices are subject to potential volatility a one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately 40 million of additional annual fuel expense 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2017  we had 53 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 32 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 160 million at december 31 2017 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 32 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2017  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a 17 million liability position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the japanese yen and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 34 million gain or 42 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2018

international alliances 

our international alliance relationships with foreign carriers are an important part of our business as they improve our access to international markets and enable us to market globally integrated air transportation services in general these arrangements include reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access arrangements and with some carriers may also include joint sales and marketing coordination colocation of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements these alliances also may present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements aircraft maintenance insourcing and joint procurement 

joint venture agreements we currently operate three joint ventures with foreign carriers these arrangements for which we have received antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation dot provide for joint commercial cooperation with our partners within the geographic scope of those arrangements including the sharing of revenues andor profits and losses generated by the parties on the joint venture routes as well as joint marketing and sales coordinated pricing and revenue management network planning and scheduling and other coordinated activities with respect to the parties operations on joint venture routes the three joint ventures are 

 

 



enhanced commercial agreements with foreign carriers we have separate strategic equity investments in grupo aeroméxico sab de cv the parent company of aeroméxico and in gol linhas aéreas inteligentes sa the parent company of vrg linhas aéreas operating as gol and an exclusive commercial relationship with each air carrier we invested in aeroméxico and gol because they operate in latin americas two largest markets mexico and brazil respectively our commercial agreements with each of these carriers separately provide for expansion of reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation airport lounge access arrangements improved passenger connections and joint sales cooperation 

we intend to further expand our relationship with aeroméxico through a joint venture on flights between the us and mexico that will allow us to compete more effectively on these routes we have received conditional approvals from governmental authorities for this joint venture and plan to implement it in the first half of 2017 we have commenced a tender offer for additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico the parent company of aeroméxico that would result in us owning up to 49 of the outstanding shares in addition to our commercial cooperation arrangements for passenger service with aeroméxico we and aeroméxico have established a joint venture relating to an airframe maintenance repair and overhaul operation located in queretaro mexico 

we also own shares of china eastern and entered into a commercial agreement with them during 2015 to expand our relationship and better connect the networks of the two airlines the expanded commercial agreement is designed to allow the carriers to compete more effectively on routes between the us and china provide more travel options for customers in both countries and make joint investments in the customer experience 

skyteam  in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam global airline alliance the other members of skyteam are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico air europa air france alitalia china airlines china eastern china southern csa czech airlines garuda indonesia kenya airways klm korean air middle east airlines saudi arabian airlines tarom vietnam airlines and xiamen airlines through alliance arrangements with other skyteam carriers delta is able to link its network with the route networks of the other member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer arrangements airport lounge access programs and coordinated cargo operations 

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets approximately 17 of our passenger revenue in 2016 was related to flying by these regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program delta connection we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our dl designator code we have contractual arrangements with 

 

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our dl designator code we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

skywest airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement this proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles ® frequent flyer program skymiles program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage credit for travel awards by flying on delta its regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits miles do not expire but are subject to the program rules we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs ® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards on partner airlines are subject to capacitycontrolled seating we offer lastseat availability for travel awards on our own flights including delta connection flights in 2016  program members redeemed more than 326 billion miles in the skymiles program for 134 million award redemptions during this period 79 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

general 

we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

monroe energy 

our wholly owned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively monroe operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk these companies are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers we own monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our new york operations 

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining approximately 195000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined products nonjet fuel products monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers 

strategic agreements monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations 

segments  because the products and services of monroes refinery operations are discrete from our airline services segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment   financial information on our segment reporting can be found in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel hedging program 

we have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel as jet fuel prices are subject to potential volatility we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations however it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel and crude oil weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect all of the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china cargo airlines china southern cargo czech airlines cargo and korean air cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

ancillary businesses 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul mro staffing and other services vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations in 2016  the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 1 billion 

   

 

 

 

distribution and expanded product offerings 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including 1 digital channels such as deltacom and mobile applications  web 2 telephone reservations 3 online travel agencies and 4 traditional brick and mortar and other agencies we make fare and product information widely available across those channels ensuring customers always receive the best information and service options an increasing number of our tickets are sold through delta digital direct channels driving more direct personalized interactions with our customers and reducing distribution costs 

  

we have transformed distribution to a more retail oriented merchandised approach by introducing welldefined and differentiated products for our customers we offer distinct travel experiences with clear value propositions that enable customer choice delta one tm  delta premium select first class and delta comfort tm include premium amenities and services while main cabin and basic economy allow varying levels of pretravel flexibility as well as exceptional service once onboard the aircraft we expect that these merchandising initiatives as implemented across all of deltas distribution channels will allow customers to better understand our product offerings make it easier to buy the products they desire and increase customer satisfaction this merchandising effort is most effective in deltas digital channels where customers can compare all product options in a single easy to understand display 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs the industry is transforming through consolidation both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is increasing from governmentowned and funded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and southeast asia are governmentsubsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have altered competition in international markets 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the faa exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding essential air services which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia and jfk in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a number of international federal state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment including regulation of greenhouse gases and other air emissions noise reduction water discharges aircraft drinking water storage and use of petroleum and other regulated substances and the management and disposal of hazardous waste substances and materials 

emissions  greenhouse gas emissions by the aviation industry and their impact on climate change have become a particular focus in the international community and within the us for several years the european union has required its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its emissions trading scheme ets under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the ets was amended to apply only to flights within the european economic area from 2013 through 2016 as a result we operated a limited number of flights subject to the ets through 2016 unless the eu amends the current legislation following the 2016 assembly of the international civil aviation organization icao the ets will apply to all flights originating or landing in the european union beginning in 2017 

in october 2016 icao formally adopted a global marketbased emissions offset program known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation this program is designed to achieve a mediumterm goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbonneutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2020 a pilot phase of the offset program will begin in 2021 followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 and a second phase beginning in 2027 countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase but participation in the second phase is mandatory in 2016 icao also adopted new aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide co 2  emissions from aircraft the new aircraft certification standards apply to virtually all types of aircraft that make up the global commercial fleet and will be phased in between 2020 and 2028 

separately the us has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2628 from 2005 levels by 2025 the us has made this pledge in connection with the 2015 united nations framework convention on climate change reached in paris by over 190 countries which the us and china formally ratified in september 2016 the us has proposed a number of domestic greenhouse gas regulations to help achieve this goal 

in july 2016 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final finding under the clean air act that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and further determined that aircraft cause or contribute to greenhouse gases the endangerment finding does not establish standards but triggers an obligation for the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft the epa has historically implemented air emissions control standards adopted by icao therefore the icao engine certification standards are expected to influence the development of any epa greenhouse gas emission standards for aircraft 

we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions additional regulation could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

we seek to minimize the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our greenhouse gas emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement of older less fuel efficient aircraft and replacement with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted renewable fuel standards rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa 

other environmental matters  we are subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites soil andor ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address these impacts we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the craf program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2017 the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the nmb an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day cooling off period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board peb to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the status quo for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in self help self help includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 84000 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 19 of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



in addition 199 refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2019 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act nlra  which generally allows either party to engage in self help upon the expiration of the agreement 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors relating to delta 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of such events could have a significant adverse effect on our business the attacks of september 11 2001 and the aftermath materially impacted the business financial condition and operating results of our company as it did for the rest of the airline industry despite significantly heightened security measures at airports and airlines the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups we constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically both with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry in addition the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant security events whether from external or internal sources also pose a significant risk to our operations these events can include random acts of violence and can occur in public areas that we cannot control 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of such events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds in addition potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring reputational harm and other costs if any or all of these types of events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel over the last decade fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile during the last several years in 2016  our average fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges was 149  a 216 decrease from our average fuel price in 2015  in 2015  our average fuel price per gallon was 190  a 452 decrease from our average fuel price in 2014  in 2014  our average fuel price per gallon was 347  which was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 183  230 and 354 of our operating expense in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively 

our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry at times in the past we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel the effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and marktomarket adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results 

we have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel as jet fuel prices are subject to potential volatility we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates our hedging program may not be successful in providing price protection due to market conditions and the choice of hedging instruments in addition we record marktomarket adjustments mtm adjustments on our fuel hedges mtm adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods losses from rebalancing or mtm adjustments or both may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our fuel hedge contracts typically contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may require us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

if monroes cost of producing nonjet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers we expect to continue exploring similar noncontrolling investments in and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these investments involve significant challenges and risks including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

in addition we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers we do not have control over their operations or business methods we may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures these changes could result from factors that are not under our control a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where it may be difficult to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2016  approximately 19 of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the nlra which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub gateway or key airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub gateway or key airports including amsterdam boston detroit londonheathrow los angeles minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city seattle and tokyonarita each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other delta hubs and gateways a significant extended interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs gateways or other key airports could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

as a regular part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time as a result of these types of risks we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data the compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business 

disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend such as power telecommunications or the internet the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers and other security issues a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our network including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our customer service and result in increased costs while we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

failure of our technology to perform reliably could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in deltacom mobile device applications checkin kiosks customer service applications airport information displays and related initiatives including security for these initiatives the performance reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers if our technology does not perform reliably our business and operations would be negatively affected which could be material 

our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters or other environmental events can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by our thirdparty regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including thirdparty carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations in particular some thirdparty regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines if this shortage becomes more widespread thirdparty regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us to the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

in particular under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases we cannot predict the future prices of rins purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroes products could limit the refinerys production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management personnel and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market as a result we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is increasing from governmentowned and funded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and southeast asia are governmentsubsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory 

increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast us have included concepts such as congestionbased landing fees slot auctions or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the us while enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until 2017 we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the european union if fully implemented other environmental laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies are reviewing airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally with approximately 30 of our revenues from operations outside of the us our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

economic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the united kingdom’s exit from the european union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the uk approved an exit from the european union eu the uk government is expected to initiate a process to leave the eu often referred to as brexit and begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the airline industry faces substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the likely exit of the uk from the eu adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation of the airline industry or bilateral agreements governing air travel could have a negative impact on our operations financial condition and results of operations 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness or fear of such an event can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

  

in 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed against delta and airtran airways airtran alleging that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtrans ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag deltas imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtrans imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the first bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings and remain pending in the northern district of georgia on july 12 2016 the court issued an order granting the plaintiffs motion for class certification on october 7 2016 the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit granted the defendants petition for interlocutory review of this order and that appeal remains pending in addition the defendants have filed motions for summary judgment which also remain pending delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits 

capacity antitrust litigation 

in july 2015 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed alleging that delta american united and southwest had conspired to restrain capacity the lawsuits were filed in the wake of media reports that the us department of justice had served civil investigative demands upon these carriers seeking documents and information relating to this subject the lawsuits have been consolidated into a single multidistrict litigation proceeding in the us district court for the district of columbia in november 2016 the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the claims and the matter is now proceeding through discovery delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial highlights  2016 compared to 2015 

our pretax income for 2016 was 66 billion  representing a 521 million decrease compared to the prior year as lower passenger revenue and higher salaries and related costs offset the benefits of lower fuel prices pretax income adjusted for special items a nongaap financial measure was 61 billion  an increase of 206 million or 35 special items in 2016 were related to fuel hedge mtm adjustments and settlements and virgin atlantic mtm adjustments which totaled 450 million and 115 million  respectively 

revenue our operating revenue decreased 11 billion  or 26  and passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm decreased 49 on 21 higher capacity compared to 2015 the decrease in prasm was largely driven by competitive pressure in the current low fuel price environment and the impact of us dollar strength on tickets sold in international markets which are predominantly priced in local currency 

operating expense total operating expense decreased 215 million and our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile casm decreased 26 to 1298 cents compared to 2015  primarily due to lower fuel prices partially offset by higher salaries and related costs during 2016 brent crude oil averaged 44 per barrel compared to the average of nearly 52 per barrel during 2015 salaries and related costs were higher as a result of the pay rate increase for pilots resulting from a new pilot contract ratified in the december 2016 quarter that was retroactive to january 1 2016 and pay rate increases for eligible merit ground and flight attendant employees effective in the december 2015 quarter 

nonfuel unit costs casmex including profit sharing a nongaap financial measure increased 37 to 1013 cents due to the pay rate increases discussed above and other product and service investments which were partially offset by productivity gains from our fleet technology and supply chain initiatives 

the nongaap financial measures for pretax income adjusted for special items and casmex used above and adjusted net debt used below are defined and reconciled in supplemental information below 

company initiatives 

our employees are an important part of deltas success and underpin the quality customer service and operational reliability that is core to deltas brand during the december 2016 quarter delta pilots ratified a new contract that included an 18 pay rate increase that was retroactive to january 1 2016 this increase for pilots followed pay rate increases for the majority of other employees during the december 2015 quarter in addition our profit sharing payment to employees in february 2017 will be the third consecutive annual profit sharing payment of more than one billion dollars we have paid eligible employees more than 5 billion in profit sharing since the program started in 2007 we expect to continue to pay our employees industry leading total compensation because sharing the success that our employees help produce is core to deltas culture and important to providing the best travel experience for our customers and producing solid results for shareholders 

running a reliable customerfocused airline has produced a solid return on invested capital roic see calculation in supplemental information below of 261 in 2016 despite the pressure from employee investments discussed above this financial performance has allowed us to improve our balance sheet by reducing debt and capital lease obligations to 73 billion and adjusted net debt a nongaap financial measure to 61 billion increase funding of our defined benefit pension plans and increase the amount of capital returned to our shareholders we are focused on delivering additional value for shareholders in the future through revenue growth cost productivity and prudent deployment of cash flows 

driving revenue growth 

operational reliability 

a key driver of our revenue growth is higher customer satisfaction resulting from strong operational reliability we have significantly invested in our business since 2010 to improve our operational performance which consistently ranks first among the major us carriers during 2016 we operated 241 days with zero mainline canceled flights a nearly 50 improvement over our 2015 performance in addition our reported completion factor of 996 and ontime arrival rate of nearly 87 places us at the top of the major global us carriers this operational excellence resulted in consistent increases in our domestic net promoter score including our highest reported score of 44 in november 

global strategy 

we continue to expand our global network by strengthening our presence in major and developing markets around the world in an effort to increase and diversify our network into high revenue and high growth markets the growth of our global presence will enable customers to seamlessly connect to more places while enjoying a consistent highquality travel experience we are deploying this strategy through investments and relationships in the atlantic latin america and the pacific 

atlantic in 2017 we plan to build on our presence in our strategically advantaged hubs in london paris and amsterdam while deemphasizing higher europe pointofsale markets alongside our 49 equity investment in virgin atlantic we have an antitrust immunized joint venture with the ukbased carrier this joint venture has significantly improved our presence in london one of the largest revenue markets from the us while also enhancing our transatlantic network including our existing joint venture relationship with air franceklm and alitalia our atlantic senior decisionmaking functions are located in europe for close coordination with our joint venture airlines 

latin america we are focused on maximizing the value of our relationships with other carriers in latin america while deriving value from the recent investments in our network product and service 

during 2015 we announced our intention to create an antitrust immunized commercial joint venture with aeroméxico and to acquire additional shares of the capital stock of grupo aeroméxico through a cash tender offer both subject to regulatory approvals the mexican and us regulators approved antitrust immunity for the joint venture during 2016 subject to certain conditions delta and aeroméxico have accepted the conditions and are in the process of implementing the necessary actions in order to satisfy the conditions we expect both the joint venture to be implemented and the tender offer to be completed in the first half of 2017 as a result of the tender offer when combined with our current holdings and derivative positions we would own up to 49 of the outstanding capital stock of grupo aeroméxico 

we also own 95 of gols outstanding capital stock as part of our longterm strategy to strengthen the opportunity we see in brazil in conjunction with our investment we and gol have extended our existing commercial agreements 

pacific we continue to execute the multiyear restructuring of our pacific operations by reorienting our network from tokyonarita to shanghai through our partnership with china eastern airlines and seoul through our partnership with korean air during 2016 the us department of transportation announced that we have been awarded two daytime slot pairs at tokyos haneda airport from los angeles and minneapolis we commenced these routes and canceled other routes in the pacific region during the december 2016 quarter concurrent with these changes we are increasing our presence in china the largest transpacific market from the us we hold a 32 stake in china eastern and are expanding our relationship through colocation in the same terminal at shanghai’s pudong airport for a seamless travel experience china eastern is one of the largest airlines in china with a route network covering more than 200 destinations in over 25 countries in addition we are working to expand our transpacific partnership with korean air including expanded codeshare offerings and the commencement of a daily nonstop flight between atlanta and seoul during the june 2017 quarter 

cost productivity 

over the longterm we continue to focus on maintaining the rate of nonfuel unit cost growth at less than 2 annually we continue to leverage our expertise in supply chain and aircraft maintenance to improve our productivity additionally we are investing in technology projects to improve the customer experience in a costefficient manner 

prudent deployment of cash flows 

as part of our previously announced longterm goals we target 89 billion in annual operating cash flow and 45 billion in annual free cash flow we use approximately 50 of our operating cash flow to reinvest in the business for longterm growth opportunities the remaining free cash flow is used to further strengthen the balance sheet to reduce debt levels make incremental pension contributions and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

investing in our facilities 

we are working closely with airport authorities throughout our network to enhance facilities in order to both improve our operational efficiency and to better serve our customers these efforts include but are not limited to future airport renovation and redevelopment projects at new yorklaguardia airport los angeles international airport lax and hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport and the recentlycompleted redevelopment of new yorkjfk airport in addition we are modernizing our sky clubs including the recent openings of flagship locations in atlanta and seattle and improving the food beverage and services offered throughout the sky club network finally we continue to make significant investments in technologies that improve the customer experience including deltacom mobile device applications checkin kiosks employee customer service applications and airport information displays 

strengthened balance sheet 

a key tenet of our strategy is to operate the company with investment grade financial metrics since beginning our balance sheet improvement strategy in 2009 we have reduced our adjusted net debt by nearly 11 billion which has significantly reduced our annual interest expense as a result of these efforts we have received upgrades to our credit ratings by all three major ratings agencies including investment grade ratings from moodys and fitch in addition because we have a significant net underfunded pension liability we have been making pension contributions above the minimum amount required our goal remains to achieve at least an 80 funded status for the pension plan by 2020 

increased capital returns to owners 

while we have been reducing our debt levels and investing in the business we have been increasing our capital returns to shareholders returning a total of 31 billion in 2016 through dividends and share repurchases since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013 we have increased the dividend per share by 50 annually and paid 12 billion in total dividends including 509 million in 2016 through dividends and share repurchases we have returned nearly 74 billion to shareholders since 2013 while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 14 compared to the beginning of 2013 

results of operations  2016 compared to 2015 

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue decreased 10 billion over the prior year prasm decreased 49 and passenger mile yield decreased 45 on 21 higher capacity load factor was 03 points lower than the prior year at 846  

unit revenues of the domestic region decreased 52  resulting from weakness in the closein yield environment during most of the year despite strong volume 

revenues related to our international regions decreased 72 yearoveryear primarily due to yield declines resulting from imbalances between supply and demand principally in the atlantic region and china the impact of foreign currency fluctuations continued reductions in international fuel surcharges and economic challenges in certain regions 

in the atlantic the unit revenue decline predominantly resulted from lower yields driven by industry capacity growth 

outpacing passenger demand and the strength of the us dollar in core european markets us pointofsale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the brussels airport terrorist attack in march however europe pointof sale demand has been soft largely due to the impact of weaker euro exchange rates in 2017 we will continue to build on our presence in our strategically advantaged hubs in london paris and amsterdam 

unit revenue declines in the pacific compared to 2015 primarily resulted from lower yen hedge gains lower international fuel surcharges and yield declines resulting from industry capacity growth between the us and china we expect the significant capacity growth over the last three years in the us to shanghai market to slow in 2017 as both chinese and us carriers reach their respective frequency caps during the september 2016 quarter the us department of transportation announced that we have been awarded two daytime slot pairs at tokyos haneda airport from los angeles and minneapolis we commenced these routes and canceled other routes in the pacific region during the december 2016 quarter as part of our ongoing optimization of the pacific region 

although latin america unit revenues declined compared to 2015 unit revenues improved in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015 we expect these positive trends to continue in 2017 as we continue to invest in higher performing mexican business markets an open skies agreement between the us and mexico took effect in august 2016 and our application for antitrust immunity with aeroméxico was approved in the december 2016 quarter which should continue to strengthen our performance in the important mexican business markets 

cargo revenue 

cargo revenue decreased 145 million  or 178  primarily due to weaker international demand compared to the prior year 

other revenue 



 

other revenue increased 85 million  or 17  in 2016 primarily due to increased loyalty programs revenues from our cobrand credit card partnership with american express resulting from new credit card accounts 

operating expense 



 

salaries and related costs the increase in salaries and related costs was principally due to pay rate increases given to eligible employees which includes an 18 pay rate increase for pilots resulting from a new pilot contract ratified in the december 2016 quarter that was retroactive to january 1 2016 additionally in the december 2015 quarter base pay rates increased 145 for eligible merit ground and flight attendant employees in conjunction with changes in their profit sharing program 

aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers fuel expense decreased 16 billion compared to the prior year due to an 18 decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel and lower fuel hedge losses partially offset by a loss from our refinery segment in the current year compared to a profit in the prior year and a 07 increase in consumption the table below presents fuel expense including our regional carriers 



 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted nongaap financial measures 



 

regional carriers expense the increase in regional carriers expense was primarily due to increases in aircraft maintenance and scheduled contract carrier rate escalations partially offset by lower fuel cost from the decrease in the market price of fuel 

contracted services the increase in contracted services expense predominantly related to costs associated with the 21 increase in capacity and additional temporary staffing 

profit sharing the decrease in profit sharing was primarily due to an adjustment to the profit sharing calculation our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items beginning with 2016 to be paid out in 2017 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees was adjusted to pay 10 of annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program and if we exceed our prioryear results the program will pay 20 of the yearoveryear increase in pretax profit to eligible employees for years prior to 2016 our profit sharing program paid 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion the profit sharing program for pilots remains unchanged from the prior year and will continue under its current terms 

results of operations  2015 compared to 2014 

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue decreased 172 million over the prior year prasm decreased 33 and passenger mile yield decreased 37 on 30 higher capacity load factor was 02 points higher than the prior year at 849 

unit revenues of the mainline domestic region decreased 06 resulting from weaker yields in certain markets which were nearly offset by the strong performance in atlanta new york seattle and los angeles 

regional carriers passenger revenue decreased 61 on a 40 reduction in capacity during 2015 we removed thirty 50seat regional aircraft as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet 

revenues related to our international regions decreased 60 yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of the strong us dollar and reductions in international fuel surcharges these challenges were addressed through capacity reductions implemented in the december 2015 quarter 

in the atlantic region unit revenue declines in africa the middle east and russia were partially offset by strength in core european markets unit revenue declines in the pacific primarily resulted from the strength of the us dollar and lower international fuel surcharges we continued to optimize the pacific region in order to improve margins by reducing our winter capacity including the cancellation of our seattle to tokyohaneda route in the june 2015 quarter and downgauging via the continued retirement of the b747400 fleet during the second half of 2015 in addition we made a strategic investment in and established a longterm commercial relationship with china eastern latin america saw capacity growth of 57 the majority of which occurred during the first half of 2015 in the december 2015 quarter we continued to invest in higher performing markets such as mexico and the caribbean while reducing capacity in brazil due to its challenging economic environment 

other revenue 



 

other revenue increased 635 million or 142 primarily due to loyalty program revenues including our agreement with american express thirdparty refinery sales and maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business 

operating expense 



 

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs was primarily due to higher pilot and flight attendant block hours and pay rate increases implemented in both the first half of 2015 and december 2015 base pay rates increased 145 for eligible merit ground and flight attendant employees effective december 1 2015 

aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers fuel expense decreased 59 billion compared to the prior year due to a 435 decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel an increase in monroes profitability and reduced hedge losses partially offset by a 24 increase in consumption the table below presents fuel expense including our regional carriers 



  



the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted 



 

regional carriers expense the reduction in regional carriers expense was primarily due to lower fuel cost from a decrease in the price per gallon of fuel lower capacity and reduced maintenance expenses during 2015 we removed thirty 50seat 

regional aircraft as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet 

contracted services the increase in contracted services expense predominantly related to costs associated with the 30 increase in capacity and additional temporary staffing 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to investments in new a330300 b737900er and crj900 aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering 

landing fees and other rents landing fees and other rents increased principally due to an increased number of departures and higher rental rates 

profit sharing the increase in profit sharing was driven by an increase in full year pretax income compared to the prior year our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items for years prior to 2016 our profit sharing program paid 10 to all employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion 

beginning with 2016 pretax profit to be paid out in 2017 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees has been adjusted to pay 10 of annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program and if we exceed our prioryear results the program will pay 20 of the yearoveryear increase in pretax profit to eligible employees the profit sharing program for pilots remained unchanged and will continue in 2016 under its terms 

passenger service passenger service expense includes the costs for onboard food and beverage cleaning and supplies this expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to costs associated with enhancements to our onboard product offering and the 33 increase in traffic 

other other operating expense increased primarily due to costs associated with sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery 

nonoperating results 



the decline in interest expense net in both comparative periods resulted from reduced levels of debt and from the refinancing of debt obligations at lower interest rates the principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from 117 billion at the beginning of 2014 to 74 billion at december 31 2016  

miscellaneous net was favorable primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses compared to 2015 also contributing to the increase is our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investment in virgin atlantic the increase from virgin atlantic primarily resulted from yearoveryear profit and improvements in mtm adjustments on fuel hedges in 2015 miscellaneous net was favorable primarily due to a reduction in debt extinguishment losses together with yearoveryear profits and improvements in mtm adjustments on fuel hedges from virgin atlantic compared to 2014 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2016 was 341  we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 34 and 35 for 2017 the reduction in our rate from prior years was primarily related to differences in our global tax rates at december 31 2016  we had approximately 59 billion of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards which do not begin to expire until 2027  accordingly we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes before 2019 see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

refinery segment 

the refinery primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 175000 barrels per day for use in our airline operations during 2016  we believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinerys operation has contributed to the reduction in the market price of jet fuel and thus lowered our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would have been 

the refinery recorded operating revenues of 38 billion in 2016 compared to 47 billion in 2015 operating revenues in 2016 were primarily composed of 27 billion of nonjet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel and 695 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment refinery revenues decreased compared to the prior year due to an oversupply of crude in the market which drove lower pricing of refined products throughout the oil industry 

the refinery recorded a loss of 125 million in 2016  compared to profits of 290 million and 96 million recorded in 2015 and 2014 respectively the refinerys loss in 2016 compared to profits in the preceding two years was primarily due to higher rins costs and lower distillate crack spreads 

a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it has purchased its entire rins requirement in the secondary market we recognized 171 million  75 million and 111 million of expense related to the rins requirement in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively rins expense increased during 2016 primarily as a result of a significant increase in the unit cost of rins from approximately 58 cents per rin during 2015 to 84 cents per rin during 2016 

for more information regarding the refinerys results see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2016  we had 57 billion in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 32 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 25 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities during 2016  we generated 72 billion in cash from operating activities which we used to fund capital expenditures of 34 billion  return 31 billion to shareholders and reduce the principal on our debt and capital lease obligations by 13 billion 

sources of liquidity 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated positive cash flows from operations of 72 billion in 2016  79 billion in 2015 and 49 billion in 2014  we also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2017  

our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months 

fuel and fuel hedge margins  including our regional carriers fuel expense represented 183 of our total operating expenses for 2016  the market price for jet fuel is highly volatile which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations from period to period 

as part of our fuel hedging program we may be required to post margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position conversely if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position we may receive margin our future cash flows are impacted by the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying those derivative contracts our hedge contracts were in a net loss position at december 31 2016 and 2015 resulting in 38 million and 119 million respectively of margin postings to counterparties 

timing of skymiles sales in december 2011 we amended our american express agreements and agreed to sell 675 million of unrestricted skymiles to american express in each december from 2011 through 2014 pursuant to the december 2011 amendment american express purchased 675 million of unrestricted skymiles in each of those years with the final payment in 2014 the skymiles purchased in december 2014 were utilized by american express in 2015 there were no advanced sales of skymiles in 2015 or 2016 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the pension protection act of 2006 in 2016 we contributed 13 billion  including 950 million in cash and shares of our common stock from treasury with a value of 350 million to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during the first half of 2016 as a result of these contributions we satisfied on an accelerated basis our 2016 required contributions for our defined benefit plans including more than 750 million above the minimum funding requirements we contributed 12 billion and 917 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively we estimate our funding under these plans will total at least 12 billion in 2017  including 700 million above the minimum funding requirements 

profit sharing our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items 

we paid 15 billion in february 2016 11 billion in two payments 756 million in february 2015 and more than 300 million in october 2014 and 506 million in february 2014 to our employees in recognition of their contributions toward meeting our financial goals during the year ended december 2016 we recorded 11 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2016 pretax profit which will be paid to employees in february 2017 

beginning with 2016 to be paid out in 2017 the profit sharing program for merit ground and flight attendant employees was adjusted to pay 10 of annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program and if we exceed our prioryear results the program will pay 20 of the yearoveryear increase in pretax profit to eligible employees for years prior to 2016 our profit sharing program paid 10 to all eligible employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion the profit sharing program for pilots remains unchanged from the prior year and will continue under its current terms 

investing activities 

capital expenditures our capital expenditures were 34 billion in 2016  29 billion in 2015 and 22 billion in 2014  our capital expenditures during 2016 were primarily related to the purchase of b737900er aircraft to replace a portion of our older b757200 aircraft purchases of a321200 and a330300 aircraft advanced deposit payments on future aircraft order commitments and seat density projects for our domestic fleet our capital expenditures during 2015 and 2014 were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and modifications to upgrade aircraft interiors that enhance our product offering 

we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft we expect that we will invest approximately 35 billion in 2017 primarily for a aircraft including deliveries of b737900ers a321200s and a350900s along with advance deposit payments for these and our new a330900neo and cs100 orders as well as for b aircraft modifications the majority of which relate to increasing the seat density and enhancing the cabins on our domestic fleet we expect that the 2017 investments will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations 

equity investments we own 42 of the outstanding shares of grupo aeroméxico and we have derivative contracts that may be settled for shares of grupo aeroméxico  our total derivative contract holdings represent 128 of grupo aeroméxicos shares during 2015 we announced our intention to create an antitrust immunized commercial joint venture with aeroméxico and to acquire additional shares of the capital stock of grupo aeroméxico through a cash tender offer both subject to regulatory approvals the mexican and us regulators approved antitrust immunity for the joint venture during 2016 subject to certain conditions delta and aeroméxico have accepted the conditions and are in the process of implementing the necessary actions in order to satisfy the conditions we expect both the joint venture to be implemented and the tender offer to be completed in the first half of 2017 as a result of the tender offer when combined with our current holdings and derivative positions we would own up to 49 of the outstanding capital stock of grupo aeroméxico the total amount to be paid for the tender offer shares and the shares underlying the derivatives is expected to be up to 765 million  

lax redevelopment during the september 2016 quarter we executed a new lease agreement with los angeles world airports lawa which owns and operates lax and announced plans to modernize upgrade and connect terminals 2 and 3 at lax over the next seven years based on the lease agreement we will design and manage the construction of the initial investment of 350 million to renovate gate areas support space and other amenities for passengers upgrade the baggage handling systems in the terminals and facilitate the relocation of those airlines currently located in terminals 2 and 3 to terminals 5 6 and tom bradley international terminal tbit subject to required approvals we have an option to expand the project which could cost an additional 15 billion and would include 1 redevelopment of terminal 3 and enhancement of terminal 2 2 rebuild of the ticketing arrival hall and security checkpoint 3 construction of infrastructure for the planned airport people mover 4 ramp improvements and 5 construction of a secure connector to the north side of tbit we expect a substantial majority of the project costs will be funded by a quasigovernmental entity 

financing activities 

debt and capital leases the principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from 117 billion at the beginning of 2014 to 74 billion at december 31 2016  since december 31 2009 we have reduced our principal amount of debt and capital leases by 109 billion we have focused on reducing our total debt in recent years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet as a result we received upgrades to our credit ratings by all three major rating agencies including investment grade ratings from moodys and fitch continued improvement in our credit ratings could result in lower costs of borrowing among other benefits 

at december 31 2016 our ratings were 



in connection with the retirement and termination of the outstanding loans under our existing 25 billion senior secured credit financing facilities due april 2016 and april 2017 we completed refinancing transactions in august 2015 with new debt consisting of 20 billion of senior secured credit facilities and 500 million of 20151 pass through certificates the senior secured credit facilities consist of a 15 billion revolving credit facility and a 500 million term loan facility 

capital returns to shareholders since 2013 our board of directors has implemented three programs to return capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013 we have increased the dividend per share by 50 annually and paid 12 billion in total dividends including 509 million in 2016 through dividends and share repurchases we have returned nearly 74 billion to shareholders since 2013 while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 14 compared to the beginning of 2013 during 2016 alone we repurchased and retired 60 million shares at a cost of 26 billion 



on february 10 2017 the board of directors declared a 02025 per share dividend for shareholders of record as of february 24 2017 

fuel hedge restructuring during 2015 we effectively deferred settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2016 by entering into fuel derivative transactions that excluding market movements from the date of inception settled and provided approximately 300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2015 and required approximately 300 million in cash payments in 2016 we early terminated certain of these deferral transactions in 2015 as a result we reported 429 million in cash receipts and 71 million in cash payments associated with these deferral transactions in 2015 

during the march 2016 quarter we entered into transactions to further defer settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2017 these deferral transactions excluding market movements from the date of inception provided approximately 300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2016 and require approximately 300 million in cash payments in 2017 

during the june 2016 quarter we early terminated certain of our outstanding deferral transactions and made cash payments of 170 million including normal settlements as a result during the year ended december 31 2016 we reported 291 million in cash receipts and 451 million in cash payments associated with these transactions for additional information regarding these deferral transactions see note 4 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

undrawn lines of credit 

we have 25 billion available in undrawn revolving lines of credit our credit facilities have covenants including minimum collateral coverage ratios if we are not in compliance with these covenants we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them we currently have a substantial amount of unencumbered assets available to pledge as collateral 

covenants 

we were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at december 31 2016  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2016 that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments representing obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 



  

 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt 

longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using london interbank offered rates libor at december 31 2016  

operating lease payments represents our minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases including certain aircraft flown by regional carriers 

aircraft purchase commitments represents our commitments to purchase 51 b737900er 67 a321200 75 cs100 25 a330900neo 25 a350900 and two a330300 aircraft 

contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with thirdparty regional carriers the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying 

employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our employee benefit obligations see critical accounting policies and estimates 

other obligations represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other thirdparty services and products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles program offers incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta delta connection and airlines that participate in the skymiles program as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines effective january 1 2015 the skymiles program was modified from a model in which customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on distance traveled to a model based on ticket price this award change did not affect the way we account for the program 

the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below these are 1 passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and 2 the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation we value each deliverable on a standalone basis our estimate of the selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers which is reevaluated at least annually we use established ticket prices to determine the estimated selling price of air transportation we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 

we defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales when the credits are earned and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately 50 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of mileage credits customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables as defined below 

our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express in december 2014 we amended our marketing agreements with american express which increased the value we receive under the agreements and extended the term to 2022 the amended agreements became effective january 1 2015 we account for the agreements consistent with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered based on their relative selling prices we determined our best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta and 4 brand value the increased value received under the amended agreements increases the amount of deferred revenue for the travel component and increases the value of the other deliverables which are recognized in other revenue as they are provided 

we recognize revenue as we deliver each sales element we defer the travel deliverable mileage credits as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel the revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables is recorded in other revenue we recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed 

breakage for mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed breakage we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed we use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years at december 31 2016  the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 39 billion  a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 31 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2016  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both market capitalization and projected discounted future cash flows an income approach when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 3 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows 2 terminal period revenue growth and cash flows 3 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 4 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 5 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinitelived to definitelived factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot restrictions or additional open skies agreements 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets 

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances the stabilized operating environment for us airlines has led to improved financial results 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion at december 31 2016  based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 48 billion at december 31 2016  of which 47 billion related to indefinitelived intangible assets indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements 

in 2016  we performed qualitative assessments of our indefinitelived intangible assets other than the pacific routes and slots asset including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors which impact the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets 

we obtained the pacific routes and slots asset as part of the acquisition of northwest airlines in 2008 this intangible asset is composed of pacific route authorities and takeoff and landing rights slots at capacityconstrained airports in asia including tokyonarita airport changes in key inputs and assumptions including 1 new or enhanced joint ventures or alliances 2 legislative or regulatory changes including access to tokyos haneda airport 3 foreign currency exchange rates 4 fuel costs and 5 pacific region profitability could impact the value of this asset in the future we performed a quantitative assessment of our pacific routes and slots indefinitelived intangible asset and determined that there was no indication that the asset was impaired as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 244 billion at december 31 2016  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we review flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired factors which could be indicators of impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals as of december 31 2016  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 106 billion  during 2016  we contributed 13 billion to these plans and recorded 251 million of expense in salaries and related costs on our consolidated statement of operations in 2017 we estimate we will contribute at least 12 billion to these plans including 700 million of contributions above the minimum funding requirements the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on highquality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 420 and 457 at december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 499 to 413 between 2014 and 2016 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity fixed income real assets hedge funds and other assets and instruments our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2016 was 894  

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



life expectancy  changes in life expectancy may significantly change our benefit obligations and future expense we use the society of actuaries soa published mortality data other publicly available information and our own perspective of future longevity to develop our best estimate of life expectancy in 2014 the soa published updated mortality tables for us plans and an updated improvement scale which both reflected significant improvements in longevity since then the soa has published annual updates to their improvement scale each year we consider updates by the soa in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations   

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules alternative funding rules for defined benefit plans that are frozen we elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an 885 discount rate 

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 under this asu and subsequently issued amendments revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer for the amount of consideration received entities may use a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption of the standard is permitted but not before december 15 2016 

we are currently evaluating how the adoption of the revenue recognition standard will impact our consolidated financial statements interpretations are ongoing and could have a significant impact on our implementation while we currently believe the adoption will have little effect on earnings the classification of certain transactions within revenues and between revenues and operating expenses may change also the adoption may increase the rate used to account for frequent flyer miles which would impact the balance of the frequent flyer liability we plan to adopt the standard effective january 1 2018 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 this standard will require all leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 although early adoption is permitted 

we have not completed our assessment but we believe adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets however we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on the recognition measurement or presentation of lease expenses within the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated statements of cash flows information about our undiscounted future lease payments and the timing of those payments is in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial instruments 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 this standard makes several changes including the elimination of the availableforsale classification of equity investments and requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income it is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 

our investments in the parent companies of aeroméxico and gol are currently accounted for as availableforsale with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income at the time of adoption any amounts in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss aoci related to equity investments would be reclassified to retained earnings as of december 31 2016 a net unrealized loss of 38 million related to these investments was recorded in aoci on our consolidated balance sheet 

equity method investments 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201607 investments—equity method and joint ventures topic 323 this standard eliminates the requirement that when an existing cost method investment qualifies for use of the equity method an investor must restate its historical financial statements as if the equity method had been used since the investment was acquired under the new guidance at the point an investment qualifies for the equity method any unrealized gain or loss in aoci will be recognized in nonoperating incomeexpense 

we adopted this standard during the march 2016 quarter although none of our availableforsale or cost investments qualified for use of the equity method during 2016 we expect the tender offer for additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico to be completed in the march 2017 quarter at which point our investment will qualify for the equity method of accounting 

statement of cash flows 

in the second half of 2016 the fasb issued asu nos 201615 and 201618 related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments and the presentation of restricted cash within an entitys statement of cash flows respectively these standards are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 but early adoption is permitted we do not expect these standards to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows

the following table shows our calculation of roic we present roic as management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing our ability to generate returns using its invested capital roic is operating income adjusted divided by adjusted average invested capital we adjust operating income for mtm adjustments and settlements and restructuring and other for the same reasons discussed above for pretax income all adjustments to calculate roic are intended to provide a more meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry and other highquality industrial companies 



 

the following table shows a reconciliation of adjusted net debt we use adjusted total debt including aircraft rent and longterm adjusted debt and capital leases to present estimated financial obligations we reduce adjusted total debt by cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and hedge margin receivable payable resulting in adjusted net debt to present the amount of assets needed to satisfy the debt we believe this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company’s overall debt profile we reduce adjusted total debt by the amount of hedge margin receivable payable which reflects cash posted to received from counterparties as we believe this removes the impact of current market volatility on our unsettled hedges and is a better representation of the continued progress we have made on our debt initiatives

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

changes in aircraft fuel prices materially impact our results of operations we have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel as jet fuel prices are subject to potential volatility during the march 2016 quarter to better participate in the low fuel price environment we entered into derivatives designed to offset and effectively neutralize our existing airline segment hedge positions  as a result we locked in the amount of net hedge settlements for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 during the june 2016 quarter we early settled 455 million of our airline segments 2016 positions we recognized 366 million of fuel hedge losses during the year ended december 31 2016  

for the year ended december 31 2016  aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers accounted for 60 billion  or 183  of our total operating expense based on annual consumption of approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel assuming we do not enter into new derivative contracts we are exposed to changes in the market price of jet fuel a one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately 40 million of additional annual fuel expense 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2016  we had 34 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 37 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 120 million at december 31 2016 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 37 million exclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge contract we have one interest rate hedge contract with a notional value of 349 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2016  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a 27 million asset position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the japanese yen and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 45 million gain or 55 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2017

international alliances 

our international alliance relationships with foreign carriers are an important part of our business as they improve our access to international markets and enable us to market globally integrated air transportation services in general these arrangements include reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access arrangements and with some carriers may also include joint sales and marketing coordination colocation of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements these alliances also may present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements aircraft maintenance insourcing and joint procurement 

joint venture agreements we currently operate three joint ventures with foreign carriers these arrangements for which we have received antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation dot provide for joint commercial cooperation with our partners within the geographic scope of those arrangements including the sharing of revenues andor profits and losses generated by the parties on the joint venture routes as well as joint marketing and sales coordinated pricing and revenue management network planning and scheduling and other coordinated activities with respect to the parties operations on joint venture routes the three joint ventures are

enhanced commercial agreements with foreign carriers we have separate strategic equity investments in grupo aeroméxico sab de cv the parent company of aeroméxico and in gol linhas aéreas inteligentes sa the parent company of vrg linhas aéreas operating as gol and an exclusive commercial relationship with each air carrier we invested in aeroméxico and gol because they operate in latin americas two largest markets mexico and brazil respectively our commercial agreements with each of these carriers separately provide for expansion of reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation airport lounge access arrangements improved passenger connections and joint sales cooperation 

we intend to further expand our relationship with aeroméxico through a joint venture on flights between the us and mexico that will allow us to compete more effectively on these routes we are currently seeking approvals from governmental authorities for this joint venture in addition to our commercial cooperation arrangements for passenger service with aeroméxico we and aeroméxico have established a joint venture relating to an airframe maintenance repair and overhaul operation located in queretaro mexico we have also announced our intention to commence a tender offer for additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico the parent company of aeroméxico that would result in us owning up to 49 of the outstanding shares 

we have also acquired shares of china eastern and entered into a commercial agreement with them to expand our relationship and better connect the networks of the two airlines the expanded commercial agreement is designed to allow the carriers to compete more effectively on routes between the us and china provide more travel options for customers in both countries and make joint investments in the customer experience 

skyteam  in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam global airline alliance the other members of skyteam are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico air europa air france alitalia china airlines china eastern china southern csa czech airlines garuda indonesia kenya airways klm korean air middle east airlines saudi arabian airlines tarom vietnam airlines and xiamen airlines through alliance arrangements with other skyteam carriers delta is able to link its network with the route networks of the other member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer arrangements airport lounge access programs and coordinated cargo operations 

domestic alliances 

we have reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access arrangements with both alaska airlines and hawaiian airlines 

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets approximately 17  of our passenger revenue in 2015 was related to flying by these regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program delta connection we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our “dl” designator code we have contractual arrangements with 

 

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our “dl” designator code we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

skywest airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement this proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

general 

we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

monroe energy 

our whollyowned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively “monroe” operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk these companies are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers 

we own monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our new york operations the us government recently reversed a ban on crude oil exports from the us this policy reversal will place pressure on refiners in the northeastern us the possibility that some refineries in the northeastern us may close reinforces the reasons for monroe to operate the trainer refinery 

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining 195000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined products “nonjet fuel products” monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers 

strategic agreements   monroe exchanges substantially all the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations   

segments  because the products and services of monroes refinery operations are discrete from our airline services segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment   financial information on our segment reporting can be found in note 14  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel hedging program 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and   frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets   we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  

 4 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations however it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel and crude oil weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles ®  frequent flyer program skymiles program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage credit for travel awards by flying on delta its regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits miles do not expire but are subject to the program rules we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs ® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacitycontrolled seating in 2015  program members redeemed more than 312 billion miles in the skymiles program for 133 million award redemptions during this period 72 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect all of the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china cargo airlines china southern cargo czech airlines cargo and korean air cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

delta techops delta global services mlt vacations and delta private jets 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” staffing and other services vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations in 2015  the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 1 billion 

   

 

 

 

distribution and expanded product offerings 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including digital channels such as deltacom and mobile telephone reservations and traditional brick and mortar and online travel agencies an increasing number of our tickets are sold through delta digital channels which reduces our distribution costs and gives us improved and direct personalized interaction with our customers 

 5 

we are transforming distribution to a more retail oriented merchandised approach by introducing welldefined and differentiated products available to our customers we will offer five distinct travel experiences which include premium amenities and services in delta one tm  first class and delta comfort tm  while main cabin and basic economy options allow customers to match the level of service with their preferences we expect that these merchandising initiatives implemented across all of delta’s distribution channels will allow customers to better understand our product offerings make it easier to buy the products they desire and increase customer satisfaction this merchandising effort is best experienced on delta’s digital channels where customers can compare all product options in a single easy to understand display

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs the industry is going through a period of transformation through consolidation both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is increasing from government owned and funded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and southeast asia are government subsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have altered competition in international markets 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

 7 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia jfk and newark in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

emissions  the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date the icao has adopted two additional aircraft engine emissions standards the first of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 and the second of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2013 in june 2012 the epa published a final rulemaking for new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen nox adopting icaos additional standards included in the rule are two new tiers of more stringent emission standards for nox   these standards referred to as the tier 6 standards became effective for newlymanufactured aircraft engines beginning in 2013 

concern about aviation environmental issues including climate change and greenhouse gases has led to taxes on our operations in the united kingdom and in germany both of which have levied taxes directly on our customers we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions this could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations ongoing bilateral discussions between the us and other nations may lead to international treaties or other actions focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation in addition at the 38 th  icao assembly that concluded october 4 2013 in montreal the assembly adopted a climate change resolution committing icao to develop a global marketbased measure to be finalized at the 2016 icao assembly which would enable the airline industry to achieve carbonneutral growth by 2020 

the european union has required its member states to implement regulations including aviation in its emissions trading scheme “ets” under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the ets has been amended to apply only to flights within the european economic area from 2013 through 2016 as a result we operate a limited number of flights that will be subject to the ets through 2016 after 2016 the ets would apply to all flights originating or landing in the european union unless the eu amends the current legislation following the 2016 icao assembly 

  

cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the us in addition other legislative or regulatory action including by the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible in particular the epa has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and further determined that aircraft cause or contribute greenhouse gases which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the us or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the european union where we operate or where we  may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

 8 

we seek to minimize the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our greenhouse gas emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement of older less fuel efficient aircraft and replacement with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national  air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and  greenhouse gas emissions 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted renewable fuel standards “rfs” that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel “transportation fuels” renewable identification numbers “rins” are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa 

other environmental matters  we are subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and aircraft drinking water we are specifically aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2016 the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in self help self help includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 83000  fulltime equivalent employees approximately 18  of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



 

in addition 209  refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2019 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act  nlra  which generally allows either party to engage in self help upon the expiration of the agreement 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors   

risk factors relating to delta 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

potential terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of such events may reduce demand for air travel and cause increases in costs and declines in revenue the attacks of september 11 2001 and the aftermath materially impacted the business financial condition and operating results of our company as it did for the rest of the airline industry despite significantly heightened security measures at airports and airlines the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups terrorist activity such as the attacks in paris in november 2015 generally can also impact our industry by discouraging air travel we constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals including from violent extremists in the us both with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry in addition the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant security events whether from external or internal sources also pose a significant risk to our operations 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security events or fear of such events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying and requiring changes in our operations for example heightened terrorist activity or geopolitical conflict may discourage air travel and reduce ticket purchases in addition to losing revenue from decreased ticket sales and increased refunds potential costs include increased security costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring reputational harm and other costs if any or all of these types of events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel over the last decade fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile during the last several years in 2015  our average fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges was 190  a 452  decrease from our average fuel price in 2014  in 2014  our average fuel price per gallon was 347  a 157  increase from our average fuel price in 2013  in 2013  our average fuel price per gallon was 300  which was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 230  354  and 333  of our operating expense in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry at times in the past we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future this is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our whollyowned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

our fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel the effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and marktomarket adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  in addition we record marktomarket adjustments “mtm adjustments” on our fuel hedges mtm adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods losses from rebalancing or mtm adjustments or both may have a negative impact on our financial results 

 12 

our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may require us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

under a strategic agreement that monroe has with a significant counterparty monroe is exchanging nonjet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of nonjet fuel products to the counterparty and the counterparty is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us if either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement if the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations 

in addition the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged if monroes cost of producing the nonjet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers we expect to continue exploring similar noncontrolling investments in and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these transactions and relationships involve significant challenges and risks including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

in addition we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers we do not have control over their operations or business methods we may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 13 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a negative public perception about safety which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures these changes could result from factors that are not under our control a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where it may be difficult to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our   operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2015  approximately 18  of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the nlra which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub gateway or key airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub gateway or key airports in amsterdam boston detroit londonheathrow los angeles minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city seattle and tokyonarita each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other delta hubs and gateways a significant extended interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or gateways could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 14 

breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

as a regular part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data the compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business 

disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations possibly having a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend such as power telecommunications or the internet the operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers and other security issues a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our network including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our customer service and result in increased costs while we have in place and continue to invest in initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

failure of our technology to perform reliably could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to enhance customer service reduce costs and increase operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in deltacom mobile device applications checkin kiosks and related initiatives including security for these initiatives the performance reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively if our technology does not perform reliably our business and operations could be negatively affected 

our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year

an extended disruption in services provided by our thirdparty regional   carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including thirdparty carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations in particular some thirdparty regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines if this shortage becomes more widespread thirdparty regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us to the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

in particular under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have been volatile marked by periods of sharp increases we cannot predict the future prices of rins purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroes products could limit the refinerys production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management personnel and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market as a result we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is increasing from governmentowned and funded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the united states from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and southeast asia are governmentsubsidized which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory 

increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

 17 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast us have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the us while enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until april 2017 we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the european union if fully implemented other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies are reviewing airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally with almost 35 of our revenues from operations outside of the us our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness or fear of such an event can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

  

in 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed against delta and airtran airways “airtran” alleging that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtrans ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag deltas imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtrans imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the first bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings and remain pending in the northern district of georgia a motion for class certification has been filed but no class has been certified to date delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits the defendants motions for summary judgment are also pending 

capacity antitrust litigation 

in july 2015 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed alleging that delta american united and southwest had conspired to restrain capacity the lawsuits were filed in the wake of media reports that the us department of justice had served civil investigative demands upon these carriers seeking documents and information relating to this subject the lawsuits have been consolidated into a single multidistrict litigation proceeding in the us district court for the district of columbia delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results   of operations 

financial highlights  2015  compared to 2014   

our pretax income for 2015  was 72 billion  representing a 61 billion  increase compared to the prior year predominantly as a result of lower fuel prices and strong nonfuel cost controls pretax income adjusted for special items a nongaap financial measure increased 13 billion or 293 to 59 billion  special items in 2015 were primarily related to fuel hedge mtm adjustments and settlements which totaled 13 billion 

revenue  our operating revenue increased   342 million  compared to the prior year primarily resulting from our branded fares initiative and our agreement with american express passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm decreased 33  on 30  higher capacity the decrease in prasm was largely driven by competitive pressure in the current low fuel price environment and the impact of us dollar strength on tickets sold in international markets which are predominantly priced in local currency 

operating expense  total operating expense decreased   53 billion  from 2014  driven by lower fuel prices partially offset by fuel hedge losses higher salaries and related costs and profit sharing during 2015 brent crude oil averaged 52 per barrel and closed the year below 40 per barrel which is significantly lower than the average of 99 per barrel during 2014 salaries and related costs were higher as a result of increases in pilot and flight attendant block hours due to higher capacity and pay rate increases implemented in 2015 

our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile casm for 2015  decreased 163  to 1333 cent s from 1592 cent s in 2014  on a 30  increase in capacity primarily due to lower fuel prices nonfuel unit costs casmex a nongaap financial measure were flat in 2015  compared to 2014  at 917 cent s due to strong nonfuel cost controls and the strength of the us dollar our 2015 unit cost performance was inline with our goal of limiting nonfuel unit cost growth to below 2 annually 

the nongaap financial measures for pretax income adjusted for special items and casmex used in this section and return on invested capital roic and adjusted net debt used in the section below are defined and reconciled in supplemental information below 

company initiatives 

running a reliable customerfocused airline has produced a higher roic a nongaap financial measure which increased from 207 in 2014 to 283 in 2015 this improved financial performance has allowed us to improve our balance sheet by reducing adjusted net debt a nongaap financial measure to 67 billion increase funding of our defined benefit pension plans and increase the amount of capital returned to our shareholders we are focused on delivering additional value for shareholders in the future through revenue growth cost productivity and prudent deployment of cash flows 

driving revenue growth 

operational reliability 

a key driver of our revenue growth is higher customer satisfaction resulting from strong operational reliability we have significantly invested in our business since 2010 to improve our operational performance which consistently ranks first among the major us carriers during 2015 we operated 161 days with zero mainline canceled flights a 69 improvement over our 2014 performance in addition our reported completion factor of 996 and ontime arrival rate of 859 places us at the top among the major global us carriers this operational excellence resulted in a four point increase in our domestic net promoter score compared to 2014 accordingly our corporate ticket volume increased 4 in 2015 reflecting our reliable service and highquality product 

global strategy 

we are expanding our global network under this strategy we are strengthening our presence in major and developing markets around the world in an effort to increase and diversify our network into high revenue and high growth markets the growth of our global presence will enable customers to seamlessly connect to more places while enjoying a consistent highquality travel experience we are deploying this strategy through investments in europe asia and latin america 

 26 

europe  alongside our 49 equity investment in virgin atlantic we implemented an antitrust immunized joint venture with the ukbased carrier this joint venture has significantly improved our presence in london one of the largest revenue markets from the us while also enhancing our transatlantic network including our existing joint venture relationship with air franceklm and alitalia we have also moved senior decisionmaking functions to amsterdam for closer coordination with our joint venture airlines we anticipate the colocation of these management functions will optimize the benefits of our joint ventures 

asia  as part of the strategy to improve our pacific operations we are increasing our presence in china the largest transpacific market from the us to this end during 2015 we acquired shares of china eastern for 450 million which provides us with a 35 stake in the airline in conjunction with this transaction we and china eastern entered into a new commercial agreement to expand our relationship and better connect the networks of the two airlines china eastern is one of the largest airlines in china with a route network covering more than 200 destinations in over 25 countries in addition we are restructuring our pacific fleet by removing less efficient b747400 aircraft and replacing them with smallergauge widebody aircraft to better match capacity with demand in an effort to improve our margins 

latin america  we are focused on maximizing the value of our relationships while deriving value from the recent investments in our network product and service our capacity growth has been focused on higher performing markets such as mexico and the caribbean while we have reduced capacity in markets challenged by weakening currencies and slowing economies such as brazil 

during the december 2015 quarter we announced a plan to acquire additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico through a cash tender offer following the completion of the tender offer when combined with our existing share ownership we expect to own up to 49 of grupo aeroméxicos outstanding shares  we have submitted an application for an antitrust immunized joint venture with aeroméxico which we expect will be approved in 2016 and is intended to allow us to benefit from an improved level of coordination 

also during 2015 we acquired additional preferred shares of gols parent company for 50 million increasing our ownership to 95 of its outstanding capital stock as part of our longterm strategy to strengthen the opportunity we see in brazil in conjunction with our investment we and gol agreed to extend our existing commercial agreements 

cost productivity 

we continue to focus on maintaining the rate of nonfuel unit cost growth at less than 2 annually an important component of this effort relates to maximizing the benefits of scale throughout the network domestic fleet upgauging allows us to increase capacity on fewer departures thereby improving our unit cost performance in addition we are leveraging our expertise in supply chain and aircraft maintenance to improve our productivity finally we are investing in technology projects to improve the customer experience in a costefficient manner 

the delta pilots collective bargaining agreement became amendable as of december 31 2015 we are in discussions with representatives of the delta pilots to amend the collective bargaining agreement our employees including pilots are an important part of delta’s success and the underpinning of the quality and operational reliability that has become part of delta’s brand we expect to continue to pay our employees industry leading total compensation that will enable delta’s continued success 

prudent deployment of cash flows 

as part of our longterm plan we target 78 billion in annual operating cash flow and 45 billion in annual free cash flow we use approximately 50 of our operating cash flow to reinvest in the business for longterm growth opportunities the remaining free cash flow is used to further strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt levels make incremental pension contributions and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

strengthened balance sheet 

a key tenet of our strategy is to operate the company with investment grade financial metrics since beginning our balance sheet improvement strategy in 2009 we have reduced our adjusted net debt by over 10 billion which has significantly reduced our annual interest expense in addition we have a significant net underfunded pension liability we have been making pension contributions above the minimum amount required with a goal of achieving 80 funded status for the pension plan by 2020 b ecause of statutory pension funding relief that applies to us we have until 2031 to fully fund our pension plans   

 27 

increased capital returns to owners 

while we have been reducing our debt levels and investing in the business we have been increasing our capital returns to shareholders returning a total of 26 billion in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013 we have increased the dividend per share by 50 annually and paid 712 million in total dividends including 359 million in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases we have returned over 4 billion to shareholders since 2013 while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 9 compared to the beginning of 2013

results of operations  2015  compared to 2014   

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue decreased   172 million  over the prior year prasm decreased   33  and passenger mile yield decreased   37  on 30   higher  capacity load factor was 02 points   higher  than the prior year at 849  

unit revenues of the mainline domestic region decreased 06  resulting from weaker yields in certain markets which were nearly offset by the strong performance in atlanta new york seattle and los angeles 

regional carriers passenger revenue decreased 61  on a 40  reduction in capacity during 2015 we removed thirty  50seat regional aircraft as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet 

revenues related to our international regions decreased   60 yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of the strong us dollar and reductions in international fuel surcharges these challenges have been addressed through capacity reductions implemented in the december 2015 quarter 

in the atlantic region unit revenue declines in africa the middle east and russia were partially offset by strength in core european markets unit revenue declines in the pacific primarily resulted from the strength of the us dollar and lower international fuel surcharges we continue to optimize the pacific region in order to improve margins by reducing our winter capacity including the cancellation of our seattle to tokyohaneda route in the june 2015 quarter and downgauging via the continued retirement of the b747400 fleet during the second half of 2015 in addition we have made a strategic investment in and established a longterm commercial relationship with china eastern latin america saw capacity growth of 57  the majority of which occurred during the first half of 2015 in the december 2015 quarter we continued to invest in higher performing markets such as mexico and the caribbean while reducing capacity in brazil due to its challenging economic environment 

other revenue other revenue increased 635 million  or 142  primarily due to loyalty program revenues including our agreement with american express sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery and maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business 

 29 

operating expense 



 

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to higher pilot and flight attendant block hours and pay rate increases implemented in both the first half of 2015 and december 2015 base pay rates increased 145 for eligible merit ground and flight attendant employees effective december 1 2015 

aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers fuel expense decreased 59 billion  compared to the prior year due to a 435 decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel an increase in monroes profitability and reduced hedge losses partially offset by a 24  increase in consumption the table below presents fuel expense including our regional carriers 



 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted nongaap financial measures 



  30 

regional carriers expense the reduction in regional carriers expense is primarily due to lower fuel cost from a decrease in the price per gallon of fuel lower capacity and reduced maintenance expenses during 2015 we removed t hirty  50seat regional aircraft as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet 

contracted services  the increase in contracted services expense predominantly related to costs associated with the 30  increase in capacity and additional temporary staffing 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to investments in new a330300 b737900er and crj900 aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering 

landing fees and other rents landing fees and other rents increased principally due to increased number of departures and higher rental rates 

profit sharing  the increase in profit sharing is driven by an increase in full year pretax income compared to the prior year our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items for years prior to 2016 our profit sharing program paid 10 to employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion   

beginning with 2016 pretax profit to be paid out in 2017 the profit sharing formula will be adjusted to pay 10 of annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program and if we exceed our prioryear results the program will pay 20 of the yearoveryear increase in pretax profit to eligible employees the profit sharing program for pilots remains unchanged and will continue in 2016 under its terms   

passenger service passenger service expense includes the costs for onboard food and beverage cleaning and supplies this expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to costs associated with enhancements to our onboard product offering and the 33  increase in traffic 

other  other operating expense increased primarily due to costs associated with sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery 

 31 

results of operations  2014  compared to 2013   

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue increased 20 billion or 61 over prior year prasm increased 30 and passenger mile yield increased 20 on 30 higher capacity load factor was 09 points higher than prior year at 847 

our geographic regions generally performed well compared to the prior year with the domestic region leading yearoveryear unit revenue improvement unit revenues of the domestic region rose 52  led by strong performances from our hubs in atlanta new yorklaguardia and seattle 

revenues related to our international regions increased 30 yearoveryear primarily due to 177 capacity growth in the latin america region as a result of our efforts to improve connections with gol and aeroméxico gol and aeroméxico contributed a significant portion of the traffic from the us to brazil and into key mexico markets respectively despite these contributions latin america unit revenues declined 25 as a result of the capacity increase some business demand weakness associated with the fifa world cup in brazil and economic concerns in venezuela atlantic unit revenue increased 21 driven by yield improvements while our joint venture with virgin atlantic reflected solid revenue growth especially in londonheathrow atlantic yields experienced pressure from the impact of geopolitical and health concerns related to service to africa the middle east and russia our pacific region experienced a 38 decline in unit revenues driven by lower yield primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen 

other revenue other revenue increased 580 million or 149 primarily due to an increase in sales of skymiles settlements associated with our transatlantic joint venture agreements and sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery 

 32 

operating expense 



 

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to investments in our employees and an increase in pilot and flight attendant block hours partially offset by lower pension expense 

fuel expense compared to the prior year consolidated fuel expense increased 20 billion  due to unfavorable mtm adjustments on fuel hedges resulting from the significant decrease in crude oil prices during the year from a high of 115 per barrel in june to a low of 57 per barrel at december 31 2014 and a 17  increase in consumption partially offset by a 78 decrease in fuel market price per gallon and increased profitability at monroe the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per gallon including the impact of hedging and the refinery 



  

 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted 



  

  33 

regional carriers expense the reduction in regional carriers expense is primarily due to lower fuel expense from both a decrease in the cost of fuel per gallon and a 38 decrease in capacity and fewer required maintenance events during 2014 we removed thirtyfive 50seat regional aircraft from our fleet as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and costs associated with maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business the reduction in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs is due primarily to lower engine maintenance volume and a contract settlement charge in 2013 partially offset by a higher volume of cost of sales from our mro business 

contracted services contracted services expense increased yearoveryear due primarily to costs associated with the 30 increase in capacity 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to our investment in new b737900er and crj900 aircraft the purchase of aircraft offlease and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering 

passenger commissions and other selling expenses passenger commissions and other selling expenses increased on higher passenger revenue 

profit sharing  the increase in profit sharing is driven by an increase in full year pretax income excluding profit sharing and certain other items compared to the prior year 

aircraft rent aircraft rent increased yearoveryear due primarily to the addition of leased b717200 and b737900er aircraft delivered during the year partially offset by the retirement of certain b747400 aircraft 

other  other operating expense increased primarily due to costs associated with sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery

the decline in interest expense net results from reduced levels of debt and unamortized debt discounts and from the refinancing of debt obligations at lower interest rates the principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from 132 billion at the beginning of 2013 to 85 billion at   december 31 2015  

miscellaneous net is favorable primarily due to a reduction in debt extinguishment losses compared to 2014 the debt extinguishment losses primarily related to unamortized debt discounts resulting from fair value adjustments recorded in the 2008 purchase accounting of northwest airlines we did not early extinguish any debt in 2013 also contributing to the increase is our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investment in virgin atlantic the gain from virgin atlantic primarily results from yearoveryear profit and improvements in mtm adjustments on fuel hedges 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2015 was 368  we expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 35 and 36 for 2016 the expected reduction in our rate from prior years is primarily related to differences in our global tax rates in certain periods we may have adjustments to our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in prior year estimates and tax laws enacted during the period which will impact the effective tax rate for that period at december 31 2015  we had approximately 95 billion  of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards which do not begin to expire until 2024  accordingly we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes before 2018 see note 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

we released substantially all of our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets on december 31 2013 the release of the allowance primarily resulted in a net tax benefit of 80 billion that was recorded in income tax provision benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 

refinery segment 

the refinery primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel monroe exchanges substantially all the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations  the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 171000 barrels approximately seven million gallons per day for use in our airline operations during 2015  we believe that the increase in jet fuel supply due to the refinerys operation has reduced the overall market price of jet fuel and thus lowered our cost of jet fuel 

a refinery is subject to annual epa requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa we recognized 75 million 111 million and 64 million of expense related to the rins requirement in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we are in possession of the rins needed to satisfy our 2013 obligation and a portion of our 2014 and 2015 obligations 

the refinery recorded a profit of 290 million  in 2015  compared to 96 million  in 2014 and a loss of 116 million  recorded in 2013 the refinerys profitability improved yearoveryear despite lower revenues resulting from a decline in refined fuel market prices the refinery’s increase in profits was attributable to higher product crack spreads and higher throughput as a result of enhanced operational reliability logistical improvements and utilization of intermediates partially refined fuels for more information regarding the refinery’s results see note 14  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2015  we had 56 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 34 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 22 billion  in undrawn revolving credit facilities during 2015  we generated 79 billion  in cash from operating activities which we used to fund capital expenditures of 29 billion  return 26 billion to shareholders reduce the principal on our debt and capital lease obligations by 15 billion and fund equity investments of 500 million  while maintaining a solid liquidity position 

sources of liquidity 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated positive cash flows from operations of 79 billion  in 2015  49 billion  in 2014  and 45 billion  in 2013  we also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2016  

our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months 

fuel and fuel hedge margins  including our regional carriers fuel expense represented 230  of our total operating expenses for 2015  the market price for jet fuel is highly volatile which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations from period to period 

as part of our fuel hedging program we may be required to post margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position conversely if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position we may receive margin our future cash flows are impacted by the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying those derivative contracts our hedge contracts were in a net loss position at december 31 2015  and 2014 resulting in 119 million  and 925 million respectively of margin postings to counterparties 

timing of skymiles sales  in december 2011 we amended our american express agreements and agreed to sell 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles to american express in each december from 2011 through 2014 pursuant to the december 2011 amendment american express purchased 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles in each of those years with the final payment in 2014 the skymiles purchased in december 2014 were utilized by american express in 2015 there were no advanced sales of skymiles in 2015 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the pension protection act of 2006 in 2015 we contributed 12 billion  to our qualified defined benefit pension plans  as a result of these contributions we satisfied on an accelerated basis our 2015 required contributions for our defined benefit plans including nearly 600 million above the minimum funding requirements we contributed 917 million  and 914 million in 2014  and 2013 respectively including 250 million above the minimum funding levels in each of those years we estimate our funding under these plans will total at least 10 billion  in 2016  including 500 million  above the minimum funding requirements 

profit sharing our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items for years prior to 2016 our profit sharing program paid 10 to employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion 

 36 

we made profit sharing payments of 756 million 821 million and 372 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in recognition of our employees contributions toward meeting our financial goals during the year ended december 2015 we recorded 15 billion  in profit sharing expense based on 2015 pretax profit which will be paid to employees in february 2016 

beginning with 2016 pretax profit to be paid out in 2017 the profit sharing formula will be adjusted to pay 10 of annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program and if we exceed our prioryear results the program will pay 20 of the yearoveryear increase in pretax profit to eligible employees the profit sharing program for pilots remains unchanged and will continue in 2016 under its terms   

investing activities   

capital expenditures our capital expenditures were 29 billion  in 2015  22 billion in 2014  and 25 billion in 2013  our capital expenditures during 2015 were primarily related to the purchase of b737900er aircraft to replace a portion of our older b757200 aircraft purchases of a330300 aircraft advance deposit payments on a321200 aircraft and seat density projects for our domestic fleet our capital expenditures during 2014 and 2013 were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and modifications to upgrade aircraft interiors that enhance our product offering 

we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft we expect that we will invest approximately 3 billion in 2016 primarily for 1 aircraft including deliveries of b737900ers a321200s and a330300s along with advance deposit payments for these and our new a330900neo and a350900 orders and used e190100 orders as well as for 2 aircraft modifications the majority of which relate to increasing the seat density and enhancing the cabins on our domestic fleet we expect that the 2016 investments will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations 

equity investments our equity investments during 2015 were comprised of 450 million for china eastern shares and 50 million for preferred shares in gols parent company for additional information regarding these investments see note 3  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

during the december 2015 quarter we announced a plan to acquire additional capital stock of grupo aeroméxico through a cash tender offer following the completion of the tender offer when combined with our existing share ownership we expect to own up to 49 of grupo aeroméxicos outstanding shares  this approximately 750 million capital investment is subject to regulatory approvals and the tender offer would likely commence in the june 2016 quarter 

financing activities 

debt and capital leases the principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from 132 billion at the beginning of 2013 to 85 billion at   december 31 2015  since december 31 2009 we have reduced our principal amount of debt and capital leases by 98 billion these debt reductions also serve to reduce our total future interest expense we have focused on reducing our total debt in recent years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet as a result we received upgrades to our credit rating by all three major rating agencies during 2015 to the following ratings 



continued improvement in our credit ratings to investment grade would likely result in lower costs of borrowing among other things 

in connection with the retirement and termination of the outstanding loans under our existing 25 billion senior secured credit financing facilities due april 2016 and april 2017 we completed refinancing transactions in august 2015 with new debt consisting of the senior secured credit facilities 20 billion and the 20151 eetc 500 million the senior secured credit facilities consist of a 15 billion revolving credit facility and a 500 million term loan facility 

 37 

capital returns to shareholders since 2013 our board of directors has implemented three programs to return capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013 we have increased the dividend per share by 50 annually and paid 712 million in total dividends including 359 million in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases we have returned over 4 billion to shareholders since 2013 while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 9 compared to the beginning of 2013  during 2015 alone we repurchased and retired 484 million shares at a cost of 22 billion 



on february 3 2016 the board of directors declared a 0135 per share dividend for shareholders of record as of february 17 2016 

fuel hedge restructuring during 2015 we effectively deferred settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2016 by entering into fuel derivative transactions that excluding market movements from the date of inception would settle and provide approximately 300 million  in cash receipts during the second half of 2015 and require approximately 300 million  in cash payments in 2016  we early terminated certain of these deferral transactions in 2015 as a result we reported 429 million  in cash receipts and 71 million  in cash payments associated with these deferral transactions  

undrawn lines of credit 

we have 22 billion  available in undrawn revolving lines of credit our credit facilities have covenants including minimum collateral coverage ratios if we are not in compliance with these covenants we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them we currently have a substantial amount of unencumbered assets available to pledge as collateral 

covenants 

 we were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at december 31 2015  

 38 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015  that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments representing obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 



  

 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt 

longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using london interbank offered rates libor at december 31 2015  

operating lease payments represents our minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases including certain aircraft flown by regional carriers 

aircraft purchase commitments represents our commitments to purchase 70  b737900er 45  a321200 25  a330900neo 25  a350900 19  e190100 18  b7878 and six  a330300 aircraft our purchase commitment for the   18   b7878 aircraft provides for certain aircraft substitution rights including for our current orders of b737900er aircraft 

contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with thirdparty regional carriers the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying 

employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our employee benefit obligations see “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

other obligations represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other thirdparty services and products 

 39 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles program offers incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta delta connection and airlines that participate in the skymiles program as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines effective january 1 2015 the skymiles program was modified from a model in which customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on distance traveled to a model based on ticket price this award change did not affect the way we account for the program   

the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below these are 1 passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and 2 the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with two deliverables 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation   we value each deliverable on a standalone basis our estimate of the selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers which is reevaluated at least annually we use established ticket prices to determine the estimated selling price of air transportation we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 

we defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales when the credits are earned and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused  a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately 48 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of mileage credits   customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables as defined below 

our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express in december 2014 we amended our marketing agreements with american express which increased the value we receive under the agreements and extended the term to 2022 the amended agreements became effective january 1 2015 the deliverables under the amended agreements are substantially similar to the previous agreement we account for the amended agreements consistent with the accounting method adopted in september 2013 that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered based on their relative selling prices discussed below the increased value received under the amended agreements increases the amount of deferred revenue for the travel component and increases the value of the other deliverables which are recognized in other revenue as they are provided   

in september 2013 we modified our marketing agreements with american express which required us to change the accounting method for recording skymiles sold under the previous method the embedded premium or discount was allocated to the residual products or services in a combined transaction the new method allocates consideration received based on the relative selling price of each product or service we determined our best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees discounted access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta and 4 brand value the impact of adopting the relative selling price method reallocated a portion of the embedded discount to the travel component lowering the deferral rate we use to record miles sold under the agreements and increasing revenue recognized on the remaining deliverables   

 40 

we recognize revenue as we deliver each sales element we defer the travel deliverable mileage credits as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel the revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables is recorded in other revenue we recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed   

breakage for mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed management uses statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years  at december 31 2015  the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 39 billion  a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 29 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2015  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below if the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both market capitalization and projected discounted future cash flows an income approach  when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 3 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions  the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows 2 terminal period revenue growth and cash flows 3 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 4 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 5 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot restrictions or additional open skies agreements 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets   

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances the stabilizing operating environment for us airlines has resulted in annual yields increasing along with load factors leading to improved financial results 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion  at december 31 2015  based upon our quantitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above we determined that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore there was no indication that goodwill was impaired 

 41 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 49 billion  at december 31 2015  of which 47 billion  related to indefinitelived intangible assets  indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements 

in 2015  we performed quantitative assessments including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above of our indefinitelived intangible assets excluding six londonheathrow slot pairs we acquired for 276 million during the december 2015 quarter and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired as the fair values ranged from approximately 130 to 280 of the carrying values 

we obtained the pacific routes and slots asset as part of the acquisition of northwest airlines in 2008 and is composed of pacific route authorities and takeoff and landing rights “slots” at capacityconstrained airports in asia including tokyonarita international airport narita this intangible asset supports delta’s narita hub activities and is essential to deltas entire pacific network changes in key inputs and assumptions including 1 new or enhanced joint ventures or alliances 2 foreign currency exchange rates 3 fuel costs legislative or regulatory changes including changes in access to tokyohaneda airport and 4 pacific region profitability could impact the value of this asset in the future 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 230 billion  at december 31 2015  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we record impairment losses on flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

income tax valuation allowance 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets we establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things projected future taxable income scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results and tax planning strategies  in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred income tax assets the significant factors that we consider include 1 our recent history of profitability 2 growth in the us and global economies 3 forecast of airline revenue trends 4 estimate of future fuel prices and 5 future impact of taxable temporary differences 

we recorded a full valuation allowance in 2004 due to our cumulative loss position at that time during 2013 after considering all positive and negative evidence we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized accordingly we released substantially all of the valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets we recognized an 80 billion  benefit in our provision for income taxes primarily related to the valuation allowance release 

at the end of 2015  our net deferred tax asset balance was 50 billion  against which we maintained a 56 million  valuation allowance  primarily related to state net operating losses state credits and unrealized losses on investments which have limited expiration periods   

 42 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals  as of december 31 2015  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 112 billion  during 2015  we contributed 12 billion  to these plans and recorded 240 million  of expense in salaries and related costs on our consolidated statement of operations in 2016 we estimate we will contribute at least 10 billion  to these plans including 500 million  of contributions above the minimum funding requirements and that our expense will be approximately 250 million the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on highquality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 457  and 414  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 410  to 499  between 2013 and 2015 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data   modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets   we review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually   our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation   the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity fixed income real assets hedge funds and other assets and instruments   our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended   december 31 2015  was 9  

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



life expectancy  we have historically utilized the society of actuaries soa published mortality data in developing a best estimate of life expectancy during 2014 the soa published updated mortality tables for us plans and an updated improvement scale which both reflect improved longevity based on an evaluation of these new tables and our perspective of future longevity we updated the mortality assumptions in 2014 for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations  the improvement in life expectancy increases our benefit obligations and future expense as benefit payments are paid over an extended period of time   in 2015 we reviewed the mortality assumptions and concluded that the assumptions used in 2014 continue to represent our best estimate of longterm life expectancy we will continue to review our assumptions on an annual basis 

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen delta elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an   885   discount rate  in addition b ecause of statutory pension funding relief that applies to us we have until 2031 to fully fund our pension plans 

 43 

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 9  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards 

revenue from contracts with customers   

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers under the new standard revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer for the amount of consideration received for that specific good or service entities may use a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption 

in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date that deferred the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date the fasb permitted early adoption of the standard but not before the original effective date of december 15 2016 we are currently evaluating how the adoption of this standard will impact our consolidated financial statements 

presentation of debt issuance costs 

during 2015 the fasb issued asu nos 201503 and 201515 related to simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs these standards amend existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred charge it is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 but early adoption is permitted we early adopted these standards in the december 2015 quarter which we accounted for as a change in accounting principle and applied the guidance retrospectively this change results in a reclassification of 32 million from prepaid expenses and other to current maturities of longterm debt and capital leases and 84 million from other noncurrent assets to longterm debt and capital leases as of december 31 2014   

disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share 

in may 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201507 disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent under the new standard investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share or its equivalent using the practical expedient will no longer be categorized in the fair value hierarchy it is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 but early adoption is permitted we will adopt this standard effective january 1 2016 we are currently assessing how the adoption of this standard will impact our consolidated financial statements as our pension plan has a significant number of investments measured at net asset value   

balance sheet classification of deferred taxes   

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet it is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 but early adoption is permitted we early adopted this standard in the december 2015 quarter which we accounted for as a change in accounting principle and applied the guidance retrospectively this change results in the reclassification of 33 billion   from current assets to deferred income taxes net in other assets on our december 31 2014 consolidated balance sheet

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201601 financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 this standard makes several modifications to subtopic 82510 including the elimination of the availableforsale classification of equity investments and requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income it is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017

our investments in the parent companies of aeroméxico and gol are currently accounted for as availableforsale with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income at the time of adoption any amounts in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss aoci related to equity investments would be reclassified to nonoperating expenseincome as of december 31 2015 a net unrealized loss of 66 million related to these investments was recorded in aoci on our consolidated balance sheet

the following table shows a reconciliation of roic we present roic as management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing our ability to generate returns using its invested capital roic is operating income adjusted divided by adjusted average invested capital we adjust operating income for mtm adjustments and settlements and restructuring and other for the same reasons discussed above for pretax income all adjustments to calculate roic are intended to provide a more meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry and other highquality industrial companies 



 

the following table shows a reconciliation of adjusted net debt we use adjusted total debt including aircraft rent in addition to longterm adjusted debt and capital leases to present estimated financial obligations we reduce adjusted debt by cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and hedge margin receivable resulting in adjusted net debt to present the amount of assets needed to satisfy the debt management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company’s overall debt profile management has reduced adjusted debt by the amount of hedge margin receivable which reflects cash posted to counterparties as we believe this removes the impact of current market volatility on our unsettled hedges and is a better representation of the continued progress we have made on our debt initiatives

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

changes in aircraft fuel prices materially impact our results of operations   we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and   frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets   we closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  

our fuel hedge portfolio consists of options swaps and futures the hedge contracts include crude oil diesel fuel and jet fuel as these commodities are highly correlated with the price of jet fuel that we consume our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices change significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin we may adjust our hedge portfolio from time to time in response to margin posting requirements 

for the year ended   december 31 2015  aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers accounted for 76 billion  or 230  of our total operating expense we recognized 741 million  of fuel hedge losses during the year ended december 31 2015  due to unfavorable mtm adjustments 

during the december 2015 quarter we entered into hedges designed to offset and effectively terminate our existing hedge positions for the march 2016 quarter in january 2016 we continued this process for substantially all of our positions with contract settlement dates through december 31 2016 as a result we have both neutralized our hedge portfolio and locked in cash payments of approximately   725 million  in 2016 

the following table shows the projected cash impact to fuel cost assuming 20 and 40 increases or decreases in fuel prices for the period from february 1 2016 to december 31 2016 as a result of effectively terminating our hedge positions as discussed above the impact of our hedge portfolio due to changes in fuel prices during 2016 is not significant

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2015  we had 40 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 41 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 160 million at december 31 2015  and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 39 million exclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge contract we have one interest rate hedge contract with a notional value of 384 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2015  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a 94 million  asset position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the japanese yen and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 38 million gain or 46 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2016

international alliances 

our international alliance relationships with foreign carriers are an important part of our business as they improve our access to international markets and enable us to market expanded and globally integrated air transportation services in general these arrangements include reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access arrangements and with some carriers may also include joint sales and marketing coordination colocation of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements these alliances also may present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements aircraft maintenance insourcing and joint procurement 

joint venture agreements we currently operate three joint ventures with foreign carriers these arrangements for which we have received antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation dot provide for joint commercial cooperation with our partners within the geographic scope of those arrangements including the sharing of revenues andor profits and losses generated by the parties on the joint venture routes as well as joint marketing and sales coordinated pricing and revenue management network planning and scheduling and other coordinated activities with respect to the parties operations on joint venture routes the three joint ventures are

skyteam  in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam global airline alliance the other members of skyteam are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico air europa air france alitalia china airlines china eastern china southern csa czech airlines garuda indonesia kenya airways klm korean air middle east airlines saudi arabian airlines tarom vietnam airlines and xiamen airlines through alliance arrangements with other skyteam carriers delta is able to link its network with the route networks of the other member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer arrangements airport lounge access programs and coordinated cargo operations 

domestic alliances 

we have reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access arrangements with both alaska airlines and hawaiian airlines 

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets approximately 18  of our passenger revenue in 2014 was related to flying by these regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program delta connection we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our “dl” designator code we have contractual arrangements with 

 

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our “dl” designator code we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

skywest airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement this proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

general 

while jet fuel prices fell during the latter part of 2014 fuel expense remains our single largest expense we have historically purchased most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

monroe energy 

global jet fuel demand continues to increase while the advent of domestic shale oil production in the us has reduced the threat of us refinery closures beyond those that have already closed further capacity reduction is expected in europe thus impacting supply in the atlantic basin and ultimately increasing refinery margins in the us our whollyowned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively “monroe” are distinct from us operating under their own management teams and with their own boards of managers they operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk   

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining 185000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined products “nonjet fuel products” monroe sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers 

strategic agreements   under multiyear agreements monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations  substantially all of the refinerys expected production of nonjet fuel products is included in these agreements 

segments  because the products and services of monroes refinery operations are discrete from our airline services segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment   financial information on our segment reporting can be found in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel hedging program 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and   frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets   we rebalance the hedge portfolio from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  

 4 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including fuel produced by monroe or procured through the exchange of nonjet fuel products the refinery produces and crude oil for monroes operations however it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel and crude oil weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in refining capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles ®  frequent flyer program skymiles program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage credit for travel awards by flying on delta its regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits miles do not expire but are subject to the program rules we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs ® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacitycontrolled seating in 2014  program members redeemed more than 296 billion miles in the skymiles program for 125 million award redemptions during this period 74 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect all of the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aerolíneas argentinas aeroméxico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china cargo airlines china southern cargo czech airlines cargo and korean air cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

delta techops delta global services mlt vacations and delta private jets 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” staffing services for third parties vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations in 2014 the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 850 million 

   

 

 

 

distribution and expanded product offerings 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including deltacom and mobile telephone reservations and traditional brick and mortar and online travel agencies an increasing number of our tickets are sold through delta digital channels which reduces our distribution costs and gives us improved and direct personalized interaction with our customers 

 5 

we are transforming distribution to a merchandised approach by introducing welldefined and differentiated products available to our customers we will offer five products which include premium amenities and services in delta one tm  first class and delta comfort tm  formerly economy comfort tm  while main cabin and basic economy options allow customers to match the level of service with their preferences we expect that these merchandising initiatives implemented primarily through delta’s digital channels will allow customers to better understand our product offerings make it easier to buy the products they desire and increase customer satisfaction 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs the industry is going through a period of transformation through consolidation both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is increasing from wellfunded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and latin america are government supported or funded which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have altered competition in international markets 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

 7 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia jfk and newark in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

emissions  the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date the icao has adopted two additional aircraft engine emissions standards the first of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 and the second of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2013 in june 2012 the epa published a final rulemaking for new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen nox adopting icaos additional standards included in the rule are two new tiers of more stringent emission standards for nox   these standards referred to as the tier 6 standards become effective for newlymanufactured aircraft engines beginning in 2013 

concern about aviation environmental issues including climate change and greenhouse gases has led to taxes on our operations in the united kingdom and in germany both of which have levied taxes directly on our customers we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions this could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations ongoing bilateral discussions between the us and other nations may lead to international treaties or other actions focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation in addition at the 38 th  icao assembly that concluded october 4 2013 in montreal the assembly adopted a climate change resolution committing icao to develop a global marketbased measure to be finalized at the 2016 icao assembly which would enable the airline industry to achieve carbonneutral growth from 2020 

the european union has required its member states to implement regulations including aviation in its emissions trading scheme “ets” under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets the ets has been amended to apply only to flights within the european economic area “eea” from 2013 through 2016 as a result we operate a limited number of flights that will be subject to the ets through 2016 after 2016 the ets would apply to all flights originating or landing in the european union 

  

cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the us in addition other legislative or regulatory action including by the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible in particular the epa has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the us or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the european union where we operate or where we  may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

 8 

we seek to minimize the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our greenhouse gas emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement of older less fuel efficient aircraft and replacement with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national  air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread in addition foreign governments may allow airports to enact similar restrictions which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditure in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and  greenhouse gas emissions 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted renewable fuel standards “rfs” that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel “transportation fuels” renewable identification numbers “rins” are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa 

other environmental matters  we had been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and entered into consent decrees or settlements regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites was small or was considered de minimis  when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site 

we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and aircraft drinking water 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2015 the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in self help self help includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 80000  fulltime equivalent employees approximately 18  of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



in addition 210  refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 28 2015 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act  nlra  which generally allows either party to engage in self help upon the expiration of the agreement formal negotiations toward a new or amended agreement have commenced   

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors   

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been highly volatile during the last several years in 2014  our average fuel price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedges was 347  a 16  increase from our average fuel price in 2013  in 2013  our average fuel price per gallon was 300  an 8  decrease from our average fuel price in 2012  in 2012  our average fuel price per gallon was 325  a 6 increase from our average fuel price in 2011  which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 35  33  and 36  of our operating expense in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

our ability to pass along the higher fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry until recently we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future this is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our whollyowned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with third parties the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from monroe could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results 

weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits we expect to achieve from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

under one of the strategic agreements that monroe has with a significant counterparty monroe is exchanging nonjet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of nonjet fuel products to the counterparty and the counterparty is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us if either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement if the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations 

 12 

in addition the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged if monroes cost of producing the nonjet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel the effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio or marktomarket adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets we rebalance the hedge portfolio from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates in addition we record marktomarket adjustments “mtm adjustments” on our fuel hedges mtm adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods losses from rebalancing or mtm adjustments or both may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may require us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant liability although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a negative public perception which could harm our reputation resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to required appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures these changes could result from factors that are not under our control although we are in compliance with covenant and collateral requirements a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 

the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and our cash may become restricted we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements 

 13 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our   operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2014  approximately 18  of our workforce primarily pilots was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the nlra which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if thirdparty regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub or gateway airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub or gateway airports in amsterdam detroit los angeles minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city seattle and tokyonarita each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other delta hubs and gateways a significant extended interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or gateways could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

disruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer 

a serious internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at thirdparty locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network a significant individual sustained or repeated failure of our network including thirdparty networks we utilize and on which we depend could impact our customer service and result in increased costs 

our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

in addition as a part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy 

 14 

our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security the methods used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information however the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data the compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on technology in our operations if our technology does not perform reliably our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to enhance customer service reduce costs and increase operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in deltacom mobile device applications checkin kiosks and related initiatives including security for these initiatives the performance reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively if our technology does not perform reliably our business and operations could be negatively affected 

our business is subject to the effects of weather natural disasters and seasonality which can cause our results to fluctuate 

our results of operations are impacted by severe weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in the frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by our thirdparty regional   carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including thirdparty carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over their operations in particular thirdparty regional carriers may face a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines if this shortage occurs thirdparty regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us to the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 15 

the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroe could incur substantial losses including cleanup costs fines and other sanctions and thirdparty claims and its operations could be interrupted as a result of such an incident monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position 

the operation of the refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions monroe could incur fines and other sanctions cleanup costs and thirdparty claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental health and safety requirements which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for monroe or restrict its operations 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa has adopted rfs that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels rins are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa as a result monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have recently been volatile increasing significantly during 2013 before returning to more moderate levels and then increasing again in late 2014 we cannot predict the future prices of rins purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroes products could limit the refinerys production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we lose senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and these persons are not replaced by individuals with equal or greater skills our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

 16 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the domestic airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers including american airlines and united airlines national pointtopoint carriers including alaska airlines jetblue airways and southwest airlines and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us pointtopoint discount and ultra lowcost carriers including spirit airlines and allegiant air place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is increasing from wellfunded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad airways and qatar airways these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the united states from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and latin america are government supported or funded which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships 

in addition several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united airlines air canada and lufthansa german airlines a transpacific joint venture between united airlines and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines 

increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government adopted a significant increase in the per ticket tax effective in july 2014 and has proposed additional fees additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

 17 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast us have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the us while enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until april 2017 if fully implemented we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the european union other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

as a result of the discretionary nature of air travel the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions because we operate globally with almost 35 of our revenues from operations outside of the us our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world during periods of unfavorable economic conditions in the global economy demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing if unfavorable economic conditions occur particularly for an extended period our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial conditions and results of operations 

terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security breaches may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

potential terrorist attacks geopolitical conflict or security breaches or fear of such events even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry could negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security insurance costs impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring reputational harm and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales if any or all of these events occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness or fear of such an event can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

  

in 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed against delta and airtran airways “airtran” alleging that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtrans ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag deltas imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtrans imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the first bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings and remain pending in the northern district of georgia a motion for class certification has been filed but the court has not yet ruled on it and no class has been certified to date delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits 

eu regulation 261 class action litigation 

in february 2011 a putative class action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois seeking to represent all us residents who were passengers on flights during the period from february 2009 to the present who are allegedly entitled to compensation under eu regulation 261 because their flight was cancelled or delayed by more than three hours plaintiffs allege that delta has incorporated a duty to pay this compensation into its contract of carriage and assert a claim for breach of contract as the basis for their cause of action the complaint seeks recovery of the eu regulation 261 compensation of €600 for each us resident on a flight qualifying for such compensation in october 2013 the district court granted delta’s motion to dismiss all claims with prejudice the plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit which remains pending delta disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results   of operations 

financial highlights  2014  compared to 2013   

our pretax income for 2014  was  11 billion  representing a  15 billion  decrease compared to prior year as a result of 35 billion of special items excluding special items pretax income increased 19 billion or 70 to 45 billion  primarily driven by higher passenger revenue lower fuel prices and flat nonfuel unit cost growth 

revenue  our passenger revenue increased  20 billion  or 6 compared to prior year due to a 2  increase in passenger mile yield on 4  higher traffic passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm increased 3  on 3  higher capacity our ability to maintain revenue momentum was driven by a strong domestic demand environment higher corporate sales and merchandising initiatives 

operating expense  total operating expense increased 38 billion  from 2013  driven by the special items noted above and discussed below our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile casm for 2014  increased 8  to 1592 cent s from 1477 cent s in 2013  on a 3  increase in capacity nonfuel unit costs casmex a nongaap financial measure increased 02  to 916 cent s in 2014  compared to 2013  

the increase in total operating expense is primarily due to special items recorded during the year including 23 billion  related to unfavorable mtm adjustments on fuel hedges and 716 million  of restructuring and other primarily associated with our fleet restructuring initiatives the mtm adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods and were driven by the significant decrease in crude oil prices during the year from a high of 115 per barrel in june to a low of 57 per barrel at december 31 2014  such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period the fleet restructuring initiatives relate to 1 the early retirement of b747400 aircraft associated with our ongoing optimization of the pacific network and 2 the restructuring of our domestic fleet by replacing a significant portion of our 50seat regional flying with more efficient and customer preferred crj900 and b717200 aircraft and replacing older less cost effective b757200 aircraft with b737900er aircraft 

the increase in our total operating expense also reflects higher profit sharing higher salaries and related costs and volumebased cost increases driven by the increase in capacity these increases were partially offset by a reduction in regional carrier expense primarily related to lower fuel costs salaries and related costs are higher primarily due to employee investments 

the nongaap financial measures for pretax income adjusted for special items and casmex used in this section are defined and reconciled in supplemental information below 

company initiatives 

network strategy 

we are implementing several strategies that are designed to strengthen and expand our global network and presence these primarily include our investment in and joint venture with virgin atlantic and efforts to optimize the pacific network in support of these strategies in the december 2014 quarter we announced our order for 50 new widebody aircraft for delivery beginning in 2017 consisting of 25 a330900neo aircraft which will mainly be deployed across the atlantic and 25 a350900 aircraft which will primarily serve the pacific region 

virgin atlantic investment  we own a noncontrolling 49  equity stake in virgin atlantic limited the parent company of virgin atlantic airways  we also have a transatlantic joint venture with virgin atlantic airways with respect to operations on nonstop routes between the united kingdom and north america for which we have antitrust immunity the relationship allows for joint marketing and sales coordinated pricing and revenue management network planning and scheduling virgin atlantic has a significant presence at londons heathrow airport the airport of choice for business customers traveling to and from london along with our state of the art facility at jfk our relationship with virgin atlantic has provided our customers with superior service and connectivity between new york and london we expect our joint venture with virgin atlantic to increase capacity between the us and united kingdom by approximately 10 to 39 peak daily round trips in 2015 this reflects a substantial increase from the minimal presence we had to the united kingdom five years ago 

 26 

pacific strategy  as part of the pacific strategy we are realigning our pacific fleet by removing less efficient b747400 aircraft and replacing them with smaller gauge widebody aircraft we are redeploying from the transatlantic the smaller gauge aircraft will help better match capacity with demand in the pacific and are expected to improve margin additionally as noted above we will be taking delivery of a350900 aircraft beginning in 2017 which when coupled with deliveries of a330300 aircraft that we will receive over the next several years will result in a 1520 reduction in seats per departure and generate a significant improvement in operating cost per seat 

we have also made a significant investment in developing seattle as a hub and international gateway which will provide for convenient access to and from the pacific we expect to leverage our domestic network to feed traffic into seattle and increase peak daily departures to 120 in 2015 as a result seattle will allow us to offer onestop service to 95 of our west coast to asia traffic flows 

maintaining cost performance 

as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain cost performance we continue to be focused on keeping the rate of casmex growth at less than 2 annually fleet restructuring is an important component of our cost initiatives and is focused on lowering unit costs while enhancing the customer experience we are restructuring our domestic fleet by replacing a significant portion of our 50seat regional flying with more efficient and customer preferred crj900 and b717200 aircraft and replacing older less cost effective b757200 aircraft with b737900er aircraft during the year ended december 31 2014 we took delivery of 26 crj900 39 b717200 and 19 b737900er aircraft we are retiring a significant portion of the 50seat regional fleet that we lease as part of the fleet restructuring activities we expect to continue to recognize restructuring charges representing the remaining obligations under the leases as we retire the leased aircraft although many factors could change over the period of the 50seat fleet restructuring we currently estimate that future charges will be between 50 million to 150 million as a result of restructuring the fleet we expect to benefit from improved operational and fuel efficiency customer service and reduced future maintenance cost that we will experience over the life of the new aircraft 

skymiles program 

during the march 2014 quarter we announced changes to the skymiles program effective january 1 2015 the skymiles program was modified from a model in which customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on distance traveled to a model based on ticket price customers earn between five and 11 miles per dollar spent based on their skymiles status and will continue to earn up to an additional two miles per dollar when using their delta skymiles credit card for a total of up to 13 miles per dollar the modified program will better reward customers who spend more with delta and give them improved mileageearning opportunities the skymiles program includes a new award redemption structure that improves award seat availability at the lowest point redemption levels offers oneway awards at half the price of roundtrip provides new miles plus cash award options as well as makes significant improvements to deltacom and delta reservations award shopping tools

results of operations  2014  compared to 2013   

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue increased 20 billion  or 6  over prior year prasm increased 3  and passenger mile yield increased 2  on 3  higher capacity load factor was 09  points higher than prior year at 847  

our geographic regions generally performed well compared to the prior year with the domestic region leading yearoveryear unit revenue improvement unit revenues of the domestic region rose 8  led by strong performances from our hubs in atlanta new yorklaguardia and seattle 

revenues related to our international regions increased 3 yearoveryear primarily due to 18  capacity growth in the latin america region as a result of our efforts to improve connections with gol and aeroméxico gol and aeroméxico contributed a significant portion of the traffic from the us to brazil and into key mexico markets respectively despite these contributions latin america unit revenues declined 2  as a result of the capacity increase some business demand weakness associated with the fifa world cup in brazil and economic concerns in venezuela atlantic unit revenue increased 2  driven by yield improvements while our joint venture with virgin atlantic reflected solid revenue growth especially in londonheathrow atlantic yields experienced pressure from the impact of geopolitical and health concerns related to service to africa the middle east and russia our pacific region experienced a 4  decline in unit revenues driven by lower yield primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen 

other revenue other revenue increased  580 million  or 15  primarily due to an increase in sales of skymiles settlements associated with our transatlantic joint venture agreements and sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery 

 28 

operating expense 



 

fuel expense compared to the prior year consolidated fuel expense increased 20 billion  due to unfavorable mtm adjustments on fuel hedges resulting from the significant decrease in crude oil prices during the year from a high of 115 per barrel in june to a low of 57 per barrel at december 31 2014 and a 2  increase in consumption partially offset by an 8  decrease in fuel market price per gallon and increased profitability at monroe the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and average price per gallon including the impact of hedging and the refinery 



 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted 



 

 29 

fuel purchase cost  fuel purchase cost is based on the market price for jet fuel at airport locations 

airline segment fuel hedge impact and mtm adjustments  during the year ended december 31 2014  our airline segment fuel hedge loss of 23 billion  resulted from unfavorable mtm adjustments these mtm adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period the mtm adjustments are reflected in the table above to calculate an effective fuel cost for the period 

refinery segment impact  the refinery results include the impact on fuel expense of selfsupply from the production of the refinery and from refined products exchanged with certain counterparties to the extent that we account for exchanges of refined products as nonmonetary transactions we include the results of those transactions within fuel expense for additional information regarding the refinery segment impact see refinery segment below 

we adjust fuel expense for the items noted above to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost our average price per gallon adjusted a nongaap financial measure was 287  for the year ended december 31 2014  

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to investments in our employees and an increase in pilot and flight attendant block hours partially offset by lower pension expense in 2014 we contributed 917 million  to our defined benefit pension plans including 250 million  above the minimum funding requirements 

regional carrier expense the reduction in regional carrier expense is primarily due to lower fuel expense from both a decrease in the cost of fuel per gallon and a 4  decrease in capacity and fewer required maintenance events during 2014 we removed thirtyfive 50seat regional aircraft from our fleet as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and costs associated with maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business the reduction in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs is due primarily to lower engine maintenance volume and a contract settlement charge in 2013 partially offset by a higher volume of cost of sales from our mro business 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to investments in new b737900er and crj900 aircraft the purchase of aircraft offlease and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering 

contracted services contracted services expense increased yearoveryear due primarily to costs associated with the 3  increase in capacity 

passenger commissions and other selling expenses passenger commissions and other selling expenses increased on higher passenger revenue 

profit sharing  the increase in profit sharing is driven by an increase in full year pretax income excluding profit sharing and special items compared to the prior year our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit excluding profit sharing and special items such as mtm adjustments and restructuring and other items our profit sharing program pays 10 to employees for the first 25 billion of annual profit and 20 of annual profit above 25 billion   

aircraft rent aircraft rent increased yearoveryear due primarily to the addition of leased b717200 and b737900er aircraft delivered during the year partially offset by the retirement of certain b747400 aircraft 

other  other operating expense increased primarily due to costs associated with sales of nonjet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery 

 30 

results of operations  2013  compared to 2012   

operating revenue 



passenger revenue 

passenger revenue increased 12 billion  or 4  on a 3  prasm increase and a 3  increase in passenger mile yield revenue remained strong despite lower fuel prices in addition the increase in passenger revenue reflects inflight product enhancements such as the economy comfort product and higher corporate sales 

our geographic regions performed well compared to the prior year with the domestic region leading yearoveryear unit revenue improvement as a result of higher passenger mile yield unit revenues of the domestic region rose by over 5 with notable improvements in the new york market new york unit revenues increased as we continue to see improvements due to our investments in jfk and laguardia as well as many inflight product enhancements revenues related to our international regions increased 3 yearoveryear with slight unit revenue improvements in both atlantic and latin america regions our pacific region experienced a slight decline in unit revenues primarily due to the japanese yen devaluation 

 31 

operating expense 



 

fuel expense including regional carriers fuel expense decreased 787 million  due to a 4  decrease in fuel market price per gallon and fuel hedge gains partially offset by a 2  increase in consumption the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per gallon including the impact of hedging and the refinery 



  

 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted

fuel purchase cost  fuel purchase cost is based on the market price for jet fuel at airport locations 

airline segment fuel hedge impact and mtm adjustments  during the year ended december 31 2013 our airline segment fuel hedge gains of 444 million  included 276 million  of favorable mtm adjustments these mtm adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period the mtm adjustments are reflected in the table above to calculate an effective fuel cost for the period 

refinery segment impact  the refinery results include the impact on fuel expense of selfsupply from the production of the refinery and from refined products exchanged with certain counterparties to the extent that we account for exchanges of refined products as nonmonetary transactions we include the results of those transactions within fuel expense for additional information regarding the refinery segment impact see refinery segment below 

we adjust fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost our average price per gallon adjusted a nongaap financial measure was 307  for the year ended december 31 2013 

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to investments in our employees during the june 2012 quarter we reached an agreement with the air line pilots association alpa that increased pay and benefits for our pilots our pilots and substantially all other employees received base pay increases on july 1 2012 and received additional increases on january 1 2013 these increases are designed both to recognize changes to the profit sharing program described below and to accelerate the planned 2013 pay increase for nonpilot employees 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and costs associated with maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business the reduction in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs is primarily due to a lower volume of sales to third parties of our mro services and the timing of maintenance events on our fleet 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to our investment in new b737900er and crj900 aircraft the purchase of aircraft offlease and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering 

contracted services contracted services expense increased yearoveryear due primarily to the impact of severe winter storms on our operations and costs associated with the 1 increase in capacity 

landing fees and other rents landing fees and other rents increased yearoveryear primarily due to our investment in airport facilities 

profit sharing  our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit excluding profit sharing and special items such as mtm adjustments and restructuring and other items from pretax profit during the june 2012 quarter our profit sharing program was modified so that we pay 10 of profits on the first 25 billion of annual profits effective with the plan year beginning january 1 2013 compared to paying 15 of annual profit for the 2012 plan year under the program we will continue to pay 20 of annual profit above 25 billion 

aircraft rent aircraft rent decreased yearoveryear due primarily due to the purchase of various aircraft offlease 

 33 

nonoperating results 



the decline in interest expense net is driven by reduced levels of debt and the refinancing of debt obligations at lower interest rates our principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from 144 billion at the beginning of 2012 to 99 billion at   december 31 2014  

in each of 2014 and 2012 we extinguished 16 billion  of existing debt under our secured financing arrangements prior to scheduled maturity in connection with the extinguishment we recorded losses of 268 million  and 118 million  respectively for the difference between the principal paid and the carrying value of the debt which included unamortized discounts or premiums and unamortized issuance costs the unamortized debt discounts resulted from fair value adjustments recorded in the 2008 purchase accounting of northwest airlines the losses also included premiums paid to retire the debt 

miscellaneous net is unfavorable primarily due to our proportionate share of losses from our equity investment in virgin atlantic foreign currency exchange rate losses and a charge associated with the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar the loss from virgin atlantic primarily results from unfavorable mtm adjustments on fuel hedges 

income taxes 

we consider all income sources including other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax provision benefit allocated to continuing operations the following table shows the components of our income tax provision benefit 



we released substantially all of our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets on december 31 2013 the release of the allowance primarily resulted in a net tax benefit of 80 billion that was recorded in income tax provision benefit in our consolidated statement of operations our annual effective tax rate for 2014 was 385  at december 31 2014  we had over 120 billion  of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards which do not begin to expire until 2024  accordingly we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next few years see note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

during 2012 we did not record an income tax provision for us federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets were fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

 34 

refinery segment 

the refinery primarily produces gasoline diesel and jet fuel under multiyear agreements monroe exchanges the nonjet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations  the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 150000 barrels approximately six million gallons per day for use in airline operations during 2014  

a refinery is subject to epa requirements that are established each year to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa we recognized 111 million and 64 million of expense related to the rins requirement in 2014 and 2013 respectively including accruals for our unsettled 2013 and 2014 rins obligation as of december 31 2014 we are in possession of the rins needed to satisfy our 2013 obligation 

the refinery recorded a profit of  96 million  in 2014  compared to losses of  116 million  and  63 million  recorded in 2013 and 2012 respectively we believe that the increase in jet fuel supply due to the refinerys operation has reduced the overall market price of jet fuel and thus lowered our cost of jet fuel 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2014  we had 52 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 33 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 19 billion  in undrawn revolving credit facilities during 2014  we generated 49 billion  in cash from operating activities which we used along with existing cash to reduce the principal on our debt and capital lease obligations by 19 billion fund capital expenditures of 22 billion and return 14 billion to shareholders while maintaining a solid liquidity position 

sources of liquidity 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated positive cash flows from operations of 49 billion  in 2014  45 billion  in 2013  and 25 billion  in 2012  we also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2015  

our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date when we receive a cash payment at the time of sale we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as we have increased sales in advance of the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months 

fuel and fuel hedge margins  the cost of jet fuel is our most significant expense representing approximately 35  of our total operating expenses for 2014  the market price for jet fuel is highly volatile which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations from period to period 

we have jet fuel inventories used in our airline operations at various airport locations and in pipelines we also have refined oil product inventories that are used in our refinery operations jet fuel and refined oil product inventories are recorded as fuel inventory 

as part of our fuel hedging program we may be required to post margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position conversely if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position we may receive margin our future cash flows are impacted by the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying our derivative contracts as a result of the significant decreases in crude oil prices during 2014 the fair value of our hedge contracts were in a loss position at december 31 2014  resulting in 925 million  of margin postings to counterparties 

 35 

timing of skymiles sales  in december 2011 we amended our american express agreements and agreed to sell 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles to american express in each december from 2011 through 2014 pursuant to the december 2011 amendment american express purchased 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles in each of 2012  and 2013  with the final payment in 2014  the skymiles purchased in december 2014 are expected to be utilized by american express in 2015 

in 2008 we entered into a multiyear extension of our american express agreements and received 10 billion from american express for an advance purchase of restricted skymiles the agreement as modified provided that our obligations with respect to the advance purchase would be satisfied as american express used the purchased miles over a specified future period “skymiles usage period” during the skymiles usage period which commenced in december 2011 american express utilized skymiles valued at 333 million annually over three years instead of paying cash to delta for skymiles used in december 2013 we and american express amended this agreement to allow american express to use the remaining skymiles valued at 285 million immediately and without restriction as of december 31 2014 american express had utilized the remaining skymiles associated with this advance purchase 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the pension protection act of 2006 in 2014 we contributed 917 million  to our defined benefit pension plans including 250 million  above the minimum funding requirements these contributions satisfied the required contributions for our defined benefit plans for 2014 on an accelerated basis we contributed 914 million  in 2013  including 250 million above the minimum funding levels and 697 million in 2012  to our defined benefit pension plans we estimate the funding under these plans will total at least 950 million  in 2015  including 340 million  above the minimum funding requirements 

profit sharing as discussed above our broadbased employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the program defines profit as pretax profit excluding profit sharing and special items such as mtm adjustments and restructuring and other items our profit sharing program pays 10 to employees on the first 25 billion of annual profits and 20 of annual profits above 25 billion 

we paid 506 million  in profit sharing in february 2014 related to our 2013 pretax profit and 372 million  in 2013 related to our 2012 pretax profit in recognition of our employees contributions toward meeting our financial goals during the year ended december 2014 we recorded 11 billion  in profit sharing expense based on 2014 pretax profit to further show our appreciation to our employees we made an advanced 2014 profit sharing payment totaling more than 300 million equal to 5 of pay for eligible employees in october 2014 

investing activities   

capital expenditures we incurred capital expenditures of 22 billion in 2014  26 billion in 2013  and 20 billion in 2012  our capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering 

we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft we expect that we will invest approximately 28 billion in 2015 primarily for 1 aircraft including deliveries of b737900ers and a330300s along with advance deposit payments for these and our new a321200 a330900neo and a350900 orders as well as for 2 aircraft modifications the majority of which relate to enhancing the cabins of our international fleet we expect that the 2015 investments will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations 

shortterm investments during the september 2014 quarter we modified our approach to managing shortterm investments by investing 15 billion  of cash reserves in externally managed investment accounts these new investments are comprised of us government and agency securities asset and mortgagebacked securities corporate obligations and other fixed term securities the new approach is expected to generate a greater return with a low level of risk due to diversification

financing activities 

debt and capital leases our principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from 144 billion at the beginning of 2012 to 99 billion at   december 31 2014  since december 31 2009 we have reduced our principal amount of debt and capital leases by 84 billion we have focused on reducing our total debt in recent years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet in addition we have refinanced debt to reduce our total future interest expense 

capital returns to shareholders in may 2013 we announced a plan to return more than 1 billion to shareholders over the next three years as part of this plan our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend program and a 500 million share repurchase program which was to be completed no later than june 30 2016 we completed this share repurchase authorization during the june 2014 quarter 

in may 2014 we announced the next phase of capital returns to shareholders the board of directors approved a program to increase the quarterly dividend by 50 to 009 per share beginning in the september 2014 quarter and authorized a new 2 billion share repurchase program to be completed no later than december 31 2016 together the increased dividend program and the new repurchase program are expected to return 275 billion to shareholders through 2016 during the year ended december 31 2014 we repurchased and retired 213 million shares at a cost of 850 million under the new program including the shares repurchased under the may 2013 share repurchase authorization we repurchased and retired 286 million shares at a cost of 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 

on october 24 2014 the board of directors declared a 009 per share dividend for shareholders of record as of november 7 2014 this dividend was paid in december 2014 and totaled 75 million including dividend payments in the first three quarters we paid 251 million of dividends for the year ended december 31 2014 on february 6 2015 the board of directors declared a 009 per share dividend for shareholders of record as of february 20 2015 

undrawn lines of credit 

we have available 19 billion  in undrawn revolving lines of credit our credit facilities have covenants including minimum collateral coverage ratios if we are not in compliance with these covenants we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them we currently have a substantial amount of unencumbered assets available to pledge as collateral 

covenants 

      we were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at   december 31 2014  

 37 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2014  that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments representing obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 



  

 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt 

longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using libor at december 31 2014  

operating lease payments future aircraft leases  represents estimates of lease payments on the remaining 36  b717200 aircraft still to be delivered in 2015 pursuant to our lease agreement with southwest airlines and on the subsequent lease agreement with the boeing company on our b717200 fleet 

aircraft purchase commitments represents our commitments to purchase 69  b737900er 45  a321200 25  a330900neo 25  a350900 18  b7878 10  a330300 and two  crj900 aircraft our purchase commitment for the 18  b7878 aircraft provides for certain aircraft substitution rights 

contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying 

employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our employee benefit obligations see “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

 38 

other obligations represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other thirdparty services and products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” offers incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements and airlines that participate in the skymiles program as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines effective january 1 2015 the skymiles program was modified from a model in which customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on distance traveled to a model based on ticket price this award change did not affect the way we account for the program   

the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below these are 1 passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and 2 the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with two deliverables 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation   we value each deliverable on a standalone basis our estimate of the selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers which is reevaluated at least annually we use established ticket prices to determine the estimated selling price of air transportation we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 

we defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused  a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately 53 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of mileage credits   customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables as defined below 

our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express in december 2014 we amended our marketing agreements with american express which increased the value we will receive under the agreements and extended the term to 2022 the amended agreements became effective january 1 2015 the deliverables under the amended agreements are substantially similar to the previous agreement we will account for the amended agreements consistent with the accounting method adopted in september 2013 that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered based on their relative selling prices the increased value received under the amended agreements will increase the amount of deferred revenue for the travel component and increase the value of the other deliverables which are recognized in other revenue as they are provided   

 39 

in september 2013 we modified our marketing agreements with american express that required us to change the accounting method for recording skymiles sold under the previous method the embedded premium or discount was allocated to the residual products or services in a combined transaction the new method allocates consideration received based on the relative selling price of each product or service we determined our best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees access to delta sky club lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta and 4 brand value the impact of adopting the relative selling price method reallocated a portion of the embedded discount to the travel component lowering the deferral rate we use to record miles sold under the agreements and increasing revenue recognized on the remaining deliverables   

we recognize revenue as we deliver each sales element we defer the travel deliverable miles as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel the revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables is recorded in other revenue we recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed   

breakage for mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed management uses statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years  at december 31 2014  the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 42 billion  a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 28 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2014  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis we assess the value of our goodwill and indefinitelived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider various market factors including the key assumptions listed below we analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below if the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value   

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering market capitalization and other factors when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 a combination of limited market transactions and the lease savings method for certain airport slots which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates 3 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 4 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach   

key assumptions  the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows 2 terminal period revenue growth and cash flows 3 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 4 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 5 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates in addition we consider the amount by which the intangible assets fair value exceeded their carrying value in the most recent fair value measurement calculated using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs primarily related to fuel and employees 3 lower passenger demand as a result of weakened us and global economies 4 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 5 changes to the regulatory environment eg diminished slot restrictions or additional open skies agreements 6 competitive changes by other airlines and 7 strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets   

 40 

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances the stabilizing operating environment for us airlines has resulted in annual yields increasing along with load factors leading to improved financial results 

goodwill  our goodwill balance which is related to the airline segment was 98 billion  at december 31 2014  we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets which are related to the airline segment had a net carrying amount of 46 billion  at december 31 2014  of which 44 billion  related to indefinitelived intangible assets  indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements definitelived assets consist primarily of marketing and partner agreements 

in 2014  we performed a quantitative assessment of our pacific routes and slots indefinitelived intangible asset and determined that there was no indication that the asset was impaired we obtained this asset as part of the acquisition of northwest airlines in 2008 and is composed of pacific route authorities and takeoff and landing rights “slots” at tokyonarita international airport narita this intangible asset supports delta’s narita hub activities and is essential to deltas pacific network as of the 2014 assessment the estimated fair value of the pacific routes and slots intangible asset exceeded the 22 billion carrying value by approximately 20 changes in key inputs and assumptions including 1 our strategy related to the composition of our pacific network and flying 2 new or enhanced joint ventures or alliances 3 foreign currency exchange rates 4 fuel costs and 5 pacific region profitability could impact the value of this asset in the future 

we performed a qualitative assessment of all other indefinitelived intangible assets and determined that there was no indication that our indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired the qualitative assessments included analyses and weighting of all relevant factors including the applicable factors noted above which impact the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 219 billion  at december 31 2014  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we record impairment losses on flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleets carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

income tax valuation allowance 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets we establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things projected future taxable income scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results and tax planning strategies  in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred income tax assets the significant factors that we consider include 1 our recent history of profitability 2 growth in the us and global economies 3 forecast of airline revenue trends 4 estimate of future fuel prices and 5 future impact of taxable temporary differences 

 41 

we recorded a full valuation allowance in 2004 due to our cumulative loss position at that time during 2013  after considering all positive and negative evidence we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized accordingly we released substantially all of the valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets we recognized an 80 billion  benefit in our provision for income taxes primarily related to the valuation allowance release 

at the end of 2014  our net deferred tax asset balance was 76 billion  against which we maintained a 46 million  valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating losses with limited expiration periods   

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals  as of december 31 2014  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 125 billion  during 2014  we contributed 917 million  to these plans and recorded 233 million  of expense in salaries and related costs on our consolidated statement of operations in 2015 we estimate we will contribute at least 950 million  to these plans including 340 million  of contributions above the minimum funding requirements and that our expense will be approximately 250 million the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 414  and 501  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 410  to 499  between 2014  and 2012  

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data   modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets   we review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually   our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation   our actual historical annualized three and five year rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans was approximately 11  and 9  respectively as of december 31 2014  the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a longterm return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan this is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity fixed income real assets hedge funds and other assets and instruments   our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended   december 31 2014  was 9  

life expectancy  we have historically utilized the society of actuaries soa published mortality data in developing a best estimate of life expectancy on october 27 2014 the soa published updated mortality tables for us plans and an updated improvement scale which both reflect improved longevity based on an evaluation of these new tables and our perspective of future longevity we updated the mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations at december 31 2014  the improvement in life expectancy increases our benefit obligations and future expense as benefit payments are paid over an extended period of time   

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



 42 

funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen delta elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an   885   discount rate   

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers while the standard supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance it closely aligns with current gaap under the new standard revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer for the amount of consideration received for that specific good or service it is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim reporting periods and early adoption is not permitted entities may use a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption we are currently evaluating the impact if any the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements   

reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 comprehensive income the standard revises the reporting of items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2012 we adopted this guidance in the march 2013 quarter and have presented amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in a note to the financial statements for additional information see note 15 

presentation of comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income the standard revises the presentation and prominence of the items reported in other comprehensive income and is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted this standard in 2012 and have presented comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

changes in aircraft fuel prices materially impact our results of operations   we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel we utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and   frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets   we rebalance the hedge portfolio from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  

our fuel hedge portfolio consists of options swaps and futures the hedge contracts include crude oil diesel fuel and jet fuel as these commodities are highly correlated with the price of jet fuel that we consume our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices change significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin we may adjust our hedge portfolio from time to time in response to margin posting requirements 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers accounted for 135 billion  or 35  of our total operating expense we recognized 20 billion  of fuel hedge losses during the year ended december 31 2014  due to unfavorable mtm adjustments 

the following table shows the projected cash impact to fuel cost assuming 20 and 40 increases or decreases in fuel prices the hedge gain loss reflects the change in the projected cash settlement value of our open fuel hedge contracts at january 31 2015 based on their contract settlement dates assuming the same 20 and 40 changes 



 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

 47 

at december 31 2014  we had 41 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 54 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 170 million at december 31 2014  and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 42 million exclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge contracts 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2014  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a 73 million  asset position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the japanese yen and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 60 million gain or 80 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2015

changes in internal control 

during the three months ended december 31 2014  we did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting   

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  using the criteria issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in the 2013 internal controlintegrated framework based on that evaluation management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm which also audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  ernst  young llps report on our internal control over financial reporting is set forth below

 item 1 business 

general 

we provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states and around the world our global route network gives us a presence in every major domestic and international market our route network is centered around a system of hub and international gateway airports that we operate in amsterdam atlanta cincinnati detroit minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city seattle and tokyonarita each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to domestic and international cities and to other hubs or gateways our network is supported by a fleet of aircraft that is varied in size and capabilities giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network 

other key characteristics of our route network include 

 

 

 

 

we are incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware our principal executive offices are located at hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport in atlanta georgia our telephone number is 404 7152600 and our internet address is wwwdeltacom information contained on our website is not part of and is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k 

international alliances 

our international alliance relationships range from our transatlantic and transpacific joint venture agreements to bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances these relationships are an important part of our business as they improve our access to international markets and enable us to market expanded and globally integrated air transportation services in general these arrangements include reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation and airport lounge access arrangements and may also include joint sales and marketing coordination colocation of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements these alliances also often present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing 

joint venture agreements we currently operate three joint ventures with foreign carriers these arrangements for which we have received antitrust immunity provide for the sharing of revenues and costs as well as joint marketing and sales coordinated pricing and revenue management network planning and scheduling and other coordinated activities with respect to the parties operations on joint venture routes the three joint ventures are

enhanced commercial agreements with latin american carriers we have separate strategic equity investments in grupo aeroméxico sab de cv the parent company of aeroméxico and gol linhas aéreas inteligentes sa the parent company of gol and an exclusive commercial relationship with each companys affiliated air carrier we invested in gol and aeroméxico because they operate in latin americas two largest markets brazil and mexico respectively the agreements provide for expansion of reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer program participation airport lounge access arrangements improved passenger connections and potential joint sales cooperation in addition to our commercial cooperation arrangements for passenger service with aeroméxico we and aeroméxico have established a joint venture relating to an airframe maintenance repair and overhaul operation located in queretaro mexico 

skyteam  in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam global airline alliance the other members of skyteam are aeroflot aerolineas argentinas aeroméxico air europa air france alitalia china airlines china eastern china southern csa czech airlines kenya airways klm korean air middle east airlines saudi arabian airlines tarom vietnam airlines and xiamen airlines garuda indonesia also has announced its formal intent to join skyteam through alliance arrangements with other skyteam carriers delta is able to link its network with the route networks of the other member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer arrangements and airport lounge access programs and coordinated cargo operations 

codeshare agreements  we also have international codeshare arrangements with the following international carriers some of which are carriers with which we also have more extensive relationships aeroflot aeroméxico air europa air france alitalia china airlines china eastern china southern csa czech airlines klm korean air olympic air vrg linhas aéreas operating as gol vietnam airlines virgin australia and westjet and affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with some of these airlines 

domestic alliances 

we have a marketing alliance with alaska airlines which includes reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements our alliance agreement with alaska airlines allows us to expand our west coast presence we also have reciprocal codesharing and frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements with hawaiian airlines 

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in smalland mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets approximately 19  of our passenger revenue in 2013 was related to flying by these regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program delta connection we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate regional jet and in certain cases turboprop aircraft using our “dl” designator code we have contractual arrangements with 

 

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our “dl” designator code and we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail and inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

skywest airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement this proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

general 

jet fuel costs remained at high levels in 2013 with fuel expense our single largest expense we have historically purchased most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

monroe energy 

global jet fuel demand continues to increase while the advent of domestic shale oil production in the us has reduced the threat of us refinery closures beyond those that have already closed further capacity reduction is expected in europe thus impacting supply in the atlantic basin and ultimately increasing refinery margins in the us our whollyowned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively “monroe” operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin we are paying the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and john f kennedy international airport jfk   

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining 185000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and other refined products “nonjet fuel products” bp is the primary supplier of crude oil used by the refinery under a three year agreement we source domestic crude oil supply when economical and are attempting to increase our overall domestic supply including from the bakken oil field in north dakota 

strategic agreements  under a multiyear agreement we are exchanging a significant portion of the nonjet fuel products with phillips 66 for jet fuel to be used in our airline operations substantially all of the remaining production of nonjet fuel products is being sold to bp under a buysell agreement effectively exchanging those nonjet fuel products for jet fuel our agreement with phillips 66 requires us to deliver specified quantities of nonjet fuel products and they are required to deliver jet fuel to us if we or phillips 66 do not have the specified quantity and type of product available the delivering party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement substantially all of the refinerys expected production of nonjet fuel products is included in these agreements 

segments  because the products and services of monroes refinery operations are discrete from our airline services segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment   financial information on our segment reporting can be found in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel hedging program 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel  this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types   the economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets the hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates 

 4 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including through our purchases from monroe and crude oil for monroes operations but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel and crude oil weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles ®  frequent flyer program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta deltas regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits miles do not expire but are subject to all program rules we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs ® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacitycontrolled seating in 2013  program members redeemed more than 271 billion miles in the skymiles program for 11 million award redemptions during this period 73 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect all of the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aerolineas argentinas aeromexico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china cargo airlines china southern cargo czech airlines cargo and korean air cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

delta techops delta global services mlt vacations and delta private jets 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” staffing services for third parties vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations in 2013 the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 800 million 

   

 

 

 

distribution and expanded product offerings 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including telephone reservations deltacom and traditional brick and mortar and online travel agencies an increasing number of our tickets are sold through deltacom which reduces our distribution costs and gives us closer contact with our customers 

 5 

we are transforming distribution from a commodity approach to a differentiated and merchandised approach we expect that the merchandising initiatives we are implementing primarily through deltacom will generate additional revenue opportunities for us and will improve the experience of our customers we provide our customers with opportunities to purchase what they value such as first class upgrades economy comfort tm  seating wifi access and skyclub passes we expect to benefit from increased traffic on deltacom through a combination of advertising revenue and sales of third party merchandise and services such as car rentals hotels and trip insurance 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs the industry is going through a period of transformation through consolidation both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years including through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk salt lake city and seattle either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada all nippon airways and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways iberia qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets 

increased competition has also emerged from wellfunded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad and qatar these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the united states from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and latin america are government supported or funded which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines in addition the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties that the us has with the member states of the european union japan and the gulf states could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american and japan air lines

regulatory matters 

the department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

 7 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia john f kennedy international airport and newark in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

emissions  the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date the icao has adopted two additional aircraft engine emissions standards the first of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 and the second of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2013 in june 2012 the epa published a final rulemaking for new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen nox adopting icaos additional standards included in the rule are two new tiers of more stringent emission standards for nox   these standards referred to as the tier 6 standards become effective for newlymanufactured aircraft engines beginning in 2013 

concern about aviation environmental issues including climate change and greenhouse gases has led to taxes on our operations in the united kingdom and in germany both of which have levied taxes directly on our customers we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the united states and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions this could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations ongoing bilateral discussions between the united states and other nations may lead to international treaties or other actions focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation in addition at the 38 th  icao assembly that concluded october 4 2013 in montreal the assembly adopted a climate change resolution committing icao to develop a global marketbased measure to be finalized at the 2016 icao assembly which would enable the airline industry to achieve carbonneutral growth from 2020 

the european union has required its member states to implement regulations including aviation in its emissions trading scheme “ets” under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets at the end of november 2012 the united states government enacted legislation exempting us airlines from the ets in april 2013 the european parliament deferred enforcement until april 2014 of the ets with respect to flights operated to and from noneu destinations however all intraeu flights on any carrier based in the eu or not had to comply with the requirements of the ets the european commission has proposed new legislation that would extend the ets beyond intraeu flights to include the portion of flights to and from the eu while in eu airspace for those countries whose international revenue ton kilometers exceeds a 1 de minimis threshold this legislation faces opposition from the united states and some eu member countries 

  

cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the united states in addition other legislative or regulatory action including by the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible in particular the epa has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the us or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the european union where we operate or where we  may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

 8 

we seek to minimize the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our greenhouse gas emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain elements of our fleet and with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national  air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and  greenhouse gas emissions 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the us environmental protection agency “epa” has adopted renewable fuel standards “rfs” that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers “rins” are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa 

other environmental matters  we had been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and entered into consent decrees or settlements regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites was small or was considered de minimis  when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site 

we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and aircraft drinking water 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international longrange aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2014 we have also committed aircraft to international shortrange requirements the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 78000  fulltime equivalent employees approximately 18  of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



1 we are in discussions with representatives of the flight superintendents 

in addition 210  refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 26 2015 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act which generally allows either party to engage in selfhelp upon the expiration of the agreement 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors   

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been extremely volatile during the last several years in 2013  our average fuel price per gallon was 300  an 8  decrease from our average fuel price in 2012 in 2012 our average fuel price per gallon was 325  a 6  increase from our average fuel price in 2011 in 2011 our average fuel price per gallon was 306  a 31 increase from our average fuel price in 2010 which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 33  36  and 36  of our operating expense in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to pass along the higher fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry until recently we often have not been able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future this is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase 

we acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our whollyowned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with bp and phillips 66 the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices 

our business and results of operations are also dependent on the availability of aircraft fuel significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from our whollyowned subsidiary would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in crude oil and fuel supply shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits we expect to achieve from buying fuel from monroe could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

under a strategic agreement that monroe has with phillips 66 monroe is exchanging nonjet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of nonjet fuel products to phillips 66 and phillips 66 is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us if either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the exchange agreements if the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations 

 12 

in addition the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged if monroes cost of producing the nonjet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our fuel hedging activities are intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our shortterm liquidity 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel  this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types the economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets the hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates and may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin which could have a material adverse impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

our funding obligation with respect to defined benefit pension plans we   sponsor is significant and can vary materially because of changes in   investment asset returns and values 

as of december 31 2013  our defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately 191 billion  and were funded through assets with a value of approximately 89 billion  the benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates neither of which is in our control we estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plans which are governed by erisa and have been frozen for future accruals is approximately 675 million in 2014 estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control including among other things the market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time which may be reflected in appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures these changes could result from factors that are not under our control a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 

the credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and our cash may become restricted we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements 

 13 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our   operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2013  approximately 18  of our workforce was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the national labor relations act nlra which generally allows selfhelp after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub or gateway airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub or gateway airports in amsterdam cincinnati detroit minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city seattle and tokyonarita each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other delta hubs and gateways a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or gateways could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks mobile device applications and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively because of the rapid pace of new developments these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected 

disruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise customer information and expose us to liability possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer 

any internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third party locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

 14 

in addition as a part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including personal information of our customers and employees the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy any compromise of our technology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information any such loss disclosure misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business 

our primary credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances the initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards our primary credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash if circumstances were to occur that would allow american express or our visamastercard processor to initiate a holdback the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant liability in the event that the insurance that we carry to cover damages arising from future accidents is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business 

our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality which can cause our results to fluctuate 

our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year the seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional   carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including third party carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers to the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 15 

the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to hazards associated with the operation of a refinery by monroe would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations 

the operation of a refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions if monroe violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations monroe could be fined or otherwise sanctioned which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for environmental matters for monroe 

under the energy independence and security act of 2007 the us environmental protection agency “epa” has adopted renewable fuel standards “rfs” that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and onroad diesel transportation fuels renewable identification numbers “rins” are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the us that are blended into transportation fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation a refinery may meet its obligation under rfs by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with transportation fuels or by purchasing rins in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing rins 

because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa monroe is exposed to the market price of rins market prices for rins have recently become volatile and increased significantly during 2013 before returning to more moderate levels we cannot predict the future prices of rins purchasing rins at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into monroes products could limit the refinerys production if sufficient numbers of rins are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

if we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and these persons are not replaced by individuals with equal or greater skills our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk salt lake city and seattle either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers 

discount carriers including southwest jetblue spirit and allegiant have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the united states and on other network carriers in the domestic market in addition network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets 

increased competition has also emerged from wellfunded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad and qatar these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the united states from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and latin america are government supported or funded which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines in addition the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties that the us has with the member states of the european union and japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines 

consolidation in the domestic airline industry changes in international alliances and the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

 17 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has adopted a significant increase in the per ticket tax effective in july 2014 and has recently proposed additional fees the ticket tax increase and additional taxes and fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast united states have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

events related to extreme weather delays caused the department of transportation to promulgate regulations imposing potentially severe financial penalties upon airlines that have flights experiencing extended tarmac delays these regulations could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances 

future regulatory action concerning climate change aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the united states while enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until april 2014 if fully implemented we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the european union other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion in addition a security breach in which passenger or employee data is exposed could result in disruption to our operations damage to our reputation and significant costs 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which resulted in industrywide liquidity issues potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security including as a result of our global operations insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

 18 

reductions in coverage or lack of access to war risk insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly 1 reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims from acts of terrorism war or similar events and 2 increased the premiums for such coverage since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the us secretary of transportation has extended coverage through september 30 2014 and we expect the coverage to be further extended the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism or may result in a material increase to our operating expense

 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

  

in may june and july 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the us district courts for the northern district of georgia the middle district of florida and the district of nevada against delta and airtran airways “airtran” in these cases the plaintiffs originally alleged that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtrans ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag deltas imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtrans imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the first bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the northern district of georgia by the multidistrict litigation “mdl” panel 

in february 2010 the plaintiffs in the mdl proceeding filed a consolidated amended class action complaint which substantially expanded the scope of the original complaint in the consolidated amended complaint the plaintiffs added new allegations concerning alleged signaling by both delta and airtran based upon statements made to the investment community by both carriers relating to industry capacity levels during 20082009 the plaintiffs also added a new cause of action against delta alleging attempted monopolization in violation of section 2 of the sherman act paralleling a claim previously asserted against airtran but not delta 

in august 2010 the district court issued an order granting deltas motion to dismiss the section 2 claim but denying its motion to dismiss the section 1 claim plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify the section 1 class which remains pending delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits 

eu regulation 261 class action litigation 

in february 2011 a putative class action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois seeking to represent all us residents who were passengers on flights during the period from february 2009 to the present who are allegedly entitled to compensation under eu regulation 261 because their flight was cancelled or delayed by more than 3 hours plaintiffs allege that delta has incorporated a duty to pay this compensation into its contract of carriage and assert a claim for breach of contract as the basis for their cause of action the complaint seeks recovery of the eu regulation 261 compensation of €600 for each us resident on a flight qualifying for such compensation in october 2013 the district court granted delta’s motion to dismiss all claims with prejudice the plaintiffs have filed an appeal to the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit which remains pending delta disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend the matter

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results   of operations 

financial highlights  2013  compared to 2012   

our net income for 2013 was 105 billion which reflects 80 billion of income tax benefits primarily due to the release of the tax valuation allowance income before income taxes was 25 billion representing a 15 billion improvement over prior year our pretax operating margin rose by 4 percentage points to 7 on both higher revenues and lower costs 

2013 was a successful year for delta based on several measures our pretax profits were 147 higher than the prior year our operating performance led the industry driving customer satisfaction and doubling our domestic net promoter scores a metric measuring customer satisfaction our completion factor was 997 with over 70 days where none of our flights were canceled we ranked number two in the industry for bag performance as measured by the us department of transportation during the year we returned over 350 million to our shareholders through dividends and a share purchase program we also rejoined the standard  poors 500 index of large companies 

revenue  our passenger revenue increased 12 billion despite a lower market price of fuel we experienced positive market reaction to our first class upsell and economy comfort products our customers value these products which together contributed more than 600 million in revenues our geographic regions performed well compared to the prior year with the domestic region leading yearoveryear unit revenue improvement unit revenues of the domestic region rose by over 5 with notable improvements in the new york market new york unit revenues increased as we continue to see improvements due to our investments in jfk and laguardia as well as many inflight product enhancements revenues related to our international regions were generally flat yearoveryear with slight unit revenue improvements in both atlantic and latin america regions our pacific region experienced a slight decline in unit revenues primarily due to the yen devaluation 

operating expense  total operating expense decreased 122 million  from 2012 as a result our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile casm for 2013 decreased 1  to 1477 cent s from 1497 cent s in 2012 on a 1 increase in capacity casmex a nongaap financial measure was 914 cent s in 2013 or 2  higher than 2012 

changes in our total operating expenses reflect decreased fuel expense offset by higher salaries and related costs and profit sharing fuel expense for 2013 was 115 billion  including regional carriers our average price per gallon was 300 which was 025 lower than 2012 our average price per gallon adjusted was 307  a nongaap financial measure which was 019  lower than 2012 our fuel cost includes net airline segment fuel hedge gains for the year of 444 million and a loss on refinery operations of 116 million or 003 per gallon the higher salaries expense represents wage increases and shows the continued investment we are making in our employees delta relies on its employees for its operational and financial success as a result of our success in 2013 we will pay our employees record profit sharing of 506 million which represents over 8 of an employees annual pay and is a 36 yearoveryear increase 

income tax  we have released the tax valuation allowance that placed a reserve against certain tax assets we now believe that given the companys financial performance we will be able to use these tax assets to offset future cash income tax liabilities we recognized an 80 billion tax benefit primarily as a result of releasing the valuation which was recorded in income tax benefit provision in our consolidated statement of operations beginning in 2014 we expect to record income tax expense with an effective rate of approximately 38 as of december 31 2013 we have more than 15 billion of net operating loss carryforwards nols that will be used to offset cash income taxes due on future earnings 

the nongaap financial measure casmex used in this section is defined and reconciled in supplemental information below average fuel price per gallon adjusted is defined and reconciled in results of operations  year ended 2013 and 2012  operating expense below 

company initiatives 

increasing shareholder value 

we continue to focus on cash flow generation with the goal of further strengthening our balance sheet we finished 2013  with 57 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and undrawn revolving credit facility capacity during 2013 we generated 45 billion  in cash from operating activities reduced debt by 14 billion  and funded capital expenditures of 26 billion and returned 350 million to shareholders while maintaining a solid liquidity position 

 27 

in may 2013 we announced a plan to return more than 1 billion  to shareholders over the next three years as part of this plan our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend program and declared a 006  per share dividend for shareholders of record as of august 9 2013  and november 6 2013 these dividends were paid in september 2013  and november 2013 and each totaled 51 million  in addition the board of directors authorized a 500 million  share repurchase program to be completed no later than june 30 2016  during 2013  we repurchased and retired approximately 10 million shares at a cost of approximately 250 million  on february 7 2014 our board of directors declared a 006 dividend for shareholders of record on february 21 2014 and payable on march 14 2014 

network strategy 

we are implementing several strategies that are designed to strengthen and expand our global network and presence these include our investment in and joint venture with virgin atlantic improvements at our hubs at laguardia and jfk in new york and the creation of an international gateway in seattle 

virgin atlantic investment  in 2013 we purchased a 49 interest in virgin atlantic from singapore airlines for 360 million we also entered into an agreement with virgin atlantic with respect to operations on nonstop routes between the united kingdom and north america in september 2013 the us department of transportation granted antitrust immunity on these routesthe antitrust immunized relationship allows for joint marketing and sales coordinated pricing and revenue management network planning and scheduling with respect to operations on routes between north america and the united kingdom virgin atlantic has a significant presence at londons heathrow airport the airport of choice for business travelers traveling to and from london along with our state of the art facility at jfk we believe our relationship with virgin atlantic will provide our customers with superior service and connectivity between new york and london beginning january 1 2014 we began working under the immunized relationship and published our first coordinated schedule that becomes effective april 2014 

laguardia during december 2011 we closed transactions with us airways in which we received takeoff and landing rights each a slot pair at laguardia in exchange for slot pairs at reagan national this exchange allowed us to create a new domestic hub at laguardia we have increased capacity at laguardia by approximately 50 since march 2012 adding 123 new flights and a total of 31 new destinations we currently operate about 277 daily flights between laguardia and 65 cities more than any other airline 

we are investing approximately 200 million in a renovation and expansion project at laguardia to enhance the customer experience in 2012 we opened the connector linking terminals c and d and a new skyclub in terminal c we are also expanding security lanes and a baggage handling system in both terminals as well as an enhanced skyclub in terminal d 

jfk while our expanded laguardia schedule is focused on providing industryleading domestic service we are optimizing our international and transcontinental flight schedule and undertaking a redevelopment project at jfk to facilitate convenient connections for our passengers and improve coordination with our skyteam alliance partners prior to beginning the redevelopment project we primarily operated domestic flights out of terminal 2 and international flights out of terminal 3 our initial fiveyear project to expand and enhance terminal 4 which began in 2010 is on schedule we have constructed nine new international gates in terminal 4 which opened in 2013 we have relocated our operations from terminal 3 to our newly constructed facilities at terminal 4 and have begun the demolition of terminal 3 during 2013 we announced plans for an additional 180 million expansion project that will add 11 more gates at terminal 4 with the additional expansion we will relocate our regional jet operations from terminal 2 to terminal 4 we expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance including reduced taxi times and better ontime performance 

seattle international gateway expansion seattle is one of delta’s fastestgrowing international gateways we have recently expanded service in seattle with additional frequencies and destinations both domestically and internationally we have invested in our facilities including a renovated lobby a new delta skyclub and many other customer enhancements by expanding in seattle we will have improved service for our local customers and increased connection into asia 

maintaining cost performance 

beginning in 2012 we implemented a cost initiatives program which is expected to stem the rate of cost growth to less than 2 cost inflation annually these initiatives are designed to improve our cost efficiency while maintaining our operational performance and revenue generation an important component is the fleet restructuring initiative to retire older less efficient aircraft from our fleet 

 28 

fleet restructuring 

fleet restructuring is an important component of our cost initiatives and is focused on lowering unit costs while investing in our fleet to enhance the customer experience we are restructuring our domestic fleet by reducing our 50seat regional flying and replacing other older less cost effective aircraft with newer more efficient aircraft agreements with skywest airlines inc and bombardier aerospace as well as our acquisition of endeavor have produced a path for us to eliminate more than 200 50seat aircraft we are replacing these aircraft and older b757200 aircraft with more efficient and customer preferred crj900 b717200 and b737900er aircraft 

 

 

 

in addition we entered into an agreement in september 2013 with airbus to purchase 10 international capable widebody a330300 and 30 large narrowbody a321200 aircraft expected to serve domestic markets delivery of the first a330300 aircraft is expected to occur in spring 2015 with three additional a330300 aircraft expected to be delivered in 2015 four aircraft in 2016 and two in 2017 delivery of three a321200 aircraft are scheduled for the first quarter of 2016 with 12 additional aircraft expected to be delivered later in 2016 and 15 in 2017 

as mentioned above an important component of the fleet restructuring initiative is to reduce 50seat crj aircraft which are our least fuel efficient aircraft and have the lowest customer satisfaction ratings we are targeting a fleet size of 100 to 125 aircraft within the next two years our current fleet includes aircraft we lease and aircraft that are operated for us by regional carriers that own or lease aircraft through third parties as part of the reduction we will retire a significant portion of the fleet that is leased by us we expect to continue to recognize material restructuring charges representing the remaining obligations under the leases as we retire the leased aircraft although many factors could change over the next two years we currently estimate that future charges will be between 200 million to 300 million in addition to the 107 million recorded in 2013 the timing and amount of these charges will depend on a number of factors including our final negotiations with lessors the timing of removing aircraft from service and the ultimate disposition of aircraft included in the fleet restructuring program also to accelerate the restructuring of the fleet we may park a portion of the fleet on a temporary basis until contracts for aircraft flying under contract carrier agreements expire the temporarily parked aircraft will be returned to service as aircraft flying under these expiring agreements exit the fleet we will continue to incur operating lease expense for these temporarily parked aircraft as a result of restructuring the fleet we expect to benefit from improved operational and fuel efficiency customer service and reduced future maintenance cost that we will experience over the life of the new aircraft 

fuel expense including refinery results 

fuel expense  fuel expense is our largest expense representing 33 of total operating expenses for 2013 our total fuel expense decreased 787 million  including our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements compared to 2012 this decrease is primarily due to reduced market jet fuel prices and an increase in gains from our hedging activities excluding marktomarket adjustments on hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period mtm adjustments our fuel price per gallon adjusted a nongaap financial measure for 2013 was 307  per gallon compared to 326  per gallon in 2012 

the market volatility of jet fuel prices greatly impacts our fuel costs we manage our fuel cost through three primary methods purchase agreements fuel hedging and the operation of a refinery 

 29 

fuel purchase cost   the market price per gallon of jet fuel decreased 4  compared to 2012 which lowered our purchase cost of fuel this decrease was partially offset by a 2  increase in consumption on higher capacity 

fuel hedging program impact   we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel during 2013 our consolidated fuel hedge gain was 493 million  this hedge gain included 276 million  of mtm adjustments these mtm adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period 

refinery segment impact   global jet fuel demand continues to increase while the advent of shale oil production in the us has reduced the threat of us refinery closures beyond those that have already closed further capacity reduction is expected in europe thus impacting supply in the atlantic basin and ultimately increasing refinery margins in the us our whollyowned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively “monroe” operate the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin we are paying the facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk 

the refinery produces primarily gasoline diesel and jet fuel under multiyear agreements we are effectively exchanging the nonjet fuel products with phillips 66 and bp for jet fuel to be used in our airline operations the refinery produced approximately 162000 barrels per day in 2013 the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 150000 barrels per day for use in airline operations during 2013 

a refinery is subject to us environmental protection agency epa requirements that are established each year to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and onroad diesel fuel it produces alternatively a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits called rins from third parties in the secondary market 

because the refinery operated by monroe does not blend renewable fuels it must purchase its entire rins requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the epa the refinery is exposed to the market price of rins for example the average historical price of ethanol rins ranged from 002 to 005 per rin in prior years but the market price increased to over 140 per rin during 2013 the price at december 31 2013 was 034 per rin compliance with the rins requirement by purchasing rins if available in the secondary market at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows for 2014 we recognized 64 million of expense related to the rins requirement in 2013 which is included in the refinerys results we believe that holders of rins have been withholding them from the secondary market this reduction of available rins significantly impairs the secondary market as a means of compliance with the rins requirement therefore the company is pursuing legal regulatory and legislative solutions to this problem 

the refinery recorded a loss of 116 million in 2013 the refinerys results were impacted by the cost of rins that far exceeded their historical averages as discussed above in addition we believe that the increase in jet fuel supply due to the refinerys operation has decreased the overall market price of jet fuel and lowered our cost of jet fuel

results of operations  2013  compared to 2012   

operating revenue 





passenger revenue passenger revenue increased 12 billion  or 4  on a 3  prasm increase and a 3  increase in passenger mile yield revenue remained strong despite lower fuel prices in addition the increase in passenger revenue reflects the investments for inflight product enhancements such as the economy comfort product and higher corporate sales 

our geographic regions performed well compared to the prior year with the domestic region leading yearoveryear unit revenue improvement as a result of higher passenger mile yield unit revenues of the domestic region rose by over 5 with notable improvements in the new york market new york unit revenues increased as we continue to see improvements due to our investments in jfk and laguardia as well as many inflight product enhancements revenues related to our international regions were generally flat yearoveryear with slight unit revenue improvements in both atlantic and latin america regions our pacific region experienced a slight decline in unit revenues primarily due to the yen devaluation 

 31 

operating expense 



1   nm  not meaningful for a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items see note 16  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel expense including regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements fuel expense decreased 787 million  because of a 4  decrease in fuel market price per gallon and fuel hedge gains partially offset by a 2  increase in consumption the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedging and the refinery 



 

the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon adjusted 



 32 

fuel purchase cost  fuel purchase cost is based on the market price for jet fuel at airport locations 

refinery impact  the refinery results include the impact on fuel expense of selfsupply from the production of the refinery and from refined products exchanged with phillips 66 and bp as described in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent that we account for exchanges of refined products as nonmonetary transactions we include the results of those transactions within fuel expense 

fuel hedge gains losses and mtm adjustments  during the year ended december 31 2013 our airline segment fuel hedge gains of 444 million  included 276 million  of mtm adjustments these mtm adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period the gains for mtm adjustments are reflected in the table above to calculate an effective fuel cost for the period 

we adjust fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost our average price per gallon adjusted a nongaap financial measure was 307  for the year ended december 31 2013 

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to employee pay increases 

during the june 2012 quarter we reached an agreement with alpa that increases pay and benefits for our pilots our pilots and substantially all other employees received base pay increases on july 1 2012 and received additional increases on january 1 2013 these increases are designed both to recognize changes to the profit sharing program described below and to accelerate the planned 2013 pay increase for nonpilot employees 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business the decrease in maintenance costs is primarily due to lower volume of sales to third parties of our mro services and the cyclical timing of maintenance events on our fleet 

contracted services contracted services expense increased yearoveryear due primarily to the impact of severe winter storms on our operations and costs associated with the 1 increase in capacity 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased yearoveryear primarily due to our investment in the purchase of aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering 

landing fees and other rents landing fees and other rents increased yearoveryear primarily due to our investment in airport facilities 

profit sharing  our broad based employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the terms of the program specify the exclusion of special items such as mtm adjustments and restructuring and other items from pretax profit during the june 2012 quarter our profit sharing program was modified so that we will pay 10 of profits on the first 25 billion of annual profits effective with the plan year beginning january 1 2013 compared to paying 15 of annual profits for the 2012 plan year under the program we will continue to pay 20 of annual profits above 25 billion 

aircraft rent aircraft rent decreased yearoveryear due primarily due to purchasing aircraft offlease 

 33 

results of operations  2012  compared to 2011   

operating revenue 





passenger revenue passenger revenue increased 15 billion  or 5  due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield of 5  on a 2  decline in capacity passenger mile yield and unit revenue increased due to fare increases higher revenue under corporate travel contracts and improvements in our products and services 

  

international mainline passenger revenue increased 520 million in early 2011 we faced industry overcapacity in the transatlantic market and in connection with our joint venture partners airfranceklm and alitalia we reduced capacity in underperforming markets during the second half of 2011 and in 2012 as a result atlantic prasm was up 6  driven by a 3  increase in yield on a 7  decrease in capacity pacific passenger revenue increased 11  on a 3  and 6  increase in capacity and traffic respectively these results reflect pacific market improvement as demand returned to levels seen prior to the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan latin america passenger revenue increased 8  on a 3  and 6  increase in capacity and traffic respectively 

 34 

operating expense 



1   for a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items see note 16  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel expense including regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements fuel expense increased 468 million  because of a 6  increase in our average price per gallon despite a 2  decrease in consumption the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedge losses of 66 million  during the year ended december 31 2012 



the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon 



 35 

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to employee pay increases increases in pension expense and other benefits 

during the june 2012 quarter we reached an agreement with alpa that increases pay and benefits for our pilots our pilots and substantially all other employees received base pay increases on july 1 2012 and received additional increases on january 1 2013 these increases are designed both to recognize changes to the profit sharing program described below and to accelerate the planned 2013 pay increase for nonpilot employees 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business the increase in maintenance costs is primarily due to the cyclical timing of maintenance events on our fleet additionally maintenance cost increased as we accelerated certain maintenance events into 2012 resulting in a lower total cost for those activities and completed maintenance initiatives to improve our operational reliability 

passenger commissions and other selling expenses the decrease in passenger commissions and other selling expenses is primarily due to lower booking fees and international commission rates partially offset by increases in sales 

contracted services contracted services expense decreased yearoveryear due primarily to the impact of severe winter storms on our operations in the march 2011 quarter 

profit sharing  our broad based employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the terms of the program specify the exclusion of special items such as mtm adjustments and restructuring and other items from pretax profit during the june 2012 quarter our profit sharing program was modified so that we will pay 10 of profits on the first 25 billion of annual profits effective with the plan year beginning january 1 2013 compared to paying 15 of annual profits for the 2012 plan year under the program we will continue to pay 20 of annual profits above 25 billion 

 36 

nonoperating results 



the decline in interest expense net is driven by reduced levels of debt and lower interest rates our principal amount of debt has declined from 154 billion at the beginning of 2011 to 112 billion  at december 31 2013  during 2012 and 2011 we recorded 118 million  and 68 million  in losses from the early extinguishment of debt which primarily related to the writeoff of debt discounts these debt discounts are primarily a result of fair value adjustments recorded in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of northwest longterm debt due to purchase accounting as a result of these writeoffs and scheduled amortization our unamortized debt discount has decreased from 935 million at the beginning of 2011 to 383 million  at december 31 2013  

income taxes 

we consider all income sources including other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations the following table shows the components of our income tax benefit provision 



during the december 2013 quarter after considering all relevant factors we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized accordingly at december 31 2013 we released almost all of our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets the release of the allowance primarily resulted in a net tax benefit of 80 billion  that was recorded in income tax benefit provision in our consolidated statement of operations beginning in 2014 we expect to record income tax expense with an effective rate of approximately 38 at december 31 2013  we had 153 billion  of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards accordingly we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years our us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2023  see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

during 2012 and 2011 we did not record an income tax provision for us federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets were fully reserved by a valuation allowance during 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit of 85 million primarily related to the recognition of alternative minimum tax refunds 

 37 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2013  we had 57 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 38 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 19 billion  in undrawn revolving credit facilities 

sources of liquidity 

operating cash flow 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated positive cash flows from operations of 45 billion  in 2013  25 billion in 2012  and 28 billion in 2011  we also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2014 

our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date and receive cash payment at the time of sale as a result we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the spring as we have increased sales in advance of the summer peak travel season our cash balances are typically higher at the beginning of the summer and at a low point during the winter 

fuel and fuel hedge margins  the cost of jet fuel is our most significant expense representing approximately 33  of our total operating expenses for 2013  the market price for jet fuel is highly volatile and can vary significantly from period to period this price volatility affects our cash flows from operations impacting comparability from period to period 

we have jet fuel inventories at various airport locations which are used in our airline operations also we acquired the trainer oil refinery in 2012 which as part of refinery operations has refined oil product inventories jet fuel and refined oil product inventories are recorded as fuel inventory fuel inventory increased during 2012 as a result of the start up of refinery operations in the september quarter and the transition of our fuel supply program the increase in fuel inventory to achieve normal operating levels at our refinery was offset by a similar increase in accounts payable and therefore did not have a significant impact on operating cash flows during 2012 the remaining 180 million increase in fuel inventory was a result of the transition in deltas fuel supply program 

as part of our fuel hedging program we may be required to pay hedge margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position conversely if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position we may receive hedge margin our future cash flows are impacted depending upon the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying our derivative contracts 

timing of skymiles sales  in december 2011 we amended our american express agreements and agreed to sell 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles to american express in each december from 2011 through 2014 under the december 2011 amendment american express purchased 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 in 2011 this operating cash flow was largely offset by working capital changes we anticipate american express will make an additional purchase of 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles in 2014 

in 2008 we entered into a multiyear extension of our american express agreements and received 10 billion from american express for an advance purchase of restricted skymiles the agreement as modified provided that our obligations with respect to the advance purchase would be satisfied as american express uses the purchased miles over a specified future period “skymiles usage period” during the skymiles usage period which commenced in december 2011 american express utilized skymiles valued at 333 million annually over three years beginning 2012 instead of paying cash to delta for skymiles used this draw down of 333 million in skymiles reduced cash flows from operations in 2012 compared to 2011 in december 2013 we and american express amended this agreement to allow american express to use these skymiles immediately and without restriction 

 38 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the the pension protection act of 2006 we contributed 914 million  in 2013 including 250 million  above the minimum funding levels 697 million in 2012 and 598 million in 2011 to our defined benefit pension plans we estimate the funding under these plans will total approximately 925 million  in 2014 including 250 million  above the minimum funding requirements 

undrawn lines of credit 

we have available 19 billion  in undrawn lines of credit as described in note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have an undrawn 12 billion firstlien revolving credit facility as part of our 2011 credit facilities the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in april 2016 

we also have an undrawn 450 million revolving credit facility included in the 2012 pacific facilities as described in note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the 2012 pacific facilities are secured by our pacific routes and slots this revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in october 2017 in addition we have undrawn bank revolving credit facilities of 250 million 

the credit facilities mentioned above have covenants such as collateral coverage ratios if we are not in compliance with these covenants we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and may not be able to draw on the revolving credit facilities 

other 

    our ability to obtain additional financing if needed on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that a significant portion of our assets are subject to liens 

investing and financing 

investing activities   

we incurred capital expenditures of 26 billion in 2013  20 billion in 2012  and 13 billion in 2011  our capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering also during 2013 we purchased a 49  equity investment in virgin atlantic for 360 million  

we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft we expect that we will invest approximately 23 billion in 2014 primarily for aircraft and aircraft modifications we expect that the 2014 investments will be funded through cash from operations and new financings 

financings 

at december 31 2013  total debt and capital leases including current maturities was 113 billion  a 14 billion  reduction from december 31 2012  and a 59 billion reduction from december 31 2009 we have focused on reducing our total debt over the past few years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet in addition we have refinanced previous financing transactions which we expect to reduce our total future interest expense 

in may 2013 we announced a plan to return more than 1 billion  to shareholders over the next three years as part of this plan our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend program and declared a 006  per share dividend in both august 2013 and november 2013 these dividends were paid in september 2013  and november 2013 and each totaled 51 million  in addition the board of directors authorized a 500 million  share repurchase program to be completed no later than june 30 2016  during 2013  we repurchased and retired approximately 10 million shares at a cost of approximately 250 million  

in 2013 we received 268 million in financing proceeds from longterm debt which is secured by aircraft delivered in 2013 in 2012 we received 480 million in financing proceeds from longterm debt secured by aircraft previously financed by debt in 2012 we also refinanced 17 billion in debt and undrawn revolving credit facilities secured by our pacific routes and slots which resulted in a lower interest rate 

 39 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2013  that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments which are generally ordinary course of business obligations that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 



  

 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt

aircraft purchase commitments represents our commitments to purchase 88  b737900er 30  a321200 28  crj900 18  b7878 aircraft and 10  a330300 aircraft our purchase commitment for 18  b7878 aircraft provides for certain aircraft substitution rights 

contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying 

employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our employee benefit obligations see “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

other obligations represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other third party services and products additionally other obligations includes estimates of lease payments on the remaining 75 b717200 aircraft still to be delivered in 2014 and 2015 from the agreements entered into in 2012 with southwest airlines and boeing to lease 88 b717200 aircraft

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” offers incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements and airlines that participate in the skymiles program as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines 

the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below these are 1 passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and 2 the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with two deliverables 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation  we value each deliverable on a standalone basis our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers and is reevaluated at least annually we use established ticket prices to determine the standalone selling price of air transportation we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 

we defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused  a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately 50 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of mileage credits   customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables as defined below 

our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express in september 2013 we and american express modified our skymiles agreements this modification required that we use a different accounting standard for recording skymiles sold prior to the modifications we allocated consideration received from selling miles to american express among two primary deliverables credit redeemable for future travel and marketing deliverables we deferred revenue related to the portion of mileage credits redeemable for future travel based on the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines we calculated the value of the marketing component based on the residual method and recognize it as other revenue as related marketing services are provided   

the september 2013 modifications introduced new deliverables and modified existing deliverables because these modifications were material to the skymiles agreements we are required to use a different accounting standard that allocates the consideration received from selling miles to all deliverables based on their relative standalone sales price accordingly we determined our best estimate of selling prices by considering discounted cash flows analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions including 1 the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 2 the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines 3 published rates on our website for baggage fees access to delta skyclub lounges and other benefits while traveling on delta and 4 brand value the effect of this change in accounting standard lowered the deferral rate we use to record miles sold under the agreements which increases revenue we will record in future periods the revenue impact of the skymiles agreement modifications was insignificant for 2013 and is expected to increase 2014 revenue by approximately 100 million  additionally upon application of this accounting standard we were required to adjust the recorded value of miles currently deferred in our frequent flyer liability that originated through the american express programs accordingly we adjusted the liability in the september 2013 quarter by less than 10 million  

 41 

breakage for mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed management uses statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years  at december 31 2013  the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 44 billion  a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 28 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2013  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 we assess our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets under a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider many market factors including those listed under key assumptions below we analyze these market factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below if the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering market capitalization and other factors when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 a combination of limited market transactions and the lease savings method for certain airport slots which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates 3 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 4 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions  the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 our projected revenues expenses and cash flows 2 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 3 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 4 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates  in addition we consider the amount the intangible assets fair value exceeded their carrying value in the most recent fair value measurement using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 an increase in fuel prices 3 declining passenger mile yields 4 lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened us and global economy 5 interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons and 6 changes to the regulatory environment 

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset the impact of fuel prices and other airline input costs the stabilizing operating environment for us airlines has resulted in annual yields increasing along with load factors leading to improved financial results 

goodwill our goodwill balance was 98 billion  at december 31 2013  we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets had a net carrying amount of 47 billion  at december 31 2013  indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements 

in 2013 we determined that there was no indication that our indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired based upon our assessments these assessments included analyses and weighting of all relevant factors including the significant inputs and key assumptions which impact the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets 

 42 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 219 billion  at december 31 2013  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we record impairment losses on flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircrafts carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

income tax valuation allowance 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets we establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our future projections of sustained profitability deferred income tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results our industrys historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies  we recorded a full valuation allowance in 2004 due to our cumulative loss position at that time compounded by the negative industrywide business trends and outlook at december 31 2012 we had an 110 billion valuation allowance established against our deferred income tax assets which represented a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets 

for 2012 we recorded a pretax profit of 10 billion and during 2012 we moved from a threeyear cumulative loss position to a cumulative income position for the first time since we established the full valuation allowance however given the industrys recent history of significant losses we concluded as of december 31 2012 that another year of significant profitability was needed to support a release of valuation allowance 

during 2013 we continued our trend of sustained profitability recording a pretax profit of 25 billion for the year during the december 2013 quarter after considering all relevant factors we concluded that our deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred net assets the significant relevant factors that we considered are 1 our recent history of profitability 2 growth in the us and global economies 3 forecast of airline revenue trends 4 estimate of future fuel prices and 5 future impact of taxable temporary differences accordingly at december 31 2013 we released almost all of our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets primarily resulting in the 80 billion benefit in our provision for income taxes 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals  as of december 31 2013  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 101 billion  during 2013  we contributed 914 million  to these plans and recorded 354 million  of expense in salaries and related costs on our consolidated statement of operations in 2014 we estimate we will contribute approximately 925 million  to these plans including 250 million  of contributions above the minimum funding requirements and that our expense will be approximately 230 million the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

 43 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 501  and 411  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 410  to 570  between 2013 and 2011 

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data   modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets   we review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually   our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation   our actual historical annualized three and five year rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans was approximately 9  and 12  respectively as of december 31 2013  the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to use a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target   our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended   december 31 2013  was 9 

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen delta elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an   885   discount rate   

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk 

is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an 

effort to manage our exposure to these risks we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as 

market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in 

earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

changes in aircraft fuel prices materially impact our results of operations   we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel   we utilize several different contract and commodity types in this program and   frequently test its economic effectiveness against our financial targets   we rebalance the hedge portfolio from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  

our fuel hedge portfolio consists of call options put options combinations of two or more call options and put options swap contracts and futures contracts   the products underlying the hedge contracts include crude oil diesel fuel and jet fuel as these commodities are highly correlated with the price of jet fuel that we consume  our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices change significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin we may adjust our hedge portfolio from time to time in response to margin posting requirements 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  aircraft fuel and related taxes including our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements accounted for 115 billion  or 33  of our total operating expense we recognized 493 million  of net fuel hedge gains during the year ended december 31 2013  including 276 million  of marktomarket gains primarily relating to hedge contracts settling in future periods 

the following table shows the projected cash impact to fuel cost assuming 10 and 20 increases or decreases in fuel prices the hedge gain loss reflects the change in the projected cash settlement value of our open fuel hedge contracts at december 31 2013  based on their contract settlement dates assuming the same 10 and 20 changes 



 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

 47 

at december 31 2013  we had 49 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 63 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 210 million at december 31 2013  and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 44 million exclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge contracts 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2013  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a 257 million  asset position we estimate that a 10 depreciation or appreciation in the price of the japanese yen and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 80 million gain or 100 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2014

our contractual agreements with regional carriers primarily are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our “dl” designator code and we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail and inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

a portion of the flights operated for us by skywest airlines are structured as revenue proration agreements these proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

general 

jet fuel costs have continued to increase in recent years making fuel expense our single largest expense we have historically purchased most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

monroe energy 

because global demand for jet fuel and related products is increasing at the same time that jet fuel refining capacity is decreasing in the us particularly in the northeast the refining margin reflected in the prices we pay for jet fuel has increased our whollyowned subsidiaries monroe energy llc and mipc llc collectively “monroe” acquired the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania in june 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin we are paying 

refinery acquisition monroe invested 180 million to acquire the refinery from phillips 66 monroe received a 30 million grant from the commonwealth of pennsylvania the acquisition includes pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and john f kennedy international airport jfk prior to the transaction phillips 66 had shut down operations at the refinery 

refinery operations the facility is capable of refining 185000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition to jet fuel the refinerys production consists of gasoline diesel and refined products “nonjet fuel products” production at the refinery restarted in september 2012 bp is the primary supplier of crude oil used by the refinery under a three year agreement we are also exploring other sources of crude oil supply such as bringing supply to the refinery by rail from the bakken oil field in north dakota 

strategic agreements  under a multiyear agreement we are exchanging a significant portion of the nonjet fuel products with phillips 66 for jet fuel to be used in our airline operations substantially all of the remaining production of nonjet fuel products is being sold to bp under a longterm buysell agreement effectively exchanging those nonjet fuel products for jet fuel our agreement with phillips 66 requires us to deliver specified quantities of nonjet fuel products and they are required to deliver jet fuel to us if we or phillips 66 do not have the specified quantity and type of product available the delivering party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement substantially all of the refinerys expected production of nonjet fuel products is included in these agreements 

segments  because the products and services of monroes refinery operations are discrete from our airline services segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment   financial information on our segment reporting can be found in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fuel hedging program 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel  this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types   the economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets the hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates 

fuel supply availability 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel including through our purchases from monroe but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles ®  frequent flyer program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta deltas regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits miles do not expire but are subject to all program rules we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs ® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacitycontrolled seating in 2012  program members redeemed more than 262 billion miles in the skymiles program for 11 million award redemptions during this period 8 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel 

other businesses 

cargo 

through our global network our cargo operations are able to connect all of the worlds major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets primarily through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance whose other members are aeroflot aeromexico cargo air franceklm cargo alitalia cargo china airlines cargo china southern cargo czech airlines cargo and korean air cargo skyteam cargo offers a global network spanning six continents 

delta techops delta global services mlt vacations and delta private jets 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” staffing services for third parties vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations in 2012 the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 1 billion 

   

 

 

 

distribution and expanded product offerings 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including telephone reservations deltacom global distribution systems and online travel agencies an increasing number of our tickets are sold through deltacom which reduces our distribution costs and gives us closer contact with our customers we launched a new deltacom platform in november 2012 which we expect will result in additional purchases of tickets and services through that channel 

we are transforming distribution from a commodity approach to a differentiated and merchandised approach we expect that the merchandising initiatives we are implementing primarily through deltacom will generate additional revenue opportunities for us and will improve the experience of our customers we provide our customers with opportunities to purchase what they value such as first class upgrades economy comfort seating wifi access and skyclub passes we expect to benefit from increased traffic on deltacom through a combination of advertising revenue and sales of third party merchandise and services such as car rentals hotels and trip insurance 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs the industry is going through a period of transformation through consolidation both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years including through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization american airlines is nearing the end of its bankruptcy restructuring which is enabling it to reduce its costs our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk and salt lake city either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada all nippon airways and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways iberia qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets 

increased competition has also emerged from wellfunded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad and qatar these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the united states from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and latin america are government supported or funded which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines in addition the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties that the us has with the member states of the european union japan and the gulf states could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic joint venture with air franceklm and alitalia and our transpacific joint venture with virgin australia have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american and japan air lines 

regulatory matters 

the department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia john f kennedy international airport “jfk” and newark in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons gatwick and heathrow airports and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

emissions  the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date the icao has adopted two additional aircraft engine emissions standards the first of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 and the second of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2013 in june 2012 the epa published a final rulemaking for new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen nox adopting icaos additional standards included in the rule are two new tiers of more stringent emission standards for nox   these standards referred to as the tier 6 standards become effective for newlymanufactured aircraft engines beginning in 2013 

concern about aviation environmental issues including climate change and greenhouse gases has led to taxes on our operations in the united kingdom and in germany both of which have levied taxes directly on our customers we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the united states and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions this could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations ongoing bilateral discussions between the united states and other nations as well as discussions at the icao assembly and conference of the parties most recently in doha qatar in december 2012 may lead to international treaties or other actions focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation 

the european union has required its member states to implement regulations including aviation in its emissions trading scheme “ets” under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union is subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 is required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets in november 2012 the european commission proposed to defer airlines compliance obligations for noneuropean flights and suspended related noncompliance sanctions until after the 38th icao assembly to be held in late september and early october of 2013 the european commission has taken this action to give the process at icao time to come to a conclusion under the proposal airlines will not face enforcement action if they do not surrender allowances for their emissions related to flights operated to and from noneu destinations however all intraeu flights on any carrier based in the eu or not will still have to comply with the requirements of the ets legislation is required to implement this proposed change and a codecision by both the eu member states and the european parliament on this change is necessary a decision is expected before april 2013 further at the end of november 2012 the united state government enacted legislation exempting us airlines from the ets 

cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the united states in addition other legislative or regulatory action including by the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible in particular the epa has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the us or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the european union where we operate or where we  may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

we seek to minimize the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts and have realized reductions in our greenhouse gas emission levels since 2005 we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain elements of our fleet and with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national  air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

refinery matters  monroes operation of the trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and  greenhouse gas emissions if monroe violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations monroe could be fined or otherwise sanctioned which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for environmental matters for monroe 

other environmental matters  we had been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and entered into consent decrees or settlements regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites was small or was considered de minimis  when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site 

we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and aircraft drinking water 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international longrange aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2013 we have also committed aircraft to international shortrange requirements the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 50 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 74000  fulltime equivalent employees approximately 15  of whom were represented by unions the following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions 



in addition 220  refinery employees of monroe are represented by the united steel workers under an agreement that expires on february 26 2015 this agreement is governed by the national labor relations act which generally allows either party to engage in selfhelp upon the expiration of the agreement 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our operating subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes

 item 1a risk factors   

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases including in the cost of crude oil could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been extremely volatile during the last several years in 2012  our average fuel price per gallon was 325  a 6  increase from our average fuel price in 2011 in 2011 our average fuel price per gallon was 306  a 31  increase from our average fuel price in 2010 in 2010 our average fuel price per gallon was 233  an 8 increase from an average fuel price of 215  in 2009 which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 36  36  and 30  of our operating expense in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry we often have not been able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future this is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel a significant increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase 

we expect to acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our whollyowned subsidiary monroe and through strategic agreements that monroe has with bp and phillips 66 the cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements will remain subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel in addition we will continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from monroe our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

our business and results of operations are also dependent on the availability of aircraft fuel significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel including from our whollyowned subsidiary would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation taxes or marketing environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in crude oil and fuel supply shortages in the future shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

because we plan to acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from monroe the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil work stoppages relating to organized labor issues or damage from severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters including acts of terrorism if the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition in addition the financial benefits we expect to achieve from buying fuel from monroe could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

under a strategic agreement that monroe has with phillips 66 monroe is exchanging nonjet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of nonjet fuel products to phillips 66 and phillips 66 is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us if either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the exchange agreements if the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations 

in addition the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged if monroes cost of producing the nonjet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our fuel hedging activities are intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our shortterm liquidity 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel  this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types the economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets the hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates and may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin which could have a material adverse impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

our funding obligation with respect to defined benefit pension plans we   sponsor is significant and can vary materially because of changes in   investment asset returns and values 

as of december 31 2012  our defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately 215 billion  and were funded through assets with a value of approximately 82 billion  the benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates neither of which is in our control we estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plans which are governed by erisa and have been frozen for future accruals is approximately 675 million  in 2013 estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control including among other things the market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations 

our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 

we have substantial indebtedness which could 

 in addition a substantial level of indebtedness particularly because a significant portion of our assets are currently subject to liens could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business these liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions industry trends performance and many other factors not within our control 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements and indentures include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time which may be reflected in appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures these changes could result from factors that are not under our control a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 

the credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders or the trustee could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and our cash may become restricted we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our   operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2012  approximately 15  of our workforce was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted monroes relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the national labor relations act nlra which generally allows selfhelp after a collective bargaining agreement expires 

if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act or the nlra as the case may be strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in amsterdam cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city and tokyonarita each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks mobile device applications and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively because of the rapid pace of new developments these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected 

disruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise customer information and expose us to liability possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer 

any internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third party locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

in addition as a part of our ordinary business operations we collect and store sensitive data including personal information of our customers and employees the secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy any compromise of our technology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information any such loss disclosure misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage our reputation any or all of which could adversely affect our business 

our primary credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances the initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards our primary credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash if circumstances were to occur that would allow american express or our visamastercard processor to initiate a holdback the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability in the event that the insurance that we carry to cover damages arising from future accidents is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business 

our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality which can cause our results to fluctuate 

our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in fuel consumption to avoid such weather turbulencerelated injuries delays and cancellations any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional   carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including third party carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers to the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to hazards associated with the operation of a refinery by monroe would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

monroes refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations including explosions fires toxic emissions and natural catastrophes monroes insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses costs or liabilities and monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage in addition monroes ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control if monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations 

the operation of a refinery by monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results 

monroes operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions if monroe violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations monroe could be fined or otherwise sanctioned which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for environmental matters for monroe 

if we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation 

in general under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses “nols” to offset future taxable income in general an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders generally 5 shareholders applying certain lookthrough rules increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period generally three years 

as of december 31 2012  delta reported a consolidated federal pretax nol carryforward of approximately 163 billion  both delta and northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code as a result of the merger northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change delta also experienced a subsequent ownership change on december 17 2008 as a result of the merger the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period 

the delta and northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability to utilize prechange nols that were not subject to limitation and could further limit the ability to utilize nols that were already subject to limitation limitations imposed on the ability to use nols to offset future taxable income could cause us federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such nols to expire unused in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes nols generated subsequent to december 17 2008 are not limited 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorklaguardia new yorkjfk and salt lake city either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators 

discount carriers including southwest airtran now owned by southwest jetblue spirit and allegiant have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the united states and on other network carriers in the domestic market in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization american airlines has recently filed for bankruptcy protection which may enable it to substantially reduce its costs our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets 

increased competition has also emerged from wellfunded carriers in the gulf region including emirates etihad and qatar these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the united states from their hubs in the middle east several of these carriers along with carriers from china india and latin america are government supported or funded which has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of us airlines in addition the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties that the us has with the member states of the european union and japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic joint venture with air franceklm and alitalia have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american airlines british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american airlines and japan air lines 

consolidation in the domestic airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax and has recently proposed additional departure fees a ticket tax increase or additional fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast united states have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines in addition the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

events related to extreme weather delays caused the department of transportation to promulgate regulations imposing potentially severe financial penalties upon airlines that have flights experiencing extended tarmac delays these regulations could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances 

future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the united states if fully implemented we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the european union other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion in addition a security breach in which passenger or employee data is exposed could result in disruption to our operations damage to our reputation and significant costs 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which resulted in industrywide liquidity issues potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security including as a result of our global operations insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly 1 reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims from acts of terrorism war or similar events and 2 increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the us secretary of transportation has extended coverage through september 30 2013 and we expect the coverage to be further extended the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially if available such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expense or may not be obtainable at all resulting in an interruption to our operations

ground facilities 

we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta we own our atlanta reservations center other real property in atlanta and the former northwest headquarters building and flight training buildings which are located near the minneapolisst paul international airport other owned facilities include reservations centers in minot north dakota and chisholm minnesota and a data processing center in eagan minnesota we also own property in tokyo including a 13acre site in downtown tokyo and a 33acre land parcel 512room hotel and flight kitchen located near tokyos narita international airport 

we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve at most airports we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other improvements and facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft these leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30 years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports including among others 1 our main atlanta maintenance base 2 our atlanta air cargo facilities and 3 our hangar and air cargo facilities at the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport salt lake city international airport detroit metropolitan international airport minneapolisst paul international airport and seattletacoma international airport our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities including in some cases amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction we also lease marketing ticketing and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms 

in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

the city of atlanta is currently implementing portions of a capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport the cip includes among other things a 9000 foot fullservice runway that opened in may 2006 a new international terminal and gate capacity that opened in may 2012 related airfield improvements new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvementsthe cip will not be complete until at least 2014 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds in partnership with the airlines the airport has initiated the planning of an updated atlanta airport master plan that is targeted for completion in late 2013 and will define and describe the longterm development plans needed to meet future aviation demand in atlanta 

during the december 2010 quarter we began a fiveyear 12 billion redevelopment project at jfk where we currently operate domestic flights primarily at terminal 2 and international flights at terminal 3 and to a lesser extent terminal 4 the expansion and enhancement of terminal 4 which includes the construction of nine new international gates commenced in 2011 and is expected to be open in the spring of 2013 upon completion of the terminal 4 expansion we will relocate our operations from terminal 3 to terminal 4 proceed with the demolition of terminal 3 and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from terminals 2 and 4 for information about special project bonds issued to fund a substantial majority of the project and our 30 year sublease of space in terminal 4 from the operator of terminal 4 see note 5  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2012 we expanded our flight operations at new yorks laguardia airport in terminal c allowing us to accommodate additional flights into laguardia as part of the expansion we are investing more than 160 million to create an expanded main terminal at laguardia in terminals c and d and have built a bridge to link the two terminals 

in 2012 our whollyowned subsidiaries monroe and mipc invested 180 million to acquire the trainer refinery and related assets from phillips 66 monroe received a 30 million grant from the commonwealth of pennsylvania the acquisition includes pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

  

in may june and july 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the us district courts for the northern district of georgia the middle district of florida and the district of nevada against delta and airtran airways “airtran” in these cases the plaintiffs originally alleged that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtrans ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag deltas imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtrans imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the first bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the northern district of georgia by the multidistrict litigation “mdl” panel 

in february 2010 the plaintiffs in the mdl proceeding filed a consolidated amended class action complaint which substantially expanded the scope of the original complaint in the consolidated amended complaint plaintiffs add new allegations concerning alleged signaling by both delta and airtran based upon statements made to the investment community by both carriers relating to industry capacity levels during 20082009 plaintiffs also added a new cause of action against delta alleging attempted monopolization in violation of section 2 of the sherman act paralleling a claim previously asserted against airtran but not delta 

in august 2010 the district court issued an order granting deltas motion to dismiss the section 2 claim but denying its motion to dismiss the section 1 claim plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify the section 1 class which remains pending delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits 

eu regulation 261 class action litigation 

in february 2011 a putative class action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois seeking to represent all us residents who were passengers on flights during the period from february 2009 to the present who are allegedly entitled to compensation under eu regulation 261 because their flight was cancelled or delayed by more than 3 hours plaintiffs allege that delta has incorporated a duty to pay this compensation into its contract of carriage and assert a claim for breach of contract as the basis for their cause of action the complaint seeks recovery of the eu regulation 261 compensation of €600 for each us resident on a flight qualifying for such compensation delta disputes the allegations in the complaint has filed a motion to dismiss all claims and intends to vigorously defend the matter

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results   of operations 

financial highlights  2012  compared to 2011   

our net income for 2012  was 10 billion  or 119  per diluted share total operating revenue increased 16 billion  or 4  over 2011  primarily due to higher passenger revenue due to yield improvement fuel expense including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements increased due to a 6  increase in our average price per gallon despite a 2  decrease in consumption 

passenger revenue increased 16 billion  due to a 5  year over year improvement in passenger mile yield on flat traffic while capacity declined 2  passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm increased 7  over 2011  reflecting higher revenue under corporate travel contracts and improvements in our products and services 

total operating expense increased 14 billion  over 2011  driven primarily by higher fuel expense and salaries and related costs our fuel expense increased 468 million  including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements compared to 2011  due to a 6  increase in our average price per gallon despite a 2  decrease in consumption during 2012 we recorded losses of 66 million  due to changes in the fair value of our fuel hedge portfolio excluding marktomarket adjustments recorded in periods other than the settlement period mtm adjustments our average fuel price for the year was 326  per gallon compared to 305  per gallon for 2011  

our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile casm for 2012  increased 6  to 1497 cent s primarily reflecting increased fuel price for 2012  casmex was 892 cent s or 5  higher than 2011  the nongaap financial measures used in this section are defined in supplemental information below 

company initiatives 

strengthening the balance sheet 

we will continue to focus on cash flow generation with the goal of further strengthening our balance sheet we finished 2012  with 52 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and undrawn revolving credit facility capacity during 2012 we generated 25 billion  in cash from operating activities and reduced debt by 11 billion  and funded capital expenditures while maintaining a solid liquidity position 

structural cost initiatives 

we implemented a 1 billion structural cost initiatives program these initiatives are designed to improve our cost efficiency while maintaining our operational performance and revenue generation and include 

• domestic fleet restructuring to retire older less efficient aircraft from our fleet 

• maintenance redesign focusing on improving our processes and resource management 

• distribution platforms to increase the use of cost effective and valueadded distribution channels such as deltacom 

• staffing efficiency to generate higher productivity levels through technology and improved staffing models and 

• other costs to improve network efficiency and to reduce transportation expense 

we anticipate realizing the benefits of the structural cost initiatives in 2013 with casmex growth moderating in the second half of 2013 and the benefits of the initiatives increasing through 2015 

domestic fleet restructuring 

domestic fleet restructuring is a key part of our structural cost initiatives and is focused on lowering unit costs while investing in our fleet to enhance the customer experience we are restructuring our domestic fleet by reducing our 50seat regional flying and replacing other older less cost effective aircraft with newer more efficient aircraft recent agreements with skywest airlines inc pinnacle airlines inc and bombardier aerospace have produced a path for us to eliminate more than 200 50seat aircraft we are replacing these aircraft and older b757200 aircraft with more efficient and customer preferred crj900 b717200 and b737900er aircraft 

in 2012 we entered into an agreement with bombardier aerospace to purchase 40 crj900 aircraft with 12 deliveries this year and 28 in 2014 also in 2012 we finalized agreements with southwest airlines and the boeing company boeing to lease 88 b717200 aircraft delivery of the aircraft will begin later this year with 16 aircraft scheduled to enter our fleet we will receive 36 aircraft deliveries in each of 2014 and 2015 these b717200 aircraft are 110seat aircraft and will feature new fully upgraded interiors with 12 first class seats 15 economy comfort seats and inflight wifi throughout the cabin 

in 2011 we entered into an agreement with boeing to purchase 100 new fuel efficient b737900er aircraft we will add these aircraft to our fleet between this year and 2018 primarily replacing older b757200 aircraft we expect the b737900er to offer an industry leading customer experience including expanded carryon baggage space and a spacious cabin additionally we continue to increase our md90 fleet with previously owned aircraft that offer a lower total cost of ownership 

as we restructure our fleet and assess our fleet plans we will continue to evaluate older retiring aircraft and related equipment for changes in depreciable life impairment and lease termination costs by 2015 we expect to reduce our 50seat aircraft fleet to 125 aircraft the associated retirement of aircraft will result in material lease termination and other charges over this period we expect to benefit from reduced future maintenance cost and improved operational and fuel efficiency that we will experience over the life of the new aircraft 

oil refinery acquisition 

jet fuel costs have continued to increase in recent years making fuel expense our single largest expense   because global demand for jet fuel and related products is increasing at the same time that jet fuel refining capacity is decreasing in the us particularly in the northeast the refining margin reflected in the prices we pay for jet fuel has increased we purchased an oil refinery as part of our strategy to mitigate the increasing cost of the refining margin we are paying

in june 2012 monroe acquired the trainer refinery and related assets located near philadelphia pennsylvania from phillips 66 which had shut down operations at the refinery monroe invested 180 million  to acquire the refinery monroe received a 30 million  grant from the commonwealth of pennsylvania the acquisition includes pipelines and terminal assets that will allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern us including our new york hubs at laguardia and jfk 

because the products and services of monroes refinery operations are discrete from our airline services segment results are prepared for our airline segment and our refinery segment   financial information on our segment reporting can be found in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

refinery operations and strategic agreements 

the facility is capable of refining 185000 barrels of crude oil per day bp is the primary supplier of crude oil used by the refinery under a three year agreement we are also exploring other sources of crude oil supply such as bringing supply to the refinery by rail from the bakken oil field in north dakota we have increased the refinerys jet fuel capacity through capital improvements the refinerys remaining production consists of gasoline diesel and refined products nonjet fuel products under a multiyear agreement we are exchanging a significant portion of the nonjet fuel products with phillips 66 for jet fuel to be used in our airline operations substantially all of the remaining production of nonjet fuel products is being sold to bp under a longterm buysell agreement effectively exchanging those nonjet fuel products for jet fuel our agreement with phillips 66 requires us to deliver specified quantities of nonjet fuel products and they are required to deliver jet fuel to us if we or phillips 66 do not have the specified quantity and type of product available the delivering party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement substantially all of the refinerys expected production of nonjet fuel products is included in these agreements 

refinery startup 

during the december 2012 quarter fuel production increased at the refinery however superstorm sandy negatively impacted the refinery start up slowing production and lowering efficiency levels the refinery recorded a 63 million  net loss for the quarter 

new york strategy 

strengthening our position in new york city continues to be an important part of our network strategy as discussed below key components of this strategy are operating a domestic hub at laguardia and creating a stateoftheart facility at jfk in may 2012 we announced new and expanded service to 10 popular leisure destinations in addition to the service expansion discussed below in the caribbean bermuda and florida from laguardia and jfk these flights began operating in the december quarter of 2012 

laguardia during december 2011 we closed transactions with us airways where we received takeoff and landing rights each a slot pair at laguardia in exchange for slot pairs at reagan national this exchange allows us to operate a new domestic hub at laguardia we have increased capacity at laguardia by 42 since march 2012 adding 100 new flights and a total of 26 new destinations the first phase of new flights began on march 25 and the second phase commenced on july 11 we currently operate about 260 daily flights between laguardia and 60 cities more than any other airline 

we are also investing more than 160 million in a renovation and expansion project at laguardia to enhance the customer experience in december 2012 we opened the connector linking terminals c and d and in september 2012 we opened a new skyclub in terminal c ongoing investments include expanded security lanes and a baggage handling system in both terminals as well as an expanded skyclub in terminal d 

jfk while our expanded laguardia schedule is focused on providing industryleading domestic service we are optimizing our international and transcontinental flight schedule at jfk to facilitate convenient connections for our passengers and improve coordination with our skyteam alliance partners 

at jfk we currently operate domestic flights primarily at terminal 2 and international flights at terminal 3 and to a lesser extent terminal 4 our fiveyear 12 billion renovation project at jfk which began in 2010 is on schedule the expansion and enhancement of terminal 4 which includes the construction of nine new international gates is expected to be open in the spring of 2013 upon completion of the terminal 4 expansion we will relocate our operations from terminal 3 to terminal 4 proceed with the demolition of terminal 3 and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from terminals 2 and 4 once our project is complete we expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance including reduced taxi times and better ontime performance 

alliances and equity investments 

we have made longterm investments in other airlines that give us the ability to increase our network scale and produce revenue improvements we invested in gol and aeromexico because they operate in latin americas two largest markets brazil and mexico respectively pending regulatory approval we also agreed to buy 49 of virgin atlantic currently held by singapore airlines for 360 million we also entered into a joint venture agreement with virgin atlantic with respect to operations on nonstop routes between the united kingdom and north america we and virgin atlantic will file an application with the us department of transportation for us antitrust immunity with respect to the joint venture 

pilot agreement 

during the june 2012 quarter we reached an agreement with the air line pilots association international “alpa” to modify the existing collective bargaining agreement covering delta’s pilots the agreement which was ratified by the pilots in june 2012 provides career growth opportunities as well as pay and benefits improvements for our pilots including increases to base pay and changes to our profit sharing program the agreement which becomes amendable on december 31 2015 will also provide delta with productivity gains and support our domestic fleet restructuring 

results of operations  2012  compared to 2011   

operating revenue 





passenger revenue passenger revenue increased 16 billion  or 5  due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield of 5  on a 2  decline in capacity passenger mile yield and unit revenue increased due to fare increases higher revenue under corporate travel contracts and improvements in our products and services 

  

international mainline passenger revenue increased 520 million in early 2011 we faced industry overcapacity in the transatlantic market and in connection with our joint venture partners airfranceklm and alitalia we reduced capacity in underperforming markets during the second half of 2011 and in 2012 as a result atlantic prasm was up 9  driven by a 5  increase in yield on a 7  decrease in capacity pacific passenger revenue increased 10  on a 3  and 6  increase in capacity and traffic respectively these results reflect pacific market improvement as demand returned to levels seen prior to the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan latin america passenger revenue increased 8  on a 3  and 6  increase in capacity and traffic respectively 

operating expense 



1    nm  not meaningful 

fuel expense including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements fuel expense increased 468 million  because of a 6  increase in our average price per gallon despite a 2  decrease in consumption the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedge losses of 66 million  during the year ended december 31 2012  



the table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon 



fuel purchase cost  fuel purchase cost is based on the market price for jet fuel at airport locations 

refinery impact  the refinery results include the impact on fuel expense of selfsupply from the production of the refinery and from refined products exchanged with phillips 66 and bp as described in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent that we account for exchanges of refined products as nonmonetary transactions we include the results of those transactions within fuel expense 

fuel hedge losses gains and mtm adjustments  during the year ended december 31 2012  our fuel hedge losses of 66 million  included 27 million  of mtm adjustments these mtm adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods   such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period  the losses for mtm adjustments are reflected in the table above to calculate an effective fuel cost for the period 

we adjust fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost our average price per gallon adjusted a nongaap financial measure as defined in supplemental information below was 326  for the year ended december 31 2012  

salaries and related costs  the increase in salaries and related costs is primarily due to employee pay increases increases in pension expense and other benefits 

during the june 2012 quarter we reached an agreement with alpa that increases pay and benefits for our pilots our pilots and substantially all other employees received base pay increases on july 1 2012 and received additional increases on january 1 2013 these increases are designed both to recognize changes to the profit sharing program described below and to accelerate the planned 2013 pay increase for nonpilot employees 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs consists of costs associated with maintenance of aircraft used in our operations and maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business the increase in maintenance costs is primarily due to the cyclical timing of maintenance events on our fleet additionally maintenance cost increased as we accelerated certain maintenance events into 2012 resulting in a lower total cost for those activities and completed maintenance initiatives to improve our operational reliability 

passenger commissions and other selling expenses the decrease in passenger commissions and other selling expenses is primarily due to lower booking fees and international commission rates partially offset by increases in sales 

contracted services contracted services expense decreased yearoveryear due primarily to the impact of severe winter storms on our operations in the march 2011 quarter 

profit sharing   our broad based employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined by the terms of the program we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees in determining the amount of profit sharing the terms of the program specify the exclusion of special items such as mtm adjustments and restructuring and other items from pretax profit during the june 2012 quarter our profit sharing program was modified so that we will pay 10 of profits on the first 25 billion of annual profits effective with the plan year beginning january 1 2013 compared to paying 15 of annual profits for the 2012 plan year under the program we will continue to pay 20 of annual profits above 25 billion 

restructuring and other items due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items a yearoveryear comparison is not meaningful for a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items see note 16  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

results of operations  2011  compared to 2010   

operating revenue 





mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield from fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices and from higher revenue under corporate travel contracts 

 

 

regional carriers  passenger revenue from regional carriers increased 9  due to an 12  improvement in prasm on a 2  decline in capacity passenger mile yield increased 12  reflecting fare increases we implemented in response to increased fuel prices 

cargo  cargo revenue increased 21  due to a 12 improvement in yield and an 8 increase in volume 

other other revenue increased 210 million due to higher maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business and 65 million due to an increase in the volume of ticket change fees these increases were partially offset by 90 million in lower baggage fee revenue resulting from an increase in bag fees waived for premium customers and customers under our cobrand credit card agreement with american express 

operating expense 



on july 1 2010 we sold compass and mesaba our whollyowned subsidiaries to trans states and pinnacle respectively upon the closing of these transactions we entered into new or amended longterm capacity purchase agreements with compass mesaba and pinnacle prior to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba as our whollyowned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items subsequent to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense 

fuel expense including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements fuel expense increased 29 billion  on flat consumption the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per gallon including the impact of fuel hedge activity 



fuel expense increased primarily due to higher unhedged fuel prices partially offset by an improvement in net fuel hedge results the table below shows the impact of hedging on fuel expense and average price per gallon 



our average price per gallon adjusted for mtm adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period a nongaap financial measure as defined in supplemental information below was 305  for the year ended december 31 2011  during 2011  our net fuel hedge gains of 420 million  included 26 million  of mtm adjustments recorded in periods other than the settlement period 

salaries and related costs salaries and related costs increased due to a 3 average increase in headcount and employee pay increases partially offset by the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense excluding the impact of fuel expense discussed above increased primarily due to the change in reporting for the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to costs associated with increased maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business reflected in other revenue above 

passenger commissions and other selling expenses credit card and sales commissions increased in conjunction with the 11 increase in passenger revenue 

aircraft rent aircraft rent decreased primarily due to the restructuring of certain existing leases and the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

restructuring and other items due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items a yearoveryear comparison is not meaningful for a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items see note 16  to the notes of the consolidated financial statements 

nonoperating results 



during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we recorded 118 million  68 million  and 391 million  in losses from the early extinguishment of debt which primarily related to the writeoff of debt discounts these debt discounts are a result of fair value adjustments recorded in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of our longterm debt due to purchase accounting and a 10 billion advance purchase of skymiles by american express as a result of these writeoffs and scheduled amortization our unamortized debt discount has decreased from 14 billion at the beginning of 2010 to 527 million  at december 31 2012  

income taxes 

we consider all income sources including other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations during the three years ended december 31 2012  we did not record an income tax provision for us federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance the following table shows the components of our income tax provision benefit 



during 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit of 85 million  primarily related to the recognition of alternative minimum tax refunds 

at december 31 2012  we had 163 billion  of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards accordingly we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years our us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2022  

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2012  we had 52 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 34 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 18 billion  in undrawn revolving credit facilities 

sources of liquidity 

operating cash flow 

cash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity we generated positive cash flows from operations of 25 billion  in 2012  and 28 billion in each of 2011  and 2010  see below under timing of skymiles sales for a discussion of the variances in 2012 and 2011 cash flows from operating activities compared to the preceding years we expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2013 

our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors 

seasonality of advance ticket sales  we sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customers travel date and receive cash payment at the time of sale as a result we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability the air traffic liability increases during the spring as we have increased sales in advance of the summer peak travel season our cash balances are typically higher at the beginning of the summer and at a low point during the winter 

fuel and fuel hedge margins  the cost of jet fuel is our most significant expense representing approximately 36 of our total operating expenses the market price for jet fuel is highly volatile and can vary significantly from period to period this price volatility affects our cash flows from operations impacting comparability from period to period 

we have jet fuel inventories at various airport locations which are used in our airline operations also we acquired the trainer oil refinery in 2012 which as part of refinery operations has refined oil product inventories jet fuel and refined oil product inventories are recorded as fuel inventory fuel inventory increased during 2012 as a result of the start up of refinery operations in the september quarter and the transition of our fuel supply program the increase in fuel inventory to achieve normal operating levels at our refinery was offset by a similar increase in accounts payable and therefore did not have a significant impact on operating cash flows during 2012 the remaining 180 million increase in fuel inventory was a result of the transition in deltas fuel supply program 

as part of our fuel hedging program we may be required to pay hedge margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position conversely if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position we may receive hedge margin our future cash flows are impacted depending upon the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying our derivative contracts 

timing of skymiles sales  in december 2011 we amended our american express agreements and agreed to sell 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles to american express in each december from 2011 through 2014 under the december 2011 amendment american express purchased 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles in both 2012 and 2011 in 2011 this operating cash flow was largely offset by working capital changes we anticipate american express will make additional purchases of 675 million  of unrestricted skymiles in both 2013 and 2014 

in 2008 we entered into a multiyear extension of our american express agreements and received 10 billion from american express for an advance purchase of restricted skymiles the 2008 agreement provided that our obligations with respect to the advance purchase would be satisfied as american express uses the purchased miles over a specified future period “skymiles usage period” during the skymiles usage period which commenced in december 2011 american express draws down skymiles valued at 333 million  annually over three years beginning 2012 instead of paying cash to delta for skymiles used this draw down of 333 million  in skymiles reduced cash flows from operations in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 

pension contributions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act as modified by the the pension protection act of 2006 we contributed 697 million  and 598 million to our defined benefit pension plans during 2012 and 2011 respectively we estimate the funding requirements under these plans will total approximately 675 million  in 2013 

undrawn lines of credit 

delta has available 18 billion  in undrawn lines of credit as described in note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have an undrawn 12 billion firstlien revolving credit facility as part of our 2011 credit facilities the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in april 2016 

we also have an undrawn 450 million revolving credit facility included in the 2012 pacific facilities as described in note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the 2012 pacific facilities are secured by our pacific routes and slots as described in note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements this revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate and expires in october 2017 in addition we have an undrawn bank revolving credit facility of 150 million 

the credit facilities mentioned above have covenants such as collateral coverage ratios if we are not in compliance with these covenants we must repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and may not be able to draw on the revolving credit facilities our ability to obtain additional financing if needed on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that a significant portion of our assets are subject to liens 

investing and financing 

capital expenditures   

we incurred capital expenditures of 20 billion in 2012 and 13 billion in each of 2011 and 2010 our capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and are enhancing our product offering 

we have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained longterm financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft we expect that we will invest more than 2 billion in 2013 primarily for aircraft aircraft modifications and the purchase of a 360 million equity investment in virgin atlantic the 2013 investments will be funded through cash from operations and new financings 

financings 

at december 31 2012  total debt and capital leases including current maturities was 127 billion  a 11 billion  reduction from december 31 2011  and a 25 billion reduction from december 31 2010  we have focused on reducing our total debt over the past three years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet in addition we have refinanced previous financing transactions which we expect to reduce our total future interest expense 

in 2012 we received 480 million in proceeds secured by aircraft previously financed by debt in 2012 we also refinanced 17 billion in debt and undrawn revolving credit facilities secured by our pacific routes and slots which resulted in a lower interest rate we expect the pacific routes and slots refinancing transaction will generate more than 30 million in annual interest expense savings 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2012  that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments which are generally ordinary course of business obligations that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 

during 2012 our contractual obligations were impacted by our agreement with bombardier to purchase 40 crj900 aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2014 and with our agreement with pinnacle airlines inc to purchase 16 crj900 aircraft with deliveries in 2013 our estimated payments to purchase these aircraft are included in the obligations below in addition we entered into agreements with southwest airlines and the boeing company to lease 88   b717200 aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2015 



  

 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt the table excludes amounts received from american express for its advance purchase of restricted skymiles because this obligation will be satisfied by american express use of skymiles over a specified period rather than by cash payments from us for additional information about our agreements with american express see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using libor at december 31 2012  

contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying 

employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our employee benefit obligations see “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

aircraft purchase commitments represents primarily our commitments to purchase 100  b737900er aircraft 18  b7878 aircraft 56  crj900 aircraft and four  previously owned md90 aircraft our purchase commitment for 18  b7878 aircraft provides for certain aircraft substitution rights 

other obligations represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other third party services and products additionally other obligations includes estimates of lease payments that will be made under agreements entered into in 2012 with southwest airlines and the boeing company to lease 88   b717200 aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2015 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” offers incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements and airlines that participate in the skymiles program as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we also sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines   

the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below these are 1 passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and 2 the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with two deliverables 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation  we value each deliverable on a standalone basis our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers and is reevaluated at least annually we use established ticket prices to determine the standalone selling price of air transportation we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 

we defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused  a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately 50 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

sale of mileage credits   customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have two deliverables 1 the mileage credits redeemable for future travel and 2 the marketing component 

our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express we defer revenue related to the mileage credits sold to american express based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines and reevaluate our deferral rate at least annually we allocate an amount to the marketing component in an amount equal to the excess of the amount received over the mileage component under this approach the residual method” the deferred revenue from the mileage component is recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided while the portion of the revenue related to the marketing component is recognized as those marketing services are provided we will continue to use the residual method until our contract with american express is materially modified if we materially modify this agreement we will then be required to allocate the consideration received to the marketing and the mileage components based upon their relative selling prices “relative selling price method” a material modification of this contract and the resultant change from the residual method to the relative selling price method could impact our deferral rate or cause an adjustment to our deferred revenue balance which could materially impact our future financial results 

breakage for mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed management uses statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years  at december 31 2012 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 44 billion a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 30 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2012 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 we assess our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets under a qualitative or quantitative approach under a qualitative approach we consider many market factors including those listed under key assumptions below we analyze these market factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment under a quantitative approach we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below if the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value 

when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering market capitalization and other factors when we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinitelived intangible assets fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 a combination of limited market transactions and the lease savings method for certain airport slots which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates 3 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 4 projected discounted future cash flows an income approach 

key assumptions  the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 our projected revenues expenses and cash flows 2 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 3 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 4 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates  in addition we consider the amount the intangible assets fair value exceeded their carrying value in the most recent fair value measurement using a quantitative approach 

changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 an increase in fuel prices 3 declining passenger mile yields 4 lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened us and global economy 5 interruption to our operations due to an employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons and 6 changes to the regulatory environment 

we assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses the combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues expenses and cash flows more than offset the impact of increasing fuel prices and other airline input costs the stabilizing operating environment for us airlines has resulted in annual yields increasing along with load factors leading to improved financial results 

goodwill our goodwill balance was 98 billion  at december 31 2012  we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors including applicable factors noted in  key assumptions  above 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets had a net carrying amount of 47 billion  at december 31 2012  indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam and collaborative arrangements 

in 2012 we determined that there was no indication that our indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired based upon our assessments these assessments included analyses and weighting of all relevant factors including the significant inputs and key assumptions which impact the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 207 billion  at december 31 2012  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we record impairment losses on flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircrafts carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

income tax valuation allowance 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets we establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our future projections of sustained profitability deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results our industrys historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies 

we recorded a full valuation allowance in 2004 due to our cumulative three year loss position at that time compounded by the negative industrywide business trends and outlook at december 31 2012 we had an 110 billion valuation allowance established against our deferred income tax assets which represents a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax asset 

during the march 2012 quarter we moved from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years to a cumulative income position for the first time since we established a full valuation allowance we have concluded as of december 31 2012 that the valuation allowance was still needed on our net deferred tax assets based upon the weight of the factors described above especially considering the history of losses we continue to evaluate our cumulative income position and income trend as well as our future projections of sustained profitability and whether this profitability trend constitutes sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of our valuation allowance in full or in part   

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals  as of december 31 2012  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 133 billion  during 2012  we contributed 697 million  to these plans and recorded 368 million  of expense in salaries and related costs on our consolidated statement of operations in 2013 we estimate we will contribute approximately 675 million  to these plans and that our expense will be approximately 350 million the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 411  and 494  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 495  to 593  between 2010  and 2012  

expected longterm rate of return our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 9 is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets   we review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually   our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation  our actual historical annualized 20year rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans exceeded 9 as of december 31 2012  the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to use a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target  our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2012  was 9 

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen delta elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an   885   interest rate   

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards 

presentation of comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the fasb issued presentation of comprehensive income the standard revises the presentation and prominence of the items reported in other comprehensive income and is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted this standard in 2012 and have presented comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 

supplemental information 

we sometimes use information that is derived from the consolidated financial statements but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” certain of this information are considered to be “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission rules the nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 

the following tables show reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

we exclude the following items from casm to determine casmex

asm  available seat mile a measure of capacity asms equal the total number of seats available for transporting passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the total number of miles flown during that period 

casm  operating cost per available seat mile the amount of operating cost incurred per asm during a reporting period 

casmex  the amount of operating cost incurred per asm during a reporting period excluding aircraft fuel and related taxes ancillary businesses profit sharing restructuring and other items and mtm adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period 

passenger load factor  a measure of utilized available seating capacity calculated by dividing rpms by asms for a reporting period

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk 

is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an 

effort to manage our exposure to these risks we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as 

market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in 

earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices   we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel   this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types   the economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets   the hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  

our fuel hedge portfolio consists of call options put options combinations of two or more call options and put options swap contracts and futures contracts   the products underlying the hedge contracts include heating oil crude oil jet fuel and diesel fuel as these commodities are highly correlated with the price of jet fuel that we consume  our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change if fuel prices change significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin we may adjust our hedge portfolio from time to time in response to margin posting requirements 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  aircraft fuel and related taxes including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements accounted for 123 billion  or 36  of our total operating expense we recognized 66 million  of net fuel hedge losses during the year ended december 31 2012  

the following table shows the projected cash impact to fuel cost assuming 10 and 20 increases or decreases in fuel prices the hedge gain loss reflects the change in the projected cash settlement value of our open fuel hedge contracts at december 31 2012  based on their contract settlement dates assuming the same 10 and 20 changes 



 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2012  we had 59 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 67 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 260 million at december 31 2012  and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 40 million exclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge contracts 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2012  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a 123 million  asset position we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in the price of the japanese yen and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 90 million gain or 110 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2013

international alliances 

we have bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions common use of airport gates and ticket counters ticket office colocation and other marketing agreements these alliances often present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing 

our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under international codesharing arrangements we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carriers aircraft that are marketed under our designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carriers designator code 

we have international codeshare arrangements with aeroméxico air france air nigeria alitalia aeroflot china airlines china eastern china southern csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air olympic air royal air maroc vrg linhas aéreas operating as gol vietnam airlines virgin australia and westjet airlines and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with some of these airlines 

skyteam  in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam global airline alliance the other members or prospective members of skyteam are aeroflot aeroméxico air europa air france alitalia china airlines china eastern china southern csa czech airlines kenya airways klm korean air tarom and vietnam airlines aerolineas argentinas garuda indonesia middle east airlines saudi arabian airlines and xiamen airlines each have announced their formal intent to join skyteam within the next two years  one goal of skyteam is to link the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations 

transatlantic joint venture  in addition to being members in skyteam with air france and klm both of which are subsidiaries of the same holding company and alitalia we have a transatlantic joint venture agreement with these carriers this agreement provides for the sharing of revenues and costs on transatlantic routes as well as coordinated pricing scheduling and product development on included routes pursuant to this joint venture we air franceklm and alitalia operate an extensive transatlantic network primarily on routes between north america and europe and secondarily on routes between north america and africa the middle east and india and routes between europe and central america and several countries in northern south america 

transpacific joint venture with virgin australia airlines  in june 2011 we and virgin australia airlines received approval of antitrust immunity for our transpacific alliance antitrust immunity will allow us to implement a proposed joint venture that will expand the reach of delta and virgin australia between the united states and australia and the south pacific the alliance will create a network able to serve thousands of citypairs in north america and the south pacific alone we serve only sydney in australia and virgin australia flies only to los angeles in the united states the antitrust immunized alliance will allow the airlines to fully cooperate on network planning and distribution to deliver a more attractive and competitive service for customers 

enhanced commercial agreements with latin american carriers in 2011 we entered into separate agreements with grupo aeroméxico sab de cv the parent company of aeroméxico and gol linhas aéreas inteligentes sa the parent company of gol for a strategic equity investment in each company and an exclusive commercial relationship with their carriers we believe this will secure our longterm position in the important and expanding latin markets of mexico and brazil respectively the agreements provide for expansion of codesharing additional alignment of service attributes offered to frequent flyer members of our sky miles program and the other carriers programs and additional cooperation for selling activities the expanded relationship with aeroméxico also contemplates the establishment of a jointventure maintenance repair and overhaul facility in guadalajara mexico 

domestic alliances 

we have entered into a marketing alliance with alaska airlines which includes mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements our alliance agreement with alaska airlines provides for extensive cooperation with respect to our west coast presence 

we also have frequent flyer and reciprocal lounge agreements with hawaiian airlines and codesharing agreements with american eagle airlines “american eagle” and hawaiian airlines these marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers route networks 

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with multiple domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in smalland mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to increase the number of flights we have available in certain locations and to better match capacity with demand approximately 21  of our passenger revenue in 2011 was related to flying by regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program we have contractual arrangements with ten regional carriers to operate regional jet and in certain cases turboprop aircraft using our “dl” designator code in addition to our whollyowned subsidiary comair we have contractual arrangements with expressjet airlines inc formerly atlantic southeast airlines inc and skywest airlines inc both subsidiaries of skywest inc chautauqua airlines inc and shuttle america corporation both subsidiaries of republic airways holdings inc pinnacle airlines inc and mesaba aviation inc mesaba both subsidiaries of pinnacle airlines corp pinnacle compass airlines inc compass and gojet airlines llc both subsidiaries of trans states holdings inc trans states and american eagle 

with the exception of american eagle and a portion of the flights operated for us by skywest airlines as described below these agreements are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers flights operating under our “dl” designator code and we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail and inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

our arrangement with american eagle limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of the flights operated for us by skywest airlines are structured as revenue proration agreements these proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles ®  frequent flyer program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta deltas regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits miles will not expire but are subject to all program rules we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs ® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacitycontrolled seating in 2011  program members redeemed more than 275 billion miles in the skymiles program for 12 million award redemptions during this period 82 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel 

other businesses

delta techops delta global services mlt vacations and delta private jets 

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” staffing services for third parties vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations our mro operation known as delta techops is the largest airline mro in north america in addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of approximately 775  aircraft delta techops serves more than 150 aviation and airline customers from around the world delta techops employs approximately 9600 maintenance professionals and is one of the most experienced mro providers in the world our staffing services business delta global services provides staffing services professional security training services and aviation solutions to approximately 150 customers our vacation wholesale business mlt vacations is one of the largest providers of vacation packages in the united states our private jet operations delta private jets provides aircraft charters aircraft management and programs allowing members to purchase flight time by the hour in 2011 the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 900 million 

distribution and expanded product offerings 

our tickets are sold through various distribution channels including telephone reservations deltacom global distribution systems and online travel agencies an increasing number of our tickets are sold through deltacom which reduces our distribution costs and gives us closer contact with our customers we expect to launch a new deltacom platform in 2012 which we expect will result in additional purchases of tickets through that channel 

we are transforming distribution from a commodity approach to a differentiated and merchandised approach we expect that the merchandising initiatives we are implementing primarily through deltacom will generate additional revenue opportunities for us and will improve the experience of our customers our plan is to provide our customers with opportunities to purchase what they value such as first class upgrades economy comfort seating wifi access and skyclub passes we also expect to benefit from increased traffic on deltacom through a combination of advertising revenue and sales of third party merchandise and services such as car rentals hotels and trip insurance 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs 



 

our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to provide an offset against increases in jet fuel prices this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and fuel commodity types which are used together to create a risk mitigating hedge portfolio 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

competition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs the industry is going through a period of transformation through consolidation both domestically and internationally and changes in international alliances consolidation in the airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years including through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization american airlines has recently filed for bankruptcy protection which may enable it to substantially reduce its costs our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure 

domestic 

our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk and salt lake city either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators 

international 

our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united air lines continental airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties that the us has with the member states of the european union and japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic joint venture with air franceklm and alitalia have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united continental air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united continental and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american and japan air lines 

regulatory matters 

the department of transportation “dot” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time the us government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries which allow unrestricted access between the us and the foreign markets these agreements include separate agreements with the european union and japan 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia john f kennedy international airport “jfk” and newark in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations similarly our operations at tokyos narita and haneda airports londons gatwick and heathrow airports and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport associations worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

emissions  the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date the icao has adopted two additional aircraft engine emissions standards the first of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 and the second of which is applicable to engines certified after december 31 2013 on july 6 2011 the epa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes to adopt these two icao aircraft engine emissions standards but the epa has not yet issued the final regulation 

concern about aviation environmental issues including climate change and greenhouse gases has led to taxes on our operations in the united kingdom and in germany both of which have levied taxes directly on our customers we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the united states and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions this could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations ongoing bilateral discussions between the united states and other nations as well as discussions at the icao assembly and conference of the parties most recently in durbin in december 2011 may lead to international treaties or other actions focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation 

the european union has required its member states to implement regulations including aviation in its emissions trading scheme “ets” under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union are subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 are required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets we expect that this system will impose significant costs on our operations in the european union numerous countries including the us and airline groups continue to oppose the european union ets 

cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the united states in addition other legislative or regulatory action including by the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible in particular the epa has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the us or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the european union where we operate or where we may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry in addition to direct costs such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

we seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain elements of our fleet and with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

other environmental matters  we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and entered into consent decrees or settlements regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites was small or was considered de minimis  when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and aircraft drinking water 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international longrange aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2012   we have also committed aircraft to international shortrange requirements the craf program has only been activated twice since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 78400  fulltime equivalent employees approximately 16   of these employees were represented by unions including the following domestic employee groups    



all of our agreements with workgroups at our airline subsidiary comair are currently amendable comair is in discussions with representatives of the respective unions and we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions   

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our airline subsidiary that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes   

completion of merger integration 

integration of a number of the workgroups following our merger with northwest airlines including pilots aircraft maintenance technicians dispatchers meteorologists simulator technicians and office and clerical staff has been completed completion of the integration of other workgroups including flight attendants airport employees and reservations employees will be completed during 2012 following the final resolution of representation issues during the latter part of 2011 the flight attendants airport employees and reservations employees each rejected representation by unions

 item 1a risk factors   

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results likewise significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been extremely volatile during the last several years in 2011 our average fuel price per gallon was 306  a 31  increase from an average fuel price of 233  in 2010 in 2010 our average fuel price per gallon was 233  an 8  increase from an average fuel price of 215  in 2009 in 2008 our average fuel price per gallon was 316  a 41 increase from an average price of 224 in 2007 which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 36  30  and 29  of our operating expense in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry we often have not been able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future in addition our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us 

our fuel hedging activities are intended to provide an offset against increases in jet fuel prices our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our shortterm liquidity 

we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to provide an offset against increases in jet fuel prices this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types which are used together to create a risk mitigating hedge portfolio   the economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets   the hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  and may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements which are driven by changes in price of the underlying commodity and the contracts used   the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change   if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin  which could have a material adverse impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

our funding obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans we   sponsor is significant and can vary materially because of changes in   investment asset returns and values 

as of december 31 2011  our defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately 193 billion  and were funded through assets with a value of approximately 78 billion  the benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates neither of which is in the control of delta we estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plans which are governed by erisa and have been frozen for future accruals is approximately 700 million  in 2012 estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control including among other things the market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations 

our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities   and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future   needs 

we have substantial indebtedness which could 

 

 

 

 

in addition a substantial level of indebtedness particularly because a significant portion of our assets are currently subject to liens could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business these liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions industry trends performance and many other factors not within our control 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements and indentures   include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our   financial and business operations 

our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time which may be reflected in appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures these changes could result from factors that are not under our control a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 

the credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders or the trustee could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and our cash may become restricted we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our   operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants aircraft maintenance technicians ground support personnel and other personnel as of december 31 2011  approximately 16  of our workforce was unionized relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted our agreement with our pilots becomes amendable in december 2012 all of our agreements with workgroups at our airline subsidiary comair are currently amendable comair is in discussions with representatives of the respective unions and we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions 

if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in amsterdam cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city and tokyonarita each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made and continue to make significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively because of the rapid pace of new developments these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to manage these challenges effectively our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition any internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third party locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business 

our primary credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances the initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards our primary credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash if circumstances were to occur that would allow american express or our visamastercard processor to initiate a holdback the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability in the event that the insurance that we carry to cover damages arising from future accidents is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business 

our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality which can cause our results to fluctuate 

our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in fuel consumption to avoid such weather turbulencerelated injuries delays and cancellations any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional   carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including third party carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers to the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation 

in general under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses “nols” to offset future taxable income in general an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders generally 5 shareholders applying certain lookthrough rules increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period generally three years 

as of december 31 2011  delta reported a consolidated federal pretax nol carryforward of approximately 168 billion  both delta and northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code as a result of the merger northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change delta also experienced a subsequent ownership change on december 17 2008 as a result of the merger the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period 

the delta and northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability to utilize prechange nols that were not subject to limitation and could further limit the ability to utilize nols that were already subject to limitation limitations imposed on the ability to use nols to offset future taxable income could cause us federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such nols to expire unused in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes nols generated subsequent to december 17 2008 are not limited 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk and salt lake city either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators 

discount carriers including southwest airtran now owned by southwest and jetblue have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the united states and on other network carriers in the domestic market in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization american has recently filed for bankruptcy protection which may enable it to substantially reduce its costs our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including skyteam the star alliance among united air lines continental airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties that the us has with the member states of the european union and japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic joint venture with air franceklm and alitalia have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united continental air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united continental and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american and japan air lines 

consolidation in the domestic airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which resulted in industrywide liquidity issues potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security including as a result of our global operations insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faas regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax and has recently proposed additional departure fees a ticket tax increase or additional fees if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast united states have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines in contrast the failure of the federal government to upgrade the us air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets the failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for us air travel increases having a material adverse effect on our operations failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

events related to extreme weather delays caused the dot to promulgate regulations imposing potentially severe financial penalties upon airlines that have flights experiencing extended tarmac delays these regulations could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances 

future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the united states we expect that this system will impose additional costs on our operations in the european union other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion in addition a security breach in which passenger or employee data is exposed could result in disruption to our operations damage to our reputation and significant costs 

our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly 1 reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events and 2 increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general   since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull   the coverage currently extends through   september 30 2012  and we expect the coverage to be further extended   the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially if available such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all resulting in an interruption to our operations

ground facilities 

we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases we own our atlanta reservations center other real property in atlanta and the former northwest headquarters building and flight training buildings which are located near the minneapolisst paul international airport other owned facilities include reservations centers in minot north dakota and chisholm minnesota and a data processing center in eagan minnesota we also own property in tokyo including a 13acre site in downtown tokyo and a 33acre land parcel 512room hotel and flight kitchen located near tokyos narita international airport 

we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve at most airports we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other improvements and facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft these leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30 years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports including among others 1 our main atlanta maintenance base 2 our atlanta air cargo facilities and 3 our hangar and air cargo facilities at the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport salt lake city international airport detroit metropolitan international airport minneapolisst paul international airport and seattletacoma international airport our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities including in some cases amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction we also lease marketing ticketing and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms 

in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

the city of atlanta is currently implementing portions of a 10 year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport the cip includes among other things a 9000 foot fullservice runway that opened in may 2006 related airfield improvements a new international terminal and gate capacity that is scheduled to open in may 2012 new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements the cip will not be complete until at least 2014 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds 

during the december 2010 quarter we began a redevelopment project at jfk where we currently operate primarily at terminal 2 for domestic flights and terminal 3 for international flights under leases with the port authority of new york and new jersey “port authority” we estimate this project will cost approximately 12 billion and will be completed in stages over five years we also conduct some flights from terminal 4 which is operated by jfk international air terminal llc a private party under a lease with the port authority our jfk redevelopment project currently includes the 1 enhancement and expansion of terminal 4 including the construction of nine new gates 2 construction of a passenger connector between terminal 2 and terminal 4 3 demolition of the outdated terminal 3 facilities and 4 development of the terminal 3 site for aircraft parking positions upon completion of the terminal 4 expansion expected to occur in 2013 we will relocate our operations from terminal 3 to terminal 4 proceed with demolition activities in terminal 3 and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from terminals 2 and 4 for information about special project bonds issued to fund a substantial majority of the project and our 30 year sublease of space in terminal 4 from the operator of terminal 4 see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2011 we executed agreements with us airways and the port authority allowing us to expand our flight operations into terminal c at new yorks laguardia airport this project allows us to accommodate additional flights into laguardia as part of the expansion we are also investing 100 million to create an expanded main terminal at laguardia in terminals c and d and will build a bridge to link the two terminals 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

  

in may june and july 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the us district courts for the northern district of georgia the middle district of florida and the district of nevada against delta and airtran airways “airtran” in these cases the plaintiffs originally alleged that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtrans ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag deltas imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtrans imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the first bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the northern district of georgia by the multidistrict litigation “mdl” panel 

in february 2010 the plaintiffs in the mdl proceeding filed a consolidated amended class action complaint which substantially expanded the scope of the original complaint in the consolidated amended complaint plaintiffs add new allegations concerning alleged signaling by both delta and airtran based upon statements made to the investment community by both carriers relating to industry capacity levels during 20082009 plaintiffs also add a new cause of action against delta alleging attempted monopolization in violation of section 2 of the sherman act paralleling a claim previously asserted against airtran but not delta 

in august 2010 the district court issued an order granting deltas motion to dismiss the section 2 claim but denying its motion to dismiss the section 1 claim plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify the section 1 class which remains pending delta believes the claims in these cases are without merit and is vigorously defending these lawsuits 

eu regulation 261 class action litigation 

in february 2011 a putative class action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois seeking to represent all us residents who were passengers on flights during the period from feb 2009 to the present who are allegedly entitled to compensation under eu regulation 261 because their flight was cancelled or delayed by more than 3 hours plaintiffs allege that delta has incorporated a duty to pay this compensation into its contract of carriage and assert a claim for breach of contract as the basis for their cause of action the complaint seeks recovery of the eu regulation 261 compensation of €600 for each us resident on a flight qualifying for such compensation delta disputes the allegations in the complaint has filed a motion to dismiss all claims and intends to vigorously defend the matter 

canadian passenger surcharge antitrust litigation 

  

on july 31 2009 two parallel putative class actions were filed against a number of canadian asian european and us carriers including delta in the ontario superior court of justice both allege that the defendants colluded to fix the price of passenger surcharges in canadaasia and canadaeurope markets respectively there are no allegations in the complaints of any specific act by delta in furtherance of either conspiracy the complaints seek damages in excess of 100 million we believe the allegations against delta are without merit and intend to vigorously defend these cases

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results   of operations 

financial highlights  2011 compared to 2010 

our net income for 2011  was 854 million  or 101  per diluted share this is 261 million higher than 2010  despite significantly higher fuel costs total operating revenue increased 34 billion  on an 11  increase in passenger mile yield primarily due to higher passenger revenues as we were able to adjust ticket prices in response to higher fuel prices total operating expense was up 36 billion  or 12  driven primarily by a 29 billion  increase in fuel expense including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements 

fuel price volatility continues to represent a significant risk to our business and the airline industry as a whole our fuel cost per gallon increased 31  from 2010  to 2011  during 2011  fuel expense including amounts under contract carrier agreements increased by 29 billion  and now represents 36  of total operating expense during 2011  gains from our hedging program reduced fuel expense by 420 million  including fuel hedge activity our average price per fuel gallon in 2011  was 306  as compared to 233  in 2010  

our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile casm for 2011  increased to 1412  cents compared to 1269  cents in 2010  primarily reflecting higher fuel prices for 2011  casmex a nongaap financial measure as defined in supplemental information below was 853  cents or 3 higher than 2010  primarily reflecting higher revenuerelated expenses and salaries and related costs 

during 2011  we reduced our total debt and capital leases by 15 billion  and ended the year with 54 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and availability under credit facilities 

fleet strategy 

during 2011 we entered into an agreement with the boeing company boeing to purchase 100 b737900er aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2018 we have obtained committed longterm financing for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft the boeing agreement and our plans to bring into service 30 to 40 previously owned md90 aircraft over the next two to three years will enable us to replace on a capacityneutral basis older less efficient aircraft scheduled to be retired the majority of the md90 aircraft scheduled to come into service over the next two to three years were purchased or leased in 2010 and 2011 these b737900er and md90 aircraft will have lower unit costs than the aircraft they are replacing as a result of lower maintenance costs and fuel efficiencies 

in addition to lowering unit costs we are also investing in our fleet to enhance the customer experience the stateoftheart b737900er will offer an industry leading customer experience including expanded carryon baggage space and a roomier cabin by the end of 2013 our entire widebody international fleet will be updated with full flatbed seats in businesselite we completed the installation of full flatbed seats in the businesselite cabin of our b777 and b767400er aircraft during 2011 due to the success of our economy comfort product which we began offering during the 2011 summer on longhaul international flights we are expanding economy comfort throughout our mainline and regional fleet by the summer of 2012 we have also been investing in our domestic and regional fleet with inflight wifi on all twoclass domestic aircraft interior upgrades and the installation of additional first class seating 

new york strategy 

strengthening our position in new york city is an important part of our network strategy as discussed below key components of this strategy are operating a domestic hub at new yorks laguardia airport laguardia and creating a stateoftheart facility at new yorks john f kennedy international airport jfk 

laguardia during december 2011 we closed the transactions contemplated under an agreement with us airways including the exchange of takeoff and landing rights each a slot pair at laguardia and reagan national airports which will allow us to operate a new domestic hub at laguardia under the agreement 1 delta acquired 132 slot pairs at laguardia from us airways and 2 us airways acquired from delta 42 slot pairs at reagan national the rights to operate additional daily service to são paulo brazil in 2015 and 665 million in cash additionally delta divested 16 slot pairs at laguardia and eight slot pairs at reagan national to airlines with limited or no service at those airports 

following the closing of the transaction we announced the expansion of our service at laguardia in 2012 to include more than 100 new flights and 29 new destinations our expanded schedule will add nonstop service to top us business markets and additional frequencies to business markets currently served as part of the expansion we are also investing 100 million to create an expanded main terminal at laguardia in terminals c and d and will build a bridge to link the two terminals 

jfk while our expanded laguardia schedule is focused on providing industryleading domestic service our schedule at jfk is being optimized in 2012 for international and transcontinental flights as well as improved coordination with our skyteam alliance partners at jfk we currently operate domestic flights primarily at terminal 2 and international flights at terminal 3 and to a lesser extent terminal 4 our redevelopment project at jfk which began in 2010 currently includes the 1 enhancement and expansion of terminal 4 including the construction of nine new international gates 2 construction of a passenger connector between terminal 2 and terminal 4 3 demolition of the outdated terminal 3 which was constructed in 1960 and 4 development of the terminal 3 site for aircraft parking positions we estimate this project will cost approximately 12 billion and will be completed in stages over five years construction at terminal 4 has commenced and is scheduled to be completed in 2013 upon completion of the terminal 4 expansion we will relocate our operations from terminal 3 to terminal 4 proceed with the demolition of terminal 3 and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from terminals 2 and 4 once our project is complete we expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance including reduced taxi times and better ontime performance 

results of operations  2011  compared to 2010   

operating revenue 





mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield from fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices and from higher revenue under corporate travel contracts 

 

 

regional carriers  passenger revenue from regional carriers increased 9  due to an 12  improvement in prasm on a 2  decline in capacity passenger mile yield increased 12  reflecting fare increases we implemented in response to increased fuel prices 

cargo  cargo revenue increased 21  due to a 12 improvement in yield and an 8 increase in volume 

other other revenue increased 210 million due to higher maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business and 65 million due to an increase in the volume of ticket change fees these increases were partially offset by 90 million in lower baggage fee revenue resulting from an increase in bag fees waived for premium customers and customers under our cobrand credit card agreement with american express 

operating expense 



on july 1 2010 we sold compass and mesaba our whollyowned subsidiaries to trans states and pinnacle respectively upon the closing of these transactions we entered into new or amended longterm capacity purchase agreements with compass mesaba and pinnacle prior to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba as our whollyowned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items subsequent to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense 

fuel expense including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements fuel expense increased 29 billion  on flat consumption the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per fuel gallon including the impact of fuel hedge activity 



fuel expense increased primarily due to higher unhedged fuel prices partially offset by an improvement in net fuel hedge results the table below shows the impact of hedging on fuel expense and average price per fuel gallon 



our average price per fuel gallon adjusted for marktomarket adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period a nongaap financial measure as defined in supplemental information below was 305  for the year ended december 31 2011 during 2011 our net fuel hedge gains of 420 million  included 26 million  in gains for marktomarket adjustments recorded in periods other than the settlement period these marktomarket adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future cash value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period therefore delta adjusts fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost   

salaries and related costs salaries and related costs increased due to a 3 average increase in headcount and employee pay increases partially offset by the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense excluding the impact of fuel expense discussed above increased primarily due to the change in reporting for the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to costs associated with increased maintenance sales to third parties by our mro services business reflected in other revenue above 

passenger commissions and other selling expenses credit card and sales commissions increased in conjunction with the 11  increase in passenger revenue 

aircraft rent aircraft rent decreased primarily due to the restructuring of certain existing leases and the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

restructuring and other items due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items a year over year comparison is not meaningful for a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items see note 15 to the notes of the consolidated financial statements 

results of operations  2010  compared to 2009   

operating revenue 





mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to increased business demand for air travel and an increase in fares largely due to the strengthening of the airline industry revenue environment during 2009 weakened demand for air travel from the global recession and the effects of the h1n1 virus and related capacity reductions had a significant negative impact on our mainline passenger revenue 

 

 

regional carriers  passenger revenue of regional carriers increased 11 from a 13 increase in prasm and a 10 point increase in load factor on a 2 decline in capacity the passenger mile yield increased 12 reflecting an increase in demand for air travel and an increase in fares 

cargo  cargo revenue increased due to a 13 increase in yield and a 25 increase in volume primarily in international markets partially offset by capacity reductions due to the retirement of our dedicated freighter aircraft in 2009 

other  other revenue increased due to higher baggage fee revenue from an increased volume of checked bags 

operating expense 



 

on july 1 2010 we sold compass and mesaba our whollyowned subsidiaries to trans states and pinnacle respectively upon the closing of these transactions we entered into new or amended longterm capacity purchase agreements with compass mesaba and pinnacle prior to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba as our whollyowned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items subsequent to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense 

fuel expense  including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements fuel expense increased 610 million  on flat consumption the table below presents fuel expense gallons consumed and our average price per fuel gallon including the impact of fuel hedge activity 



fuel expense increased primarily due to higher unhedged fuel prices partially offset by an improvement in net fuel hedge results fuel hedge losses in 2009 were primarily due to hedge contracts purchased in 2008 when fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise but instead declined the table below shows the impact of hedging on fuel expense and average price per fuel gallon 



contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense excluding the impact of fuel expense discussed above increased primarily due to the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to returning aircraft to service after temporary storage as well as the timing of engine and airframe maintenance volumes 

passenger commissions and other selling expenses passenger commissions and other selling expenses increased primarily due to higher revenuerelated expenses such as booking fees and sales commissions from the increase in revenue 

profit sharing we recorded 313 million related to our broadbased employee profit sharing plans for 2010 we did not record any profit sharing expense in 2009 our broadbased profit sharing plans provide that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined in the plan document we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees 

restructuring and other items due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items a year over year comparison is not meaningful for a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items see note 15 to the notes of the consolidated financial statements 

nonoperating results 



during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded 68 million  391 million  and 83 million  in losses from the early extinguishment of debt which primarily related to the writeoff of debt discounts these debt discounts are a result of fair value adjustments recorded in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of our longterm debt due to purchase accounting and a 10 billion advance purchase of skymiles by american express as a result of these writeoffs and scheduled amortization our unamortized debt discount has decreased from 19 billion at the beginning of 2009 to 737 million  at december 31 2011  and our amortization of debt discount net has decreased significantly from 2009 to 2011 

the table below shows the changes in miscellaneous net 

income taxes 

we consider all income sources including other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations during the years ended december 31 2011  2010 and 2009  we did not record an income tax provision for us federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance the following table shows the components of our income tax benefit provision 



during 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit of 85 million  primarily related to the recognition of alternative minimum tax refunds 

during 2009 we recorded an income tax benefit of 344 million  including a noncash income tax benefit of 321 million  on the loss from continuing operations with an offsetting noncash income tax expense of 321 million on other comprehensive income this deferred income tax expense of 321 million will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss until all amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss that relate to fuel derivatives which are designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations all amounts relating to our fuel derivative contracts that were previously designated as accounting hedges will be recognized by june 2012 original settlement date of those contracts as a result a noncash income tax expense of 321 million will be recognized in the june 2012 quarter unless we enter into and designate additional fuel derivative contracts as accounting hedges prior to june 2012 

at december 31 2011  we had 168 billion  of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards accordingly we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years our us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2022  

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2011  we had 54 billion  in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 36 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 18 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities 

debt and capital leases at december 31 2011  total debt and capital leases including current maturities was 138 billion  a 15 billion  reduction from december 31 2010  and a 34 billion reduction from december 31 2009 our ability to obtain additional financing if needed on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that a significant portion of our assets are subject to liens 

pension obligations we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are generally governed by the employee retirement income security act we contributed 598 million  and 728 million  to our defined benefit pension plans during 2011 and 2010 respectively we estimate the funding requirements under these plans will total approximately 700 million  in 2012 

advance purchase of skymiles in 2008 we entered into a multiyear extension of our american express agreements and received 10 billion from american express for an advance purchase of skymiles the prepayment the 2008 agreement provided that our obligations with respect to the advance purchase would be satisfied as american express uses the purchased miles over a specified future period “skymiles usage period” rather than by cash payments from us to american express due to the skymiles usage period and other restrictions placed upon american express regarding the timing and use of the skymiles we classified the 10 billion we received the prepayment as longterm debt 

during the skymiles usage period which commenced during the december 2011 quarter american express will draw down on their prepayment instead of paying cash to delta for skymiles used as of december 31 2011 952 million  of the original 10 billion debt or prepayment remained including 333 million which is classified in current maturities of longterm debt and capital leases 

annual sale of skymiles  in december 2011 we amended our american express agreements and sold american express 675 million  of skymiles under the december 2011 amendment we anticipate american express will make additional purchases of 675 million  of skymiles in each of 2012 2013 and 2014 

fuel card obligation  in december 2011 we also obtained a purchasing card with american express for the purpose of buying jet fuel the card currently carries a maximum credit limit of 612 million  and must be paid monthly as of december 31 2011 we had 318 million  outstanding on this purchasing card which was classified as other accrued liabilities

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 

during 2011 our contractual obligations were impacted by our agreement with boeing to purchase 100  b737900er aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2018 our estimated payments to purchase these aircraft are included in aircraft purchase obligations below 



  

 36 

longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt the table excludes amounts received from american express for its advance purchase of skymiles because this obligation will be satisfied by american express use of skymiles over a specified period rather than by cash payments from us for additional information about our agreements with american express see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using libor at december 31 2011

other obligations represents primarily estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other third party services and products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” offers incentives to travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements and airlines that participate in the skymiles program as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we also sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines   

the skymiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables as discussed below these are 1 passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and 2 the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our skymiles program provide customers with two deliverables 1 mileage credits earned and 2 air transportation  effective january 1 2011 we began applying the provisions of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables asu 200913 to passenger tickets earning mileage credits under asu 200913 we value each deliverable on a standalone basis our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers and is reevaluated at least annually we use established ticket prices to determine the standalone selling price of air transportation we allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 

we defer revenue from the mileage credit component of passenger ticket sales and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided we record the portion of the passenger ticket sales for air transportation in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused   the adoption of asu 200913 did not have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition or its classification with regard to passenger tickets earning mileage credits  a hypothetical 10 increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately 50 million as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales 

prior to the adoption of asu 200913 we used the residual method for revenue recognition under the residual method we determined the fair value of the mileage credit component based on prices at which we sold mileage credits to other airlines and then considered the remainder of the amount collected to be the air transportation deliverable 

sale of mileage credits   customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have two deliverables 1 the mileage credits redeemable for future travel and 2 the marketing component 

asu 200913 does not apply to contracts to sell mileage credits entered into prior to january 1 2011 unless those contracts are materially modified as of december 31 2011 we had not materially modified any of our significant agreements our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our cobrand credit card relationship with american express for additional information about this relationship see note 6 for contracts entered into prior to january 1 2011 that have not been materially modified since january 1 2011 we continue to use the residual method for revenue recognition and value only the mileage credits under the residual method the portion of the revenue from the mileage component is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided the portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold the marketing component is recognized in income as other revenue when the related marketing services are provided the fair value of a mileage credit is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines and is reevaluated at least annually   

if we enter into new contracts or materially modify existing contracts to sell mileage credits related to our skymiles program we will value the standalone selling price of the marketing component and allocate the revenue from the contract based on the relative selling price of the mileage credits and the marketing component a material modification of an existing contract could impact our deferral rate or cause an adjustment to our deferred revenue balance which could materially impact our future financial results 

breakage for mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the estimate of breakage is based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years  at december 31 2011  the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 45 billion  a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 31 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2011  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis in september 2011 the fasb issued testing goodwill for impairment the standard revises the way in which entities test goodwill for impairment we adopted this standard and applied its provisions to our annual goodwill impairment test in the december 2011 quarter 

key assumptions  the key assumptions in our impairment tests include 1 our projected revenues expenses and cash flows 2 an estimated weighted average cost of capital 3 assumed discount rates depending on the asset and 4 a tax rate these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates 

changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in impairment factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 an increase in fuel prices 3 declining passenger mile yields 4 lower passenger demand as a result of the weakened us and global economy 5 interruption to our operations due to an employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 6 changes to the regulatory environment and 7 consolidation of competitors in the airline industry 

goodwill as of december 31 2011  and 2010  our goodwill balance was 98 billion  in evaluating goodwill for impairment we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering market capitalization and other factors if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value no further testing is required if however the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value we then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 

identifiable intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets had a net carrying amount of 48 billion  at december 31 2011  indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and assets related to skyteam definitelived intangible assets consist primarily of marketing agreements and contracts and are amortized on a straightline basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts 

we perform the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the assets fair value to its carrying value fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the lease savings method for certain airport slots which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates 3 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 4 projected discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment charge if the assets carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 202 billion  at december 31 2011  this value is based on various factors including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values we record impairment losses on flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 significant changes in projected cash flows 4 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 5 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircrafts carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available 

income tax valuation allowance 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results our industrys historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies we cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets accordingly we have recorded a full valuation allowance totaling 107 billion  against our net deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets we will reverse our valuation allowance in full or in part resulting in a significant income tax benefit in the period such a determination is made 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals  as of december 31 2011  the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 115 billion  during 2011  we contributed 598 million  to these plans and recorded 300 million  of expense in salaries and related costs on our consolidated statement of operations in 2012  we estimate we will contribute approximately 700 million  to these plans and that our expense will be approximately 370 million the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

weighted average discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 494  and 569  at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 570  to 649  between 2009  and 2011  due to remeasurements throughout the year 

expected longterm rate of return the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data   modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets   we review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually   our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation  our actual historical annualized three and five year rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans was approximately 11 and 2 respectively as of december 31 2011  our annualized five year return includes a 26 return during 2008 the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target  our expected longterm rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2011 was 9 

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 



funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen delta elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an   885   interest rate   

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants for additional information see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards 

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 200913 the standard 1 revises guidance on when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting 2 establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 3 eliminates the residual method for revenue recognition and 4 provides guidance on allocating consideration among separate deliverables it applies only to contracts entered into or materially modified after december 31 2010 we adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning january 1 2011  we determined that the only revenue arrangements impacted by the adoption of this standard are those associated with our skymiles program 

fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in may 2011 the fasb issued amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss the standard revises guidance for fair value measurement and expands the disclosure requirements it is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

supplemental information 

we sometimes use information that is derived from the consolidated financial statements but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” certain of this information are considered to be “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission rules the nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 

the following tables show reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

we exclude the following items from casm to determine casmex 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reconciles average price per fuel gallon to average price per fuel gallon adjusted for mtm adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period these marktomarket adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future cash value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period therefore delta adjusts fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders equity 

the following sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices   we actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to provide an offset against increases in jet fuel prices this fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types which are used together to create a risk mitigating hedge portfolio   the economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets   the hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates  

our fuel hedge portfolio generally consists of call options put options combinations of two or more call options and put options swap contracts and futures contracts the products underlying the hedge contracts are derivatives of jet fuel such as heating oil crude oil and low sulfur diesel   our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements which are driven by changes in price of the underlying commodity and the contracts used   the margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change   if fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of margin  we may adjust our hedge portfolio from time to time in response to margin posting requirements 

for the year ended december 31 2011  aircraft fuel and related taxes including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements accounted for 118 billion  or 36  of our total operating expense including 420 million  of net fuel hedge gains 

the following table shows the projected cash impact to fuel cost on both an unhedged and hedged basis assuming 10 and 20 increases or decreases in fuel prices the hedge gain loss reflects the change in the projected cash settlement value of our open fuel hedge contracts at december 31 2011 based on their contract settlement dates assuming the same 10 and 20 changes 



 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates 

at december 31 2011  we had 77 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 61 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 300 million at december 31 2011  and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 40 million inclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge contracts 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts at december 31 2011  we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling an 89 million liability position we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in the price of the japanese yen and canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a 90 million gain or 110 million loss respectively for the year ending december 31 2012

international alliances 

we have bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions common use of airport gates and ticket counters ticket office colocation and other marketing agreements these alliances often present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing 

our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under international codesharing arrangements we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s designator code 

we have international codeshare arrangements with aeromexico air france air nigeria alitalia avianca china airlines china southern csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air olympic air royal air maroc vrg linhas aéreas gol vietnam airlines and virgin blue airlines and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with some of these airlines 

  skyteam  in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam global airline alliance the other members of skyteam are aeroflot aeromexico air europa air france alitalia china southern csa czech airlines kenya airways klm korean air tarom and vietnam airlines aerolineas argentinas china eastern garuda indonesia and saudi arabian airlines have announced their formal intent to join skyteam within the next 2 years  one goal of skyteam is to link the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations 

  transatlantic joint venture  in addition to being members in skyteam with air france and klm both of which are subsidiaries of the same holding company and alitalia we have a transatlantic joint venture agreement with these carriers this agreement provides for the sharing of revenues and costs on transatlantic routes as well as coordinated pricing scheduling and product development on included routes pursuant to this joint venture we air franceklm and alitalia operate an extensive transatlantic network primarily on routes between north america and europe and secondarily on routes between north america and africa the middle east and india and routes between europe and central america and several countries in northern south america 

  proposed joint venture with virgin blue airlines group  in july 2009 we and virgin blue international airlines vaustralia virgin blue airlines pacific blue airlines australia and pacific blue airlines new zealand filed an application with the us department of transportation “dot” for antitrust immunity for a proposed joint venture that will expand the reach of delta and the virgin blue carriers between the united states and australia and the south pacific in september 2010 the dot tentatively denied this application we and the virgin blue carriers subsequently submitted additional information about our proposed joint venture to the dot and will submit further information in early 2011 we expect the dot to make a final ruling on this application in 2011 

domestic alliances 

we have entered into a marketing alliance with alaska airlines which includes mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements our alliance agreement with alaska airlines provides for extensive cooperation with respect to our west coast presence 

we also have frequent flyer and reciprocal lounge agreements with hawaiian airlines and codesharing agreements with american eagle airlines “american eagle” and hawaiian airlines these marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks 

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with multiple domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in smalland mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to increase the number of flights we have available in certain locations and to better match capacity with demand approximately 21 of our passenger revenue in 2010 was related to flying by regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program we have contractual arrangements with nine regional carriers to operate regional jet and in certain cases turboprop aircraft using our “dl” designator code in addition to our whollyowned subsidiary comair we have contractual arrangements with atlantic southeast airlines inc and skywest airlines inc both subsidiaries of skywest inc chautauqua airlines inc and shuttle america corporation both subsidiaries of republic airways holdings inc compass airlines inc pinnacle airlines inc and mesaba aviation inc both subsidiaries of pinnacle airlines corp and american eagle 

with the exception of american eagle and a portion of the flights operated for us by skywest airlines as described below these agreements are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers’ flights operating under our “dl” designator code and we are entitled to all ticket cargo mail and inflight and ancillary revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

our arrangements with american eagle limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of the flights operated for us by skywest airlines are structured as revenue proration agreements these proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles ® frequent flyer program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta’s regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits miles will not expire but are subject to all program rules we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs ® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacitycontrolled seating in 2010 program members redeemed more than 264 billion miles in the skymiles program for more than 12 million award redemptions during this period 83 of revenue miles flown on delta were from award travel

we have several other businesses arising from our airline operations including aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” staffing services for third parties vacation wholesale operations and our private jet operations our mro operations known as delta techops is the largest airline mro in north america in addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of approximately 750 aircraft delta techops serves more than 150 aviation and airline customers from around the world delta techops employs approximately 8500 maintenance professionals and is one of the most experienced mro providers in the world our staffing services business delta global services provides staffing services professional security training services and aviation solutions to approximately 150 customers our vacation wholesale business mlt vacations is one of the largest providers of vacation packages in the united states our private jet operations delta private jets provides aircraft charters aircraft management and programs allowing members to purchase flight time by the hour in 2010 the total revenue from these businesses was approximately 700 million 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2008 through 2010 

 

 

 our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

we use derivative instruments which generally consist of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

competition 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk and salt lake city either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international routes are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united air lines continental airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties with the member states of the european union and japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic joint venture with air franceklm and alitalia have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united continental air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united continental and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american and japan air lines 

consolidation in the airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers and engages in regulation of economic matters such as slot transactions the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs with minimal governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement in the case of the us and the european union with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authorities may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc and laguardia john f kennedy international airport “jfk” and newark in the new york city area our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities similarly our operations at tokyo’s narita airport london’s gatwick and heathrow airports and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport association’s worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we are beginning operations at tokyo’s haneda airport which is also regulated in february 2011 we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

  noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

  emissions  the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with the existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date icao has adopted additional aircraft engine emissions standards applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 but the epa has not yet proposed a rule that incorporates these new icao standards 

concern about aviation environmental issues including climate change and greenhouse gases has led to taxes on our operations in the united kingdom and in germany both of which have levied taxes directly on our customers we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the united states and abroad and become subject to further taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions this could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations ongoing bilateral discussions between the united states and other nations as well as discussions at the icao assembly and conference of the parties most recently in cancun in december 2010 may lead to international treaties or other actions focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation 

the european union has required its member states to implement regulations including aviation in its emissions trading scheme “ets” under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union will be subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 may be required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ets we expect that such a system would impose significant costs on our operations in the european union the air transport association and several us carriers have filed an action in the united kingdom challenging the legality of the ets on various grounds this case has been referred to the european court of justice for adjudication airlines will however be required to comply with the ets unless interim relief is granted 

cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the united states in addition other legislative or regulatory action including by the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible in particular the epa has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the us or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the european union where we operate or where we may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments in addition to direct costs such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain elements of our fleet and with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

  other environmental matters  we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and drinking water 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international longrange aircraft during the contract period ending september 30 2011 

as of january 1 2011 the following numbers of our international longrange aircraft were available for craf activation 

 

we have also committed 75 aircraft to international shortrange requirements the craf program has only been activated twice both times at the stage i level since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class under new voting rules implemented by the nmb on july 1 2010 a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50 of votes cast are for that union a certified labor union would commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 80000 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 17 of these employees were represented by unions including the following domestic employee groups 

 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our airline subsidiary that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes 

completion of merger integration 

integration of a number of the workgroups following our merger with nwa including pilots aircraft maintenance technicians dispatchers meteorologists simulator technicians and office and clerical staff has been completed as discussed below completion of the integration of certain workgroups including flight attendants airport employees and reservations employees will require the final resolution of representation issues we cannot predict when these representation issues will be finally resolved 

under procedures that have been utilized by the nmb each labor union that represented usbased employees at premerger delta or nwa as well as other groups of employees with a sufficient showing of interest may invoke the nmb’s jurisdiction to address representation issues arising from the merger once its jurisdiction is invoked the nmb’s rules call for it to first determine whether the airlines have combined or will combine to form a single carrier on january 7 2009 the nmb first ruled that delta and nwa constitute a single transportation system for representation purposes under the railway labor act in response to applications filed by certain of the premerger unions at delta and nwa the nmb subsequently made the same determination as the unions filed applications to resolve postmerger representation issues in the remaining workgroups 

the nmb has utilized certain procedures to address and resolve representation issues arising from airline mergers which generally have included the following 

 

based upon these procedures representation and related issues have been resolved in usbased workgroups represented by six of the eight labor unions at delta and nwa premerger as noted in 2010 the nmb changed the voting rules for representation elections in the airline industry to provide that a majority of votes cast rather than a majority of votes eligible to be cast is necessary to certify a union to represent a craft or class of employees following the change in voting rules the nmb authorized and conducted elections sought by the two remaining premerger nwa unions the association of flight attendantscwa “afa” which represented flight attendants at premerger nwa and the international association of machinists “iam” which represented various categories of ground employees at premerger nwa the employee groups the union seeking representation and the approximate number of employees in each workgroup prior to the election is set forth in the table below 

 

 10 

in each case the employee groups rejected representation by the unions and the unions have filed claims with the nmb alleging that delta interfered with the elections while we are vigorously challenging the interference claims we cannot predict when or how these matters will be resolved for these workgroups however based on the election results the nmb terminated the premerger certifications of the unions to represent employees in those groups as a result matters that were tied to union representation such as mandatory union dues check off shop steward and similar positions and union committees and offices have also terminated 

if a labor union is certified to represent a combined group postmerger the terms and conditions of employment of the combined work group ultimately will be subject to negotiations toward a joint collective bargaining agreement completing joint collective bargaining agreements covering combined work groups that choose to be represented by a labor union could take significant time which could delay or impede our ability to achieve targeted synergies from the merger 

with respect to integration of seniority lists where the two employee groups in a craft or class have different representation status federal law requires that seniority integration be governed by the procedures first issued by the civil aeronautics board in the alleghenymohawk merger—known as the alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions in general alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions require that seniority be integrated in a “fair and equitable” manner and that any disputes not resolved by negotiations may be submitted to binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator this requirement is consistent with the seniority protection policy that has been adopted by the delta board of directors where both groups are represented by the same union prior to the merger seniority integration is governed by the union’s bylaws and policies the integration of the seniority lists of the pilots of delta and nwa as well as flight dispatchers meteorologists and aircraft maintenance technicians and related technical operations employees has been resolved

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results likewise significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and spiked at record high levels in 2008 before falling dramatically during the latter part of 2008 in 2010 our average fuel price per gallon was 233 an 8 increase from an average fuel price of 215 in 2009 in 2008 our average fuel price per gallon was 316 a 41 increase from an average price of 224 in 2007 which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 30 29 and 38 of our operating expense in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively total operating expense for 2008 reflects a 73 billion noncash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and 11 billion in primarily noncash mergerrelated charges including these charges fuel costs accounted for 28 of total operating expense in 2008 volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry we often have not been able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future 

in addition our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices we use derivative instruments which generally consist of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure depending on the type of hedging instrument used our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be limited 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us 

our funding obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans we sponsor is significant and can vary materially because of changes in investment asset returns and values 

the recent financial crisis and economic downturn resulted in broadly lower investment asset returns and values including in the defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor for eligible employees and retirees as of december 31 2010 the defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately 175 billion and were funded through assets with a value of approximately 82 billion the benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates neither of which is in the control of delta we estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plans which are governed by erisa and have been frozen for future accruals is approximately 600 million in 2011 the significant level of required funding is due primarily to the decline in the investment markets in 2008 which negatively affected the value of our pension assets estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control including among other things the market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations 

our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our shortterm liquidity 

under hedge contracts that we may enter into from time to time counterparties to those contracts can require us to fund the margin associated with any loss position on the contracts if fuel prices fall significantly below the levels at the time we enter into fuel hedging contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of collateral which could have an impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 

we have substantial indebtedness which could 

 

 

in addition a substantial level of indebtedness particularly because substantially all of our assets are currently subject to liens could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business these liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions industry trends performance and many other factors not within our control 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements and indentures include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum unrestricted cash reserves andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time including due to factors that are not under our control resulting in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 

the credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders or the trustee could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and our cash may become restricted we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants and other personnel as of december 31 2010 approximately 17 of our workforce was unionized strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted 

in addition if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

completion of the integration of the delta and northwest airlines workforces may present challenges 

the successful integration of the premerger nwa operations into delta and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combination depend on integrating the premerger delta and nwa employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations while integration of a number of the workgroups including pilots aircraft maintenance technicians dispatchers meteorologists simulator technicians and office and clerical staff has been completed completion of the integration of certain workgroups including flight attendants airport employees and reservations employees of the two premerger airlines will require the final resolution of union representation issues we cannot predict when or how these remaining representation issues will be resolved unexpected delay expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces could affect our financial performance 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in amsterdam cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk parischarles de gaulle salt lake city and tokyonarita each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively because of the rapid pace of new developments these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to manage these challenges effectively our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition any internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third party locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs our technology systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business 

if we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances the initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards our credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash if circumstances were to occur that would allow american express or our visamastercard processor to initiate a holdback the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability the insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate in the event that the insurance is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business 

our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality which can cause our results to fluctuate 

our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather natural disasters and seasonality severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems these events decrease revenue and can also increase costs in addition increases in frequency severity or duration of thunderstorms hurricanes typhoons or other severe weather events including from changes in the global climate could result in increases in fuel consumption to avoid such weather turbulencerelated injuries delays and cancellations any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs in addition demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year because of fluctuations in our results from weather natural disasters and seasonality operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 

an extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business including third party carriers in the delta connection program while we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers to the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation 

in general under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses “nols” to offset future taxable income in general an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders generally 5 shareholders applying certain lookthrough rules increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period generally three years 

as of december 31 2010 delta reported a consolidated federal and state pretax nol carryforward of approximately 175 billion both delta and northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code as a result of the merger northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change delta also experienced a subsequent ownership change on december 17 2008 as a result of the merger the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period 

the delta and northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability to utilize prechange nols that were not subject to limitation and could further limit the ability to utilize nols that were already subject to limitation limitations imposed on the ability to use nols to offset future taxable income could cause us federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such nols to expire unused in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes nols generated subsequent to december 17 2008 are not limited 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk and salt lake city either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators 

discount carriers including southwest airtran and jetblue have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the united states and on other network carriers in the domestic market in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our international routes are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in particular alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united air lines continental airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaties with the member states of the european union and japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

several joint ventures among us and foreign carriers including our transatlantic joint venture with air franceklm and alitalia have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among united continental air canada and lufthansa a transpacific joint venture among united continental and all nippon airways a transatlantic joint venture among american british airways and iberia and a transpacific joint venture between american and japan air lines 

consolidation in the domestic airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and altered cost structures 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which resulted in industrywide liquidity issues potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security including as a result of our global operations insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues the industry is heavily taxed for example the aviation and transportation security act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax a ticket tax increase if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast united states have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines furthermore events related to extreme weather delays have caused congress and the dot to consider proposals related to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays the recent enactment of such a regulation by the dot could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances 

future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the united states we expect that such a system will impose significant costs on our operations in the european union other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly 1 reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events and 2 increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the coverage currently extends through september 30 2011 and we expect the coverage to be further extended the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially if available such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all resulting in an interruption to our operations

aircraft purchase commitments 

our aircraft purchase commitments at december 31 2010 relate to 18 b7878 aircraft and 12 previously owned md90 aircraft during 2010 we entered into an agreement with the boeing company to reaffirm our previous orders for 18 b7878 aircraft and to defer delivery of those aircraft from 20082010 to 20202022 our aircraft purchase commitments do not include orders for five a319100 aircraft and two a320200 aircraft because we have the right to cancel these orders 

aircraft on option 

our options to purchase additional aircraft at december 31 2010 are shown in the following table 

 

 

 

ground facilities 

we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases we own our atlanta reservations center other real property in atlanta and the former northwest headquarters building and flight training buildings which are located near the minneapolisst paul international airport other owned facilities include reservations centers in minot north dakota and chisholm minnesota and a data processing center in eagan minnesota we also own property in tokyo including a 13acre site in downtown tokyo and a 33acre land parcel 512room hotel and flight kitchen located near tokyo’s narita international airport 

we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve at most airports we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other improvements and facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft these leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30 years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement examples of major leases and use agreements at hub or other significant airports that will expire in the next few years include among others 1 our salt lake city international airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2013 and 2 our memphis international airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2011 we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports including among others 1 our main atlanta maintenance base 2 our atlanta air cargo facilities and our hangar and air cargo facilities at the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport salt lake city international airport detroit metropolitan international airport minneapolisst paul international airport and seattletacoma international airport our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities including in some cases amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction we also lease marketing ticketing and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms 

in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

the city of atlanta is currently implementing portions of a 10 year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport the cip includes among other things a 9000 foot fullservice runway that opened in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements the cip will not be complete until at least 2012 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds 

during the december 2010 quarter we began a redevelopment project at jfk where we currently operate primarily at terminal 2 for domestic flights and terminal 3 for international flights under leases with the port authority of new york and new jersey “port authority” we estimate this project will cost approximately 12 billion and will be completed in stages over five years we also conduct some flights from terminal 4 which is operated by jfk international air terminal llc a private party under a lease with the port authority our jfk redevelopment project includes the 1 enhancement and expansion of terminal 4 including the construction of nine new gates 2 construction of a passenger connector between terminal 2 and terminal 4 3 demolition of the outdated terminal 3 facilities and 4 development of the terminal 3 site for aircraft parking positions upon completion of the terminal 4 expansion expected to occur in 2013 we will relocate our operations from terminal 3 to terminal 4 proceed with demolition activities in terminal 3 and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from terminals 2 and 4 for information about special project bonds issued to fund a substantial majority of the project and our 30 year sublease of space in terminal 4 from the operator of terminal 4 see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

in may june and july 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the us district courts for the northern district of georgia the middle district of florida and the district of nevada against delta and airtran airways “airtran” the plaintiffs originally alleged that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtran’s ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag delta’s imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtran’s imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the first bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the northern district of georgia by the multidistrict litigation “mdl” panel 

in february 2010 the plaintiffs in the mdl proceeding filed a consolidated amended class action complaint which substantially expanded the scope of the original complaint in the consolidated amended complaint plaintiffs added new allegations concerning alleged signaling by both delta and airtran based upon statements made to the investment community by both carriers relating to industry capacity levels during 20082009 plaintiffs also added a new cause of action against delta alleging attempted monopolization in violation of section 2 of the sherman act paralleling a claim previously asserted against airtran but not delta 

in august 2010 the district court issued an order granting delta’s motion to dismiss the section 2 claim but denying its motion to dismiss the section 1 claim plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify the section 1 class which delta has opposed this motion remains pending we believe the claims in these cases are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

canadian passenger surcharge antitrust litigation 

on july 31 2009 two parallel putative class actions were filed against a number of canadian asian european and us carriers including delta in the ontario superior court of justice both allege that the defendants colluded to fix the price of passenger surcharges in canadaasia and canadaeurope markets respectively there are no allegations in the complaints of any specific act by delta in furtherance of either conspiracy the complaints seek damages in excess of 100 million we believe the allegations against delta are without merit and intend to vigorously defend these cases

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general information 

we provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states “us” and around the world on october 29 2008 the “closing date” a whollyowned subsidiary of ours merged the “merger” with and into northwest airlines corporation on the closing date northwest airlines corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries including northwest airlines inc collectively “northwest” became whollyowned subsidiaries of delta on december 31 2009 northwest airlines inc merged with and into delta as a result of this merger northwest airlines inc ceased to exist as a separate entity 

results of operations — 2010 compared to 2009 

we reported net income of 593 million for 2010 compared to a net loss of 12 billion for 2009 this 18 billion improvement primarily reflects a strengthening of the airline industry revenue environment in 2010 we recorded special items totaling 851 million in expenses including 450 million of restructuring and mergerrelated items and 401 million primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009 our special items totaled 169 million in net expenses operating margin excluding special items a nongaap financial measure as defined in “supplemental information” below was 84 in 2010 compared to 03 in 2009 

operating revenue 

 

 

  mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to increased business demand for air travel and an increase in fares largely due to the strengthening of the airline industry revenue environment during 2009 weakened demand for air travel from the global recession and the effects of the h1n1 virus and related capacity reductions had a significant negative impact on our mainline passenger revenue 

 

 

  regional carriers  passenger revenue of regional carriers increased 11 from a 13 increase in prasm and a 10 point increase in load factor on a 2 decline in capacity the passenger mile yield increased 12 reflecting an increase in demand for air travel and an increase in fares 

  cargo  cargo revenue increased due to a 13 increase in yield and a 25 increase in volume primarily in international markets partially offset by capacity reductions due to the retirement of our dedicated freighter aircraft in 2009 

  other  other revenue increased due to higher baggage fee revenue from an increased volume of checked bags 

operating expense 

 

 

 on july 1 2010 we sold compass airlines inc “compass” and mesaba aviation inc “mesaba” to trans states airlines inc “trans states” and pinnacle airlines corp “pinnacle” respectively upon the closing of these transactions we entered into new or amended longterm capacity purchase agreements with compass mesaba and pinnacle prior to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba as our whollyowned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items subsequent to these sales expenses related to compass and mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense 

  aircraft fuel and related taxes  aircraft fuel and related taxes increased due to higher average unhedged fuel prices which increased fuel costs 16 billion partially offset by reductions of 13 billion in fuel hedge costs and 156 million from the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving compass and mesaba we recorded 89 million in net fuel hedge costs for 2010 compared to 14 billion in 2009 the fuel hedge costs for 2009 were primarily from losses on hedge contracts purchased in 2008 when fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise but instead declined 

  contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense increased primarily due to higher average fuel prices and the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving compass and mesaba 

  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to returning aircraft to service after temporary storage as well as the timing of engine and airframe maintenance volumes 

  passenger commissions and other selling expenses passenger commissions and other selling expenses increased primarily due to higher revenuerelated expenses such as booking fees and sales commissions from the increase in revenue 

  profit sharing we recorded 313 million related to our broadbased employee profit sharing plans for 2010 we did not record any profit sharing expense in 2009 our broadbased profit sharing plans provide that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined in the plan document we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees 

  restructuring and mergerrelated items restructuring and mergerrelated items increased primarily due to the following 

 

other expense income 

other expense net for 2010 was 16 billion compared to 13 billion for 2009 this change is attributable to the following 

 

for additional information regarding our loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of debt discount net see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we consider all income sources including other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations for 2010 we recorded an income tax provision of 15 million primarily related to international and state income taxes we did not record an income tax provision for us federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

for 2009 we recorded an income tax benefit of 344 million including a noncash income tax benefit of 321 million on the loss from continuing operations with an offsetting noncash income tax expense of 321 million on other comprehensive income we did not record an income tax benefit for us federal income tax purposes in 2009 since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

at december 31 2010 we had 171 billion of us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards accordingly we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years our us federal pretax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2022 

results of operations — 2009 gaap compared to 2008 combined 

in this section we compare delta’s results of operations under gaap for the year ended december 31 2009 with delta’s results of operations on a combined basis for the year ended december 31 2008 for this purpose delta’s results of operations for 2008 on a combined basis add 1 delta’s results of operations under gaap for 2008 which includes northwest’s results of operations from october 30 to december 31 2008 and 2 northwest’s results of operations from january 1 to october 29 2008 this presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing delta’s financial performance in 2009 and 2008 

delta’s results of operations for 2008 on a combined basis are derived from our consolidated financial statements but are not presented in accordance with gaap certain of this information is considered “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission rules the nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 

operating revenue 

 

 

  mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to weakened demand for air travel from the global recession capacity reductions and the effects of the h1n1 virus on passenger travel passenger mile yield and prasm both declined 15 

 

  regional carriers  passenger revenue of regional carriers declined 804 million primarily as a result of a 13 decrease in passenger mile yield while traffic and capacity remained flat the decrease in passenger mile yield reflects a reduction in demand for air travel due to the global recession and an overall decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures 

  cargo  cargo revenue decreased due to capacity reductions significantly reduced cargo yields and international volume as a result of the global recession and lower fuel surcharges due to the yearoveryear decline in fuel prices during 2009 we retired our remaining 10 dedicated freighter aircraft which contributed to a 40 decline in capacity 

  other  other revenue increased 241 million primarily due to new or increased baggage handling fees and higher skymiles program revenue partially offset by decreased revenue from our alliance agreements and a reduction in our aircraft maintenance and repair service 

operating expense 

 

  aircraft fuel and related taxes  aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 50 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to 48 billion associated with lower average fuel prices and 858 million from a 7 decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions these decreases were partially offset by 14 billion in fuel hedge losses for 2009 compared to 666 million in fuel hedge losses for 2008 the fuel hedge losses in 2009 are primarily from hedges purchased in 2008 during the period fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise but instead declined 

  salaries and related costs  salaries and related costs increased 289 million due to 1 pay increases for pilot and nonpilot frontline employees 2 higher pension expense from a decline in the value of our defined benefit plan assets as a result of market conditions and 3 delta airline tickets awarded to employees as part of an employee recognition program these increases were partially offset by a 5 average decrease in headcount primarily related to workforce reduction programs 

  contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense decreased 844 million primarily due to decreases of 714 million associated with lower average fuel prices and 119 million from a 7 decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions 

  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased 784 million as a result of 641 million in impairment related charges recorded in the year ended december 31 2008 primarily related to certain definitelived intangible assets and aircraft and 125 million related to the december 2008 multiyear extension of our cobrand credit card relationship with american express the “american express agreement” extending the useful life of the american express agreement intangible asset to the date the contract expires 

  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 347 million primarily from capacity reductions 

  passenger commissions and other selling expenses passenger commissions and other selling expenses decreased 362 million primarily in connection with the passenger revenue decrease 

  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2008 we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions in addition the announcement of our intention to merge with northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of delta and northwest we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a noncash charge of 102 billion on a combined basis we also recorded a noncash charge of 955 million on a combined basis to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values 

  restructuring and mergerrelated items restructuring and mergerrelated items decreased 949 million primarily due to the following 

 

other expense income 

 

other expense net for 2009 was 13 billion compared to 12 billion for 2008 on a combined basis this change is primarily attributable to 1 a 200 million increase in interest expense from increased amortization of debt discount 2 a 151 million decrease in interest income primarily from significantly reduced shortterm interest rates 3 an 83 million noncash loss for the writeoff of the unamortized discount on the extinguishment of certain northwest debt and 4 a 421 million favorable change in miscellaneous net due to the following 

 

income taxes 

 

we consider all income sources including other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations for 2009 we recorded an income tax benefit of 344 million including a noncash income tax benefit of 321 million on the loss from continuing operations with an offsetting noncash income tax expense of 321 million on other comprehensive income we did not record an income tax benefit for us federal income tax purposes in 2009 since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 330 million for 2008 on a combined basis due to the impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets the impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit because goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes we did not record an income tax benefit for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the remaining loss for 2008 the deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements as of december 31 2010 we had 52 billion in unrestricted liquidity consisting of 36 billion in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 16 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities at december 31 2010 total debt and capital leases including current maturities was 153 billion a 19 billion reduction from december 31 2009 our ability to obtain additional financing if needed on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens 

  fleet strategy we continue to focus on investing in our existing fleet including investments in our domestic mainline aircraft to 1 add winglets to increase fuel efficiency and 2 expand the first class cabin on much of our domestic mainline fleet in response to business customer demand we are also investing in our international transoceanic aircraft to enhance our product by featuring full flat bed seats in businesselite and inseat audio and video in all cabins in addition we are making investments in our regional aircraft product to create a consistent experience by adding first class to 70 and 76 seat regional jets 

throughout 2010 we have been acquiring previously owned md90 aircraft at significantly lower ownership and total cost relative to comparable new aircraft and we will seek to acquire additional previously owned md90 aircraft in the future we are also evaluating the future replacement needs for our domestic mainline fleet if determined necessary we will seek to acquire previously owned aircraft or place an aircraft order to replace older less efficient aircraft such as the dc9 aircraft if an aircraft order is placed we would not expect deliveries of new aircraft to begin earlier than 2013 we have no immediate fleet renewal needs for international aircraft as previously announced we continue to substantially reduce our 50seat regional jet aircraft fleet retire our dc9 fleet and eliminate our regional turboprop fleet 

  jfk redevelopment john f kennedy international airport “jfk” is one of the world’s busiest airports in one of the most competitive airline markets we currently operate primarily at terminal 2 for domestic flights and terminal 3 which was constructed in 1960 for international flights under leases with the port authority of new york and new jersey “port authority” we also conduct some flights from terminal 4 which is operated by jfk international air terminal llc a private party under its lease with the port authority 

during the december 2010 quarter we began a redevelopment project that we believe will create a stateoftheart facility for us at jfk we estimate this project will cost approximately 12 billion and will be completed in stages over five years this project includes the 1 enhancement and expansion of terminal 4 including the construction of nine new gates 2 construction of a passenger connector between terminal 2 and terminal 4 3 demolition of the outdated terminal 3 facilities and 4 development of the terminal 3 site for aircraft parking positions upon completion of the terminal 4 expansion expected to occur in 2013 we will relocate our operations from terminal 3 to terminal 4 proceed with demolition activities in terminal 3 and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from terminals 2 and 4 once our project is complete we expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance including reduced taxi times and better ontime performance for additional information see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2010 that we expect will be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements among others in addition the table does not include expected significant cash payments which are generally ordinary course of business obligations that do not include contractual commitments 

the amounts presented are based on various estimates including estimates regarding the timing of payments prevailing interest rates volumes purchased the occurrence of certain events and other factors accordingly the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table 

during 2010 the following significant events impacted our contractual obligations 

 

 

  longterm debt principal amount represents scheduled principal payments on longterm debt reported on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 the table excludes 10 billion we received from american express for its advance purchase of skymiles because this obligation will be satisfied by american express’ use of skymiles over a specified period rather than by cash payments from us for additional information about our longterm debt and agreement with american express see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  longterm debt interest payments represents estimated interest payments under our longterm debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using libor at december 31 2010 for additional information see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  contract carrier obligations represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers excluding comair the reported amounts are based on 1 the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and 2 assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying for additional information about our capacity purchase agreements see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  operating lease payments includes our noncancelable operating leases for additional information see note 6 and note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  employee benefit obligations represents primarily 1 our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and 2 projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans for additional information about our defined benefit pension plans see “critical accounting policies and estimates” and note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  aircraft purchase commitments represents primarily our commitments to purchase 18 b7878 aircraft and 12 previously owned md90 aircraft the table excludes our orders for five a319100 aircraft and two a320200 aircraft because we have the right to cancel these orders for additional information see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  other obligations represents primarily estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services including but not limited to insurance outsourced human resource services marketing maintenance technology sponsorships and other third party services and products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates accordingly the actual results may differ materially from these estimates for a discussion of these and other accounting policies see note 1 of our notes to our consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

our frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” offers incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on delta regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements “contract carriers” and participating airlines as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we also sell mileage credits to nonairline businesses customers and other airlines mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on delta and participating airlines membership in our sky club and other program awards 

we use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits the fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sold mileage credits to other airlines 00054 per mile at december 31 2010 and is reevaluated at least annually under the residual method the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits and the mileage component of passenger ticket sales that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided the portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold is recognized in income when the related marketing services are provided and classified as other revenue for additional information see “recent accounting standards” 

for mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the estimate of breakage is based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years at december 31 2010 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 45 billion a hypothetical 1 change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 32 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2010 

fair value 

fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability a threetier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following valuation techniques market approach cost approach and income approach accordingly the actual amounts may differ materially from the estimates see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis the annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is october 1 

as of october 1 2010 the date of our most recent goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment tests the fair value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded the carrying values the key assumptions included 1 our projected revenues expenses and cash flows 2 an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 10 3 assumed discount rates ranging from 10 to 15 depending on the asset and 4 a tax rate of 392 these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates 

changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in impairment factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 an increase in fuel prices 3 declining passenger mile yields 4 lower passenger demand as a result of the weakened us and global economy 5 interruption to our operations due to an employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 6 changes to the regulatory environment and 7 consolidation of competitors in the airline industry 

  goodwill goodwill reflects 1 the excess of the reorganization value of delta over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities from the adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy adjusted for impairment and 2 the excess of purchase price over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from northwest in the merger 

in evaluating goodwill for impairment we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering 1 market capitalization 2 controlling interest premiums 3 recent market transactions 4 projected discounted future cash flows and 5 other factors if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value no further testing is required if however the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 

  identifiable intangible assets identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and acquired in the merger indefinitelived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes slots the delta tradename and the skyteam alliance definitelived intangible assets consist primarily of marketing agreements and contracts and are amortized on a straightline basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts 

we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 potential lease savings from owning the assets 3 hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 4 projected discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 

as of october 1 2010 the date of our most recent impairment test we determined our pacific routes and slots continue to have an indefinite life and are not presently impaired we considered that the us and japan signed an open skies agreement in october 2010 we currently believe this agreement will not have a significant longterm impact on our pacific routes and slots see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived assets 

our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 203 billion on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 this value is based on various factors including the assets’ estimated useful lives and salvage values we record impairment losses on flight equipment and other longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 deciding to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations 2 significant changes in the estimated useful life 3 operational downsizing 4 significant changes in the projected cash flows 5 permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and 6 changes to the regulatory environment for longlived assets held for sale we record impairment losses when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell we discontinue depreciation of longlived assets when these assets are classified as held for sale 

to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if an impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available for additional information see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income tax valuation allowance and contingencies 

we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical financial results our industry’s historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies we cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets accordingly we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 

our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities although the positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that taxing authorities may challenge these positions which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest we review and adjust the reserves as circumstances warrant and events occur such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations conclusion of tax audits a change in exposure based on current calculations identification of new issues release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known for additional information about income taxes see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

defined benefit pension plans 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our eligible employees and retirees these plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals as of december 31 2010 the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was 93 billion during 2010 we contributed 728 million to these plans and recorded 367 million of expense in salaries and related costs on our consolidated statement of operations in 2011 we estimate we will contribute approximately 600 million to these plans and that our expense will be approximately 300 million the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the assets 

  discount rate we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate of 569 and 593 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 593 to 719 between 2008 and 2010 due to remeasurements throughout the year 

  expected longterm rate of return the expected longterm rate of return on the assets currently approximately 9 is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market returns and volatility data with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts modest excess return expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually these assumptions are largely based on the asset category rateofreturn assumptions developed annually with our pension plan investment advisors however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds a 9 annualized return target 

the impact of a 050 change in these assumptions is shown in the table below 

 

  funding our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen delta elected the alternative funding rules under which the unfunded liability for a plan 1 may be funded over a fixed 17year period beginning at the election date and 2 is calculated using a fixed interest rate of 885the alternative funding rules apply to our defined benefit pension plan for eligible nonpilot premerger delta employees and retirees effective april 1 2007 and to our defined benefit pension plans for eligible premerger northwest employees and retirees effective october 1 2006 

while the pension protection act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants 

for additional information about our defined benefit pension plans see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting standards 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board issued “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” the standard revises guidance on the determination of when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting and the allocation of consideration among separately identified deliverables it also expands disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s multiple element revenue arrangements the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 

we adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning january 1 2011 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements although it could significantly impact our future financial results as we enter into new or materially modified revenue arrangements related to our skymiles program 

supplemental information 

we sometimes use information that is derived from our consolidated financial statements but that is not presented in accordance with gaap certain of this information is considered “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission rules the nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 

the following table shows a reconciliation of a nongaap financial measure to the corresponding gaap financial measure we use this measure because management believes the exclusion of special items is helpful to investors to evaluate our recurring operational performance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders’ equity 

the following sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

fuel price risk 

our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices in an effort to manage our exposure to this risk we periodically enter into derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel call option collar and swap contracts to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements including those of our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements 

as of january 31 2011 our open fuel hedge position is as follows 

 

for 2010 aircraft fuel and related taxes including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements accounted for 89 billion or 30 of our total operating expense including 89 million of net fuel hedge costs the following table shows the projected impact to aircraft fuel expense and fuel hedge margin for 2011 based on the impact of our open fuel hedge contracts at january 31 2011 assuming the following per barrel prices of crude oil 

 

 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates at december 31 2010 we had 86 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 68 billion of variablerate longterm debt an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 320 million at december 31 2010 and would have increased annual interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 55 million inclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge instruments 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenue and expense our largest exposures come from the japanese yen and canadian dollar to manage exchange rate risk we attempt to execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our results of operations 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures

changes in internal control 

except as set forth below during the three months ended december 31 2010 we did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

on october 29 2008 a whollyowned subsidiary of ours merged with and into northwest on december 31 2009 northwest merged with and into delta ending northwest’s separate existence we are currently integrating policies processes people technology and operations for the combined company management will continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as we execute merger integration activities 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 using the criteria issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework based on that evaluation management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010

 item 1 business 

general 

we provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states and around the world in october 2008 a whollyowned subsidiary of ours merged with and into northwest airlines corporation “northwest” as a result of this merger northwest and its subsidiaries including northwest airlines inc “nwa” became our whollyowned subsidiaries on december 31 2009 nwa merged with and into delta ending nwa’s existence as a separate entity we anticipate that we will complete the integration of nwa’s operations into delta during 2010 

we are incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware our principal executive offices are located at hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport in atlanta georgia the “atlanta airport” our telephone number is 404 7152600 and our internet address is wwwdeltacom information contained on this website is not part of and is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k 

financial strategies 

  complete the integration of northwest  we believe the northwest merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices invest in our fleet improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives we also believe the merger will generate approximately 2 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization a more comprehensive and diversified route system and reduced overhead and improved operational efficiency 

  rightsize our operations in response to the global recession and high fuel prices we reduced domestic and international capacity to better match capacity with demand we have focused on removing the associated capacityrelated costs including aircraft fleet and staffing to reduce fleet costs we removed 18 mainline passenger aircraft from the fleet during 2009 retired our entire fleet of b747200f freighter aircraft during 2009 and plan to remove over 30 regional jets from our network beginning in mid2009 and continuing through early 2011 we have reduced staffing primarily through voluntary reduction programs as well as normal attrition at december 31 2009 our total workforce was 4 lower than the combined workforce of delta and nwa at december 31 2008 

  improve our operating margins we believe that the scope of our network combined with investments we are making in our product and customer service will enable us to generate a unit revenue premium to the industry and that our cost structure allows us to generate highly competitive unit costs both of which provide the tools to improve our operating margins by strengthening our network entering into joint ventures and expanding our alliances we believe we are better able to improve unit revenues and while our consolidated nonfuel unit costs are the lowest among the major network carriers we have additional improvement opportunities as we reduce costs associated with rightsizing our business increase productivity and realize merger synergies 

  strengthen our balance sheet we currently and will continue to prudently manage costs and free cash flow to conserve liquidity we finished 2009 with 54 billion in unrestricted liquidity consisting of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and undrawn revolving credit facility capacity we have no immediate need for significant aircraft purchases and currently have limited aircraft capital expenditures planned for the next three years we will continue to focus on cost discipline and cash flow generation toward our goal of further strengthening our balance sheet 

2010 flight plan 

providing a safe secure operation is our first and most fundamental obligation to our customers and employees as well as to the communities we serve the key goals of our 2010 flight plan include 1 positioning delta as the global airline of choice 2 enhancing our customer service 3 promoting positive employee relations 4 building a diversified profitable worldwide network and global alliance and 5 delivering industryleading financial results 

airline operations 

our global route network gives us a presence in every major domestic and international market our route network is centered around the hub system we operate at airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city parischarles de gaulle amsterdam and tokyonarita each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to domestic and international cities and to other hubs our network is supported by a fleet of aircraft that is varied in terms of size and capabilities giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network 

expanding our presence in new york city through increased focus on corporate customers expanded and improved airport facilities and increased and expanded service into and out of new york city is a key component of our network strategy for example we continue to make investments in our international operations at new yorkjfk and explore longterm options to upgrade the facility in addition in august 2009 we announced our intention to make new york’s laguardia airport a domestic hub through a slot transaction with us airways the agreement calls for us airways to transfer 125 operating slot pairs to us at laguardia and for us to transfer 42 operating slot pairs to us airways at reagan national airport in washington dc we also plan to swap gates at laguardia to consolidate all of our operations including the delta shuttle into an expanded main terminal facility with 11 additional gates the united states department of transportation “dot” has issued a tentative order on the transaction that would require the divestiture of 20 slot pairs at laguardia and 14 slot pairs at reagan national we and us airways are reviewing the tentative order to determine our next steps 

other key characteristics of our route network include 

 

international alliances 

we have bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions common use of airport gates and ticket counters ticket office colocation and other marketing agreements these alliances often present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing 

our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under international codesharing arrangements we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s designator code 

we have international codeshare arrangements with aeromexico air france alitalia avianca china airlines china southern csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air malev hungarian airlines royal air maroc and virgin blue and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with some of these airlines 

  skyteam  in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam global airline alliance the other full members of skyteam are aeroflot aeromexico air france alitalia china southern csa czech airlines klm and korean air one goal of skyteam is to link the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations 

we have received antitrust immunity from the dot that enables us and our immunized alliance partners air france klm alitalia csa czech airlines and korean air to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales marketing and discount programs for customers in july 2009 delta and virgin blue international airlines vaustralia virgin blue airlines pacific blue airlines australia and pacific blue airlines new zealand filed an application with the dot for antitrust immunity 

  air france klm joint venture  in addition to being members in skyteam with air france and klm both of which are subsidiaries of the same holding company we have a transatlantic joint venture agreement with air france and klm this agreement provides for the sharing of revenues and costs on transatlantic routes as well as coordinated pricing scheduling and product development on included routes pursuant to this joint venture we and air france klm operate an extensive transatlantic network primarily on routes between north america and europe and secondarily on routes between north america and africa the middle east and india and routes between europe and central america and several countries in northern south america 

domestic alliances 

we have entered into a marketing alliance with alaska and horizon which includes mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements in 2009 we enhanced our alliance agreement with alaska and horizon to provide for more extensive cooperation with respect to our west coast presence 

we also have frequent flyer and reciprocal lounge agreements with hawaiian airlines and codesharing agreements with american eagle airlines “american eagle” us helicopter and midwest airlines these marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks 

regional carriers 

we have air service agreements with multiple domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in smalland mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to increase the number of flights we have available in certain locations to better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets approximately 22 of our passenger revenue in 2009 related to flying by regional air carriers 

through our regional carrier program we have contractual arrangements with 10 regional carriers to operate regional jet and in certain cases turboprop aircraft using our “dl” designator code in addition to our whollyowned subsidiaries comair compass and mesaba we have contractual arrangements with atlantic southeast airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest inc “skywest” skywest airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest chautauqua airlines inc a subsidiary of republic airways holdings inc “republic holdings” shuttle america corporation a subsidiary of republic holdings freedom airlines inc a subsidiary of mesa air group inc pinnacle airlines inc and american eagle 

with the exception of american eagle and a portion of skywest airlines as described below these agreements are capacity purchase arrangements under which we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers’ flights operating under our “dl” designator code and we are entitled to all ticket cargo and mail revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least 10 years which grant us the option to extend the initial term certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates 

our arrangements with american eagle limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of the flights operated for us by skywest airlines are structured as revenue proration agreements these proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

frequent flyer program 

our skymiles® frequent flyer program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on delta the skymiles program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta’s regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies and telecommunication services in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our delta sky clubs® and for other program participant awards mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject to capacitycontrolled seating program accounts with no activity for 12 consecutive months after enrollment are deleted miles will not expire so long as at least once every two years the participant 1 takes a qualifying flight on delta a delta connection carrier or other participating airlines 2 earns miles through one of our program participants 3 buys miles from delta or 4 redeems miles for any program award 

cargo 

through the strength of our global network our cargo operations are able to connect all of the world’s major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets primarily through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft we are a member of skyteam cargo a global airline cargo alliance the alliance whose other members are aeromexico cargo air france cargo alitalia cargo csa czech airlines cargo klm cargo and korean air cargo offers a global network spanning six continents this alliance offers cargo customers a consistent international product line and the partners work to jointly improve their efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace 

mro 

our maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” operations known as delta techops is the largest airline mro in north america in addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of approximately 800 aircraft delta techops serves more than 150 aviation and airline customers from around the world delta techops employs approximately 8800 maintenance professionals and is one of the most experienced mro providers in the world 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2007 through 2009 

 

 

our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

we use derivative instruments which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

competition 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city parischarles de gaulle amsterdam and tokyonarita either directly at those airports or from the hubs of other airlines that compete on a connecting basis we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators our ability to compete effectively depends in significant part on our ability to maintain a cost structure that is competitive with other carriers 

in addition we compete with foreign carriers for us passengers traveling to international destinations as well as between foreign points international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united air lines continental airlines lufthansa german airlines air canada and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways qantas and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaty with the member states of the european union has accelerated this trend japan has reached agreement in principle with the united states on an open skies agreement contingent upon the successful completion of dot alliance approval for its carriers through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities through alliances with international carriers 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration the “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the us president for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limitedentry frequency awards issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time notably the us and japan have begun steps to revise their bilateral agreement 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan national in washington dc laguardia and jfk in new york and newark our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities similarly our operations at tokyo’s narita airport london’s gatwick and heathrow airports and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport association’s worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we recently filed an application with the dot to offer customers nonstop service between tokyo’s haneda airport and seattle detroit los angeles and honolulu we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

  noise  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

  emissions  the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with the existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date icao has adopted additional aircraft engine emissions standards applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 but the epa has not yet proposed a rule that incorporates these new icao standards 

concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad as a result we may become subject to taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions which could result in taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations ongoing discussions between the united states and other nations including the discussions that resulted in an accord reached at the united nations climate change conference 2009 in copenhagen in december 2009 may lead to international treaties focusing on greenhouse gas emissions 

the european union has adopted the most significant emissions regulatory system by publishing a directive requiring its member countries to implement regulations including aviation in the european union’s emissions trading system “ets” under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union will be subject to the ets and beginning in 2012 may be required to purchase emissions allowances or credits if the airline exceeds the number of free credits allocated to it under the ets we expect that such a system would impose significant costs on our operations in the european union under the ets each airline is required to file emissions plans with a specific member country prior to nwa ceasing existence as a separate entity we filed emissions plans in germany with respect to delta and the netherlands with respect to nwa under protest the air transport association and three us carriers have filed an action in the united kingdom challenging the legality of the ets on various grounds however airlines will be required to comply with the ets unless interim relief is granted 

cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the united states in addition other legislative or regulatory action including by the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible in particular the epa has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft in the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the us or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the european union where we operate or where we may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry at this time we cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulation would apportion costs between one or more jurisdictions in which we operate flights under these systems certain credits may be available to reduce the costs of permits in order to mitigate the impact of such regulations on consumers but we cannot predict whether we or the airline industry in general will have access to offsets or credits we are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments in addition to direct costs such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts we have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain elements of our fleet and with newer more fuel efficient aircraft in addition we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions we are also supporting efforts to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the us as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment 

  other environmental matters  we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and drinking water 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international range aircraft from october 1 2009 until september 30 2010 as of october 1 2009 the following numbers of our international range aircraft are available for craf activation 

 

the craf program has only been activated twice both times at the stage i level since it was created in 1951 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class under the nmb’s usual rules a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of those employees vote for union representation a certified labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the us president appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2009 we had 81106 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 39 of these employees were represented by unions including the following domestic employee groups 

 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our airline subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes 

integration of a number of the workgroups including pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians has been successfully completed completion of the integration of certain workgroups including flight attendants airport employees and reservations employees will require the resolution of representation issues we cannot predict when these representation issues will be resolved however as a result of our obtaining a single operating certificate from the faa completing the merger of the nwa reservations system into delta’s system and the merger of nwa into delta we believe we can achieve many of the synergies of integrating the premerger northwest operations into delta’s before the remaining employee representation issues are resolved 

under procedures that have been utilized by the nmb each labor union that represented usbased employees at premerger delta or nwa as well as other groups of employees with a sufficient showing of interest may invoke the nmb’s jurisdiction to address representation issues arising from the merger once its jurisdiction is invoked the nmb’s rules call for it to first determine whether the airlines have combined or will combine to form a single carrier on january 7 2009 the nmb ruled that delta and nwa constitute a single transportation system for representation purposes under the railway labor act in response to applications filed by certain of the premerger unions at delta and nwa 

the nmb has utilized certain procedures to address and resolve representation issues arising from airline mergers which generally have included the following 

 

 

 

based upon these procedures representation and related issues have been resolved in usbased workgroups represented by six of the eight labor unions at delta and nwa premerger the nmb recently issued a formal proposal to change the voting rules for representation elections in the airline industry to provide that a majority of votes cast rather than a majority of votes eligible to be cast is necessary to certify a union to represent a craft or class of employees concurrent with the nmb’s proposal the two remaining premerger nwa unions the association of flight attendantscwa which represented flight attendants at premerger nwa and the international association of machinists which represented various categories of ground employees at premerger nwa withdrew applications that they had filed with the national mediation board to resolve postmerger representation issues at delta while it is unclear when representation issues will be resolved in those workgroups we are proceeding with a substantial portion of our operational integration 

if a labor union is certified to represent a combined group postmerger the terms and conditions of employment of the combined work group ultimately will be subject to negotiations toward a joint collective bargaining agreement completing joint collective bargaining agreements covering combined work groups that choose to be represented by a labor union could take significant time which could delay or impede our ability to achieve targeted synergies from the merger 

with respect to integration of seniority lists where the two employee groups in a craft or class have different representation status federal law requires that seniority integration be governed by the procedures first issued by the civil aeronautics board in the alleghenymohawk merger—known as the alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions in general alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions require that seniority be integrated in a “fair and equitable” manner and that any disputes not resolved by negotiations may be submitted to binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator this requirement is consistent with the seniority protection policy that has been adopted by the delta board of directors where both groups are represented by the same union prior to the merger seniority integration is governed by the union’s bylaws and policies the integration of the seniority lists of the pilots of delta and nwa as well as flight dispatchers meteorologists and aircraft maintenance technicians and related technical operations employees have been resolved

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results likewise significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and spiked at record high levels in 2008 before falling dramatically during the latter part of 2008 in 2009 our average fuel price per gallon was 215 in 2008 our average fuel price per gallon was 316 a 41 increase from an average price of 224 in 2007 which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier fuel costs represented 29 38 and 31 of our operating expense in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively total operating expense for 2008 reflects a 73 billion noncash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and 11 billion in primarily noncash mergerrelated charges including these charges fuel costs accounted for 28 of total operating expense in 2008 fuel costs have had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited by the competitive nature of the airline industry we often have not been able to increase our fares to offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future 

in addition our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices we use derivative instruments which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure depending on the type of hedging instrument used our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be limited 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us 

the global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel and may create challenges for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as the effects of the global economic recession have been felt in our domestic and international markets we have experienced significantly weaker demand for air travel our demand began to slow during the december 2008 quarter and global economic conditions in 2009 substantially reduced us airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result we reduced our consolidated capacity by 6 in 2009 compared to the combined capacity of delta and northwest during 2008 demand for air travel could remain weak if an economic recovery is slow or even fall further if a recession returns and overall demand could fall lower than we are able prudently to reduce capacity the weakness in the united states and international economies is having a significant negative impact on our results of operations and could continue to have a significant negative impact on our future results of operations 

the global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 

the credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have an impact on our business and our financial condition in particular the financial crisis and economic downturn resulted in broadly lower investment asset returns and values including in the defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor for eligible employees and 

retirees as of december 31 2009 the defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately 170 billion and were funded through assets with a value of approximately 76 billion we estimate that our funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans which are governed by erisa and have been frozen for future accruals are approximately 720 million in 2010 the significant level of required funding is due primarily to the decline in the investment markets in 2008 which negatively affected the value of our pension assets estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control including among other things the market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations 

our obligation to post collateral in connection with our fuel hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our shortterm liquidity 

under fuel hedge contracts that we may enter into from time to time counterparties to those contracts may require us to fund the margin associated with any loss position on the contracts for example at december 31 2008 our counterparties required us to fund 12 billion of fuel hedge margin however at december 31 2009 counterparties were required to fund us a net 10 million if fuel prices fall significantly below the levels at the time we enter into hedging contracts we may be required to post a significant amount of collateral which could have an impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 

we have substantial indebtedness which could 

 

in addition a substantial level of indebtedness particularly because substantially all of our assets are currently subject to liens could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business these liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions industry trends performance and many other factors not within our control 

agreements governing our debt including credit agreements and indentures include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum unrestricted cash reserves andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time including due to factors that are not under our control resulting in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications 

the credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders or the trustee could among other things declare outstanding amounts due and payable and our cash may become restricted we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants and other personnel as of december 31 2009 approximately 39 of our workforce was unionized strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted 

in addition if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

the ability to realize fully the anticipated benefits of our merger with northwest may depend on the successful integration of the businesses of delta and northwest 

our merger with northwest involved the combination of two companies which operated as independent public companies prior to the merger we are devoting significant attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations in order to achieve the benefits of the merger including expected synergies if we are unable to integrate our business practices and operations in a manner that allows us to achieve the anticipated revenue and cost synergies or if achievement of such synergies takes longer or costs more than expected the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees diversion of management’s attention the disruption or interruption of or the loss of momentum in our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results we expect to incur total cash costs of approximately 500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines 

completion of the integration of the delta and nwa workforces may present significant challenges 

the successful integration of the premerger northwest operations into delta and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combination depend significantly on integrating the premerger delta and nwa employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations while integration of a number of the workgroups including pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians has been successfully completed completion of the integration of certain workgroups including flight attendants airport employees and reservations employees of the two premerger airlines will require the resolution of potentially difficult issues including but not limited to the process and timing for determining whether the combined postmerger workgroups wish to have union representation unexpected delay expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces could impact the expected synergies from the merger and affect our financial performance 

interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city parischarles de gaulle amsterdam and tokyonarita each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at the atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology or integrate the systems and technologies of delta and northwest our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected in addition we may face challenges associated with integrating complex systems and technologies that supported the separate operations of delta and northwest if we are unable to manage these challenges effectively our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs our technology systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business 

if we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances the initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards our credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash if circumstances were to occur that would allow american express or our visamastercard processor to initiate a holdback the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability the insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate in the event that the insurance is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation 

in general under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses “nols” to offset future taxable income in general an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders generally 5 shareholders applying certain lookthrough rules increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period generally three years 

as of december 31 2009 delta reported a consolidated federal and state nol carryforward of approximately 173 billion both delta and northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code as a result of the merger northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change delta also experienced a subsequent ownership change on december 17 2008 as a result of the merger the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period 

the delta and northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability to utilize prechange nols that were not subject to limitation and could further limit the ability to utilize nols that were already subject to limitation limitations imposed on the ability to use nols to offset future taxable income could cause us federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such nols to expire unused in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes nols generated subsequent to december 17 2008 are not limited 

our merger with northwest affects the comparability of our historical financial results 

on october 29 2008 a subsidiary of delta merged with and into northwest our historical financial results under gaap include the results of northwest for periods after october 29 2008 but not for periods before october 29 2008 accordingly while our financial results for the year ended december 31 2009 include the results of northwest for the entire period our financial results for the year ended december 31 2008 include the results of northwest only for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 this complicates your ability to compare our results of operations and financial condition for periods that include northwest’s results with periods that do not 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city parischarles de gaulle amsterdam and tokyonarita either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators 

lowcost carriers including southwest airtran and jetblue have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the united states and on other network carriers in the domestic market in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in light of increased jet fuel costs and other issues in recent years we expect consolidation to occur in the airline industry as a result of consolidation we may face significant competition from larger carriers that may be able to generate higher amounts of revenue and compete more efficiently 

in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines continental lufthansa german airlines and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways and others have also significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies agreement between the united states and the member states of the european union has accelerated this trend similarly the recent open skies agreement between the united states and japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets 

the rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the rapid spread of a contagious illness such as the h1n1 flu virus can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations acceleration of the spread of h1n1 during the flu season in the northern hemisphere could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for air travel and as a result our financial results in addition to the impact that we experienced during the spring of 2009 moreover our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness similarly travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which resulted in industrywide liquidity issues additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues for example the aviation and transportation security act which became law in november 2001 mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax the proposed ticket tax increase if implemented could negatively impact our results of operations 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast united states have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines furthermore events related to extreme weather delays have caused congress and the dot to consider proposals related to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions the recent enactment of such a regulation by the dot could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances 

future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the united states we expect that such a system will impose significant costs on our operations in the european union other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the coverage currently extends through august 31 2010 the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially if available such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all resulting in an interruption to our operations

the above table 

 

aircraft commitments 

future purchase commitments for aircraft as of december 31 2009 are estimated to total approximately 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 800 million of the 11 billion is associated with the purchase of 20 b737800 aircraft for which we have entered into definitive agreements to sell to third parties immediately following delivery of those aircraft to us by the manufacturer we have not received any notice that these parties have defaulted on their purchase obligations the remaining commitments relate to the purchase of two b777200lr aircraft two b737800 aircraft and 11 previously owned md90 aircraft we have no aircraft purchase commitments after december 31 2010 

as of december 31 2009 we have financing commitments from third parties or with respect to 20 of the 22 b737800 aircraft referred to above definitive agreements to sell all aircraft subject to purchase commitments except for nine of the 11 previously owned md90 aircraft under these financing commitments third parties have agreed to finance on a longterm basis a substantial portion of the purchase price of the covered aircraft 

our aircraft purchase commitments described above do not include our orders for 

 

aircraft on option 

our options to purchase additional aircraft as of december 31 2009 are shown in the following table 

 

 

ground facilities 

we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases we own our atlanta reservations center other real property in atlanta and the former nwa headquarters building and flight training buildings which are located near the minneapolisst paul international airport other owned facilities include reservations centers in tampa florida minot north dakota and chisholm minnesota and a data processing center in eagan minnesota we also own property in tokyo including a 13acre site in downtown tokyo and a 33acre land parcel 512room hotel and flight kitchen located near tokyo’s narita international airport 

we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve at most airports we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other improvements and facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft these leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30 years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement examples of major leases and use agreements at hub or other significant airports that will expire in the next few years include among others 1 our salt lake city international airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2010 and 2 our memphis international airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2010 we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports including among others 1 our main atlanta maintenance base 2 our atlanta air cargo facilities and our hangar and air cargo facilities at the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport salt lake city international airport detroit metropolitan international airport minneapolisst paul international airport and seattletacoma international airport our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities including in some cases amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction we also lease marketing ticketing and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms 

in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

the city of atlanta is currently implementing portions of a 10 year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport implementation of the cip should increase the number of flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays the cip includes among other things a 9000 foot fullservice runway that opened in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements the cip will not be complete until at least 2012 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds certain elements of the cip have been delayed some may be eliminated and there is no assurance that the cip will be fully implemented failure to implement certain portions of the cip in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at the atlanta airport 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

first bag fee antitrust litigation 

in may june and july 2009 a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the us district courts for the northern district of georgia the middle district of florida and the district of nevada against delta and airtran airways “airtran” 

in these cases the plaintiffs originally alleged that delta and airtran engaged in collusive behavior in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in november 2008 based upon certain public statements made in october 2008 by airtran’s ceo at an analyst conference concerning fees for the first checked bag delta’s imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on november 4 2008 and airtran’s imposition of a similar fee on november 12 2008 the plaintiffs sought to assert claims on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the fist bag fee after december 5 2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages all of these cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the northern district of georgia by the multidistrict litigation “mdl” panel 

in february 2010 the plaintiffs in the mdl proceeding filed a consolidated amended class action complaint which substantially expanded the scope of the original complaint in the consolidated amended complaint the plaintiffs add new allegations concerning alleged signaling by both delta and airtran based upon statements made to the investment community by both carriers relating to industry capacity levels during 20082009 the plaintiffs also add a new cause of action against delta alleging attempted monopolization in violation of sherman act § 2 paralleling a claim previously asserted against airtran but not delta 

we believe the claims in these cases are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

chapter 11 proceedings 

on september 14 2005 delta and substantially all of its subsidiaries the “delta debtors” filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court on april 25 2007 the bankruptcy court entered an order approving and confirming the plan of reorganization and the plan of reorganization became effective allowing the delta debtors to emerge from bankruptcy on april 30 2007 the reorganization cases were jointly administered under the caption “in re delta air lines inc et al case no 0517923ash” as of the date of the chapter 11 filing then pending litigation was generally stayed and absent further order of the bankruptcy court most parties may not take any action to recover on prepetition claims against the delta debtors 

delta familycare savings plan litigation 

on march 16 2005 a retired delta employee filed an amended class action complaint in the us district court for the northern district of georgia against delta and certain current and former delta officers and directors on behalf of himself and other participants in the delta familycare savings plan “savings plan” the amended complaint alleges that the defendants were fiduciaries of the savings plan and as such breached their fiduciary duties under erisa to the plaintiff class by 1 allowing class members to direct their contributions under the savings plan to a fund invested in delta common stock and 2 continuing to hold delta’s contributions to the savings plan in delta’s common and preferred stock the amended complaint seeks damages unspecified in amount but equal to the total loss of value in the participants’ accounts from september 2000 through september 2004 from the investment in delta stock defendants deny that there was any breach of fiduciary duty the district court stayed the action against delta due to delta’s chapter 11 proceedings and granted a motion to dismiss filed by the individual defendants the bankruptcy court has ruled that a class claim filed against delta in its chapter 11 proceedings will be subordinated to any claim related to equity interests in delta which did not receive any distribution pursuant to the plan of reorganization the plaintiff has appealed this order 

canadian passenger surcharge antitrust litigation 

on july 31 2009 two parallel putative class actions were filed against a number of canadian asian european and us carriers including delta in the ontario superior court of justice both allege that the defendants colluded to fix the price of passenger surcharges in canadaasia and canadaeurope markets respectively there are no allegations in the complaints of any specific act by delta in furtherance of either conspiracy the complaints seek damages in excess of 100 million we believe the allegations against delta are without merit and intend to vigorously defend these cases

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general information 

we provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states “us” and around the world on october 29 2008 the “closing date” a whollyowned subsidiary of ours merged the “merger” with and into northwest airlines corporation on the closing date northwest airlines corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries including northwest airlines inc collectively “northwest” became whollyowned subsidiaries of delta on december 31 2009 northwest airlines inc merged with and into delta as a result of this merger northwest airlines inc ceased to exist as a separate entity we believe the merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices invest in our fleet improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” in accordance with gaap our financial results include the results of northwest for the periods after the closing date but not for periods on or before the closing date our financial results under gaap for the year ended december 31 2009 include the results of northwest for the full year in contrast our financial results under gaap for the year ended december 31 2008 include the results of northwest only from october 30 to december 31 2008 accordingly our financial results under gaap for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 are not comparable 

in the accompanying “financial highlights — 2009 gaap compared to 2008 combined” and “results of operations — 2009 gaap compared to 2008 combined” we sometimes use information that is derived from our consolidated financial statements but that is not presented in accordance with gaap certain of this information is considered “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission rules these nongaap financial measures include financial information for the year ended december 31 2008 presented on a combined basis which means the financial results for premerger delta and premerger northwest are combined beginning january 1 2008 we believe this presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing delta’s financial performance in 2009 and 2008 see “results of operations — 2009 gaap compared to 2008 combined” and “supplemental information” below for the reasons we use combined and other nongaap financial measures as well as a reconciliation to the corresponding measures under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 

financial highlights — 2009 gaap compared to 2008 combined 

for 2009 we reported a net loss of 12 billion these results reflect significant weakness in the airline revenue environment due to the global recession and 14 billion in fuel hedge losses our net loss for the year also includes a 407 million charge for mergerrelated items a 321 million noncash income tax benefit and an 83 million noncash loss on the extinguishment of debt 

total operating revenue declined 62 billion or 18 in 2009 on a 6 decrease in system capacity or available seat mile “asms” compared with 2008 on a combined basis passenger revenue accounted for 59 billion of the decrease passenger revenue per asm “prasm” declined 14 on a 14 decrease in passenger mile yield the decrease in passenger mile yield reflects 1 significantly reduced demand particularly in international markets 2 a reduction in business demand 3 competitive pricing pressures and 4 lower fuel surcharges due to the yearoveryear decline on fuel prices 

volatile fuel prices continue to represent a significant risk to our business and the airline industry as a whole while our fuel cost per gallon declined 35 in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis contributing to 54 billion in lower fuel expense excluding the marktomarket adjustments related to fuel hedges settling in future periods crude oil prices have risen 78 from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 

we have focused on maintaining a competitive cost structure through disciplined spending productivity initiatives and accelerating merger synergies our consolidated operating cost per asm “casm” excluding special items as defined in “supplemental information” below and fuel expense increased 4 on a 6 lower capacity in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis the increase primarily reflects an increase in pension expense from a decrease in value in pension trust assets due to declines in the financial markets during 2008 

at december 31 2009 we had 47 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and 685 million in undrawn revolving credit facilities in 2009 we completed 32 billion in financing transactions for additional information regarding these financing transactions see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

business overview 

  recent initiatives we believe that our global network hub structure and alliances with other airlines enables us to offer customers a service which results in a competitive advantage over other domestic and international airlines in 2009 we implemented a joint venture with air franceklm that further strengthens our transatlantic network expanded our alliance agreement with alaska airlines and horizon air to enhance our west coast presence and received us department of transportation approval for a codesharing agreement with virgin blue which will expand our network between the us and australia and the south pacific 

expanding our presence in new york city through increased corporate sales improved facilities and increased and new service from new york is a key component of our network strategy for example we continue to make investments in our international operation at new yorkjfk and explore longterm options to upgrade the facility in addition in august 2009 we announced our intention to make new york’s laguardia airport a domestic hub through a slot transaction with us airways the agreement calls for us airways to transfer 125 operating slot pairs to us at laguardia and for us to transfer 42 operating slot pairs to us airways at reagan national airport in washington dc we also plan to swap gates at laguardia to consolidate all of our operations including the delta shuttle into an expanded main terminal facility with 11 additional gates the us department of transportation has issued a tentative order on the transaction that would require the divestiture of 20 slot pairs at laguardia and 14 slot pairs at reagan national we and us airways are reviewing the tentative order to determine our next steps 

we also plan to invest 1 billion through mid2013 to improve the customer experience and the efficiency of our aircraft fleet planned enhancements include installing full flatbed seats in businesselite on 90 transoceanic aircraft adding inseat audio and video throughout economy class on 68 widebody aircraft adding first class cabins to 66 crj700 aircraft and installing winglets on more than 170 aircraft to extend aircraft range and increase fuel efficiency 

  merger synergies as a result of our integration efforts we achieved more than 700 million in merger synergy benefits in 2009 and we are targeting an additional 600 million in merger synergy benefits in 2010 in 2009 we completed a significant portion of our merger integration including combining frequent flyer programs consolidating and rebranding all airport facilities and achieving a single operating certificate from the federal aviation administration our ability to fully realize targeted annual synergies of 2 billion by 2012 is dependent on various factors including the integration of technologies of the two premerger airlines which we expect to occur in the first half of 2010 in january 2010 we completed the integration of the northwest reservations system including the transition of northwest flights and passenger reservations into the delta system 

results of operations — 2009 gaap compared to 2008 combined 

in this section we compare delta’s results of operations under gaap for the year ended december 31 2009 with delta’s results on a combined basis for the year ended december 31 2008 

as discussed in “general information” above delta’s results of operations for 2008 on a combined basis add 1 delta’s results of operations under gaap for 2008 which includes northwest’s results from october 30 to december 31 2008 and 2 northwest’s results from january 1 to october 29 2008 we believe this presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing delta’s financial performance in 2009 and 2008 

operating revenue 

 

 

  mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to weakened demand for air travel from the global recession capacity reductions and the effects of the h1n1 virus on passenger travel passenger mile yield and prasm both declined 15 

 

  regional carriers  passenger revenue of regional carriers declined 804 million primarily as a result of a 13 decrease in passenger mile yield while traffic and capacity remained flat the decrease in passenger mile yield reflects 1 a reduction in demand for air travel due to the global recession and 2 an overall decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures 

  cargo  cargo revenue decreased due to capacity reductions significantly reduced cargo yields and international volume as a result of the global recession and lower fuel surcharges due to the yearoveryear decline in fuel prices during 2009 we retired our remaining 10 dedicated freighter b747200f aircraft which contributed to a 40 decline in capacity 

  other net  other net revenue increased 241 million primarily due to new or increased baggage handling fees and higher skymiles program revenue partially offset by decreased revenue from our alliance agreements and a reduction in our aircraft maintenance and repair service 

operating expense 

 

  aircraft fuel and related taxes  aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 50 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to 1 48 billion associated with lower average fuel prices and 2 858 million from a 7 decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions these decreases were partially offset by 14 billion in fuel hedge losses for 2009 compared to 666 million in fuel hedge losses for 2008 the fuel hedge losses in 2009 are primarily from hedges purchased in 2008 during the period fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise 

  salaries and related costs  salaries and related costs increased 289 million due to 1 pay increases for pilot and nonpilot frontline employees 2 higher pension expense from a decline in the value of our defined benefit plan assets as a result of market conditions and 3 delta airline tickets awarded to employees as part of an employee recognition program these increases were partially offset by a 5 average decrease in headcount primarily related to workforce reduction programs 

  contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense decreased 844 million primarily due to decreases of 1 714 million associated with lower average fuel prices and 2 119 million from a 7 decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions 

  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased 784 million as a result of 1 641 million in impairment related charges recorded in the year ended december 31 2008 primarily related to certain definitelived intangible assets and aircraft and 2 125 million related to the december 2008 multiyear extension of our cobrand credit card relationship with american express the “american express agreement” extending the useful life of the american express agreement intangible asset to the date the contract expires 

  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 347 million primarily from capacity reductions 

  passenger commissions and other selling expenses passenger commissions and other selling expenses decreased 362 million primarily in connection with the passenger revenue decrease 

  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2008 we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions in addition the announcement of our intention to merge with northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of delta and northwest we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a noncash charge of 102 billion on a combined basis we also recorded a noncash charge of 955 million on a combined basis to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values 

  restructuring and mergerrelated items restructuring and mergerrelated items decreased 949 million primarily due to the following 

 

 

other expense income 

 

other expense net for 2009 was 13 billion compared to 12 billion for 2008 on a combined basis this change is primarily attributable to 1 a 200 million increase in interest expense from increased amortization of debt discount 2 a 151 million decrease in interest income primarily from significantly reduced shortterm interest rates 3 an 83 million noncash loss for the writeoff of the unamortized discount on the extinguishment of the northwest senior secured exit financing facility the “bank credit facility” and 4 a 421 million favorable change in miscellaneous net due to the following 

 

income taxes 

 

we consider all income sources including other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit that should be allocated to continuing operations for 2009 we recorded an income tax benefit of 344 million including a noncash income tax benefit of 321 million on the loss from continuing operations with an offsetting noncash income tax expense of 321 million on other comprehensive income we did not record an income tax benefit for the remainder of our loss for 2009 the deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss was fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 330 million for 2008 on a combined basis as a result of the impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets the impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes we did not record an income tax benefit as a result of our loss for 2008 the deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

results of operations—2008 gaap compared to 2007 predecessor plus successor 

in september 2005 we and substantially all of our subsidiaries the “delta debtors” filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code on april 30 2007 the “effective date” the delta debtors emerged from bankruptcy references in this form 10k to “successor” refer to delta on or after may 1 2007 after giving effect to 1 the cancellation of delta common stock issued prior to the effective date 2 the issuance of new delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the delta debtors’ joint plan of reorganization “delta’s plan of reorganization” and 3 the application of fresh start reporting references to “predecessor” refer to delta prior to may 1 2007 

we adopted fresh start reporting upon emergence from chapter 11 which resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes due to our adoption of fresh start reporting on april 30 2007 the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2007 include the results of operations for 1 the four months ended april 30 2007 of the predecessor and 2 the eight months ended december 31 2007 of the successor 

in this section we added the results of operations for the four months ended april 30 2007 of the predecessor with the eight months ended december 31 2007 of the successor we then compared 1 delta’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 under gaap with 2 the 2007 predecessor plus successor results we believe this presentation of the 2007 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing delta’s financial performance in 2008 and 2007 

operating revenue 

 

  northwest operations as a result of the merger our results of operations under gaap for 2008 include northwest’s operations for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 which increased our operating revenue by 20 billion in 2008 compared to the 2007 predecessor plus successor results the addition of northwest to our operations for that period increased asms or capacity 10 for the full year 

 

  mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue increased in 2008 compared to the 2007 predecessor plus successor results primarily due to 1 the inclusion of northwest’s operations 2 fare increases in response to increased fuel charges 3 pricing and scheduling initiatives and 4 our increased service to international destinations the increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 6 and 7 in passenger mile yield and prasm respectively 

 

  regional carriers  passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to the inclusion of northwest’s operations excluding northwest’s operations regional carriers revenue declined 58 million primarily due to an 8 decrease in capacity in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy as well as the termination of certain contract carrier agreements 

  cargo  cargo revenue increased due to the inclusion of northwest’s operations and an increase in fuel surcharges improved cargo yields and higher international volume 

  other net  other net revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of northwest’s operations excluding northwest’s operations other net revenue increased 485 million primarily due to 1 new or increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees 2 growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and 3 higher skymiles program revenue 

operating expense 

 

 

  northwest operations as a result of the merger our results of operations under gaap for 2008 include northwest’s operations for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 which increased operating expense by 21 billion in 2008 compared to the 2007 predecessor plus successor results the addition of northwest for that period increased capacity 10 for the full year 

  restructuring and mergerrelated items restructuring and mergerrelated items totaled a 11 billion charge primarily consisting of the following 

 

 

  impairments during 2008 we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions in addition the announcement of our intention to merge with northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of delta and northwest as a result we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a noncash charge of 69 billion we also recorded a noncash charge of 357 million to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values 

  fuel expense  fuel expense including contract carriers increased 22 billion primarily due to higher average fuel prices which were partially offset by fuel hedge gains and reduced consumption from lower capacity fuel prices averaged 318 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 134 million for 2008 compared to 224 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 51 million for 2007 

  salaries and related costs salaries and related costs increased 66 million primarily from a 6 average increase in pilots and flight attendants to staff increased international flying annual pay increases for all pilot and nonpilot nonmanagement employees and increases in group insurance rates partially offset by a 3 average decrease in headcount primarily related to two voluntary workforce reduction programs 

  aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 73 million primarily due to growth in our third party maintenance and repair business 

  passenger service passenger service increased 67 million primarily associated with 1 the increased cost of catering on international flights 2 product upgrades in our business elite cabins and 3 unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

  profit sharing in 2007 we recorded a 158 million charge related to our broadbased employee profit sharing plan we did not record any profit sharing expense in 2008 this plan provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined we will pay at least 15 of that profit to eligible employees 

other expense income 

other expense net for 2008 was 727 million compared to 492 million for 2007 this change is attributable to 1 a 53 million or 8 increase in interest expense primarily due to a higher level of debt outstanding including northwest debt for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 and the borrowing of the entire amount of our 10 billion exit revolving credit facility partially offset by the repayment of our debtorinpossession financing facilities the “dip facility” and other higher floating rate debt in connection with our emergence from chapter 11 2 a 36 million decrease in interest income primarily from lower cash balances prior to the merger and lower interest rates compared to 2007 and 3 a 146 million unfavorable change in miscellaneous net due to the following 

 

reorganization items net 

reorganization items net totaled a 12 billion gain for 2007 primarily consisting of the following 

 

income taxes 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 119 million for 2008 due to the impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets the impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes we did not record an income tax benefit as a result of our loss for 2008 the deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

for 2007 we recorded an income tax provision totaling 207 million we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets excluding the effect of the deferred tax liabilities that are unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the future under accounting guidance applicable in 2007 any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets was adjusted through goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying cost of these assets was zero accordingly during 2007 we reduced goodwill by 211 million with respect to the realization of preemergence deferred tax assets 

financial condition and liquidity 

we expect to meet our cash needs for 2010 from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 47 billion at december 31 2009 we also have 685 million of additional cash available from undrawn credit facilities as of december 31 2009 we have financing commitments from third parties or definitive agreements to sell all aircraft subject to purchase commitments except for nine previously owned md90 aircraft under these financing commitments third parties have agreed to finance on a longterm basis a substantial portion of the purchase price of the covered aircraft for additional information regarding our aircraft purchase commitments see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the global economic recession weakened demand for air travel decreasing our revenue and negatively impacting our liquidity in an effort to lessen the impact of the global recession we implemented initiatives to reduce costs increase revenues and preserve liquidity primarily through reducing capacity to align with demand workforce reduction programs and the acceleration of merger synergy benefits 

our ability to obtain additional financing if needed on acceptable terms could be affected by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens 

significant liquidity events 

significant liquidity events during 2009 were as follows 

 

for additional information regarding these matters and other liquidity events see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

sources and uses of cash 

in this section we review the sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 under gaap for 2007 we added delta’s sources and uses of cash for the four months ended april 30 2007 of the predecessor with the eight months ended december 31 2007 of the successor we believe the 2007 predecessor plus successor sources and uses of cash provides a more meaningful perspective on delta’s cash flows for 2007 than if we did not present this information in this manner 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 14 billion for 2009 primarily reflecting 1 the return from counterparties of 11 billion of hedge margin primarily used to settle hedge losses recognized during the period and 2 690 million in net income after adjusting for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization 

cash used in operating activities totaled 17 billion for 2008 primarily reflecting 1 an increase in aircraft fuel payments due to record high fuel prices for most of the year 2 the posting of 680 million in margin with counterparties primarily from our estimated fair value loss position on our fuel hedge contracts at december 31 2008 3 the payment of 438 million in premiums for fuel hedge derivatives entered into during 2008 4 a 374 million decrease in advance ticket sales due to the slowing economy and 5 the payment of 158 million in 2008 under our broadbased employee profit sharing plan related to 2007 cash used in operating activities was partially offset by cash flows driven by a 35 billion increase in operating revenue 20 billion of which is directly attributable to northwest’s operations since the closing date 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 14 billion for 2007 primarily reflecting 875 million in cash used under delta’s plan of reorganization to satisfy bankruptcyrelated obligations under our comprehensive agreement with alpa and settlement agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation cash flows from operating activities during 2007 also reflect 1 the release of 804 million from restricted cash pursuant to an amendment to our visamastercard credit card processing agreement 2 revenue and network productivity improvements including rightsizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes and 3 a 476 million decrease in shortterm investments primarily from sales of auction rate securities 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash used in investing activities totaled 10 billion for 2009 primarily reflecting net investments of 951 million for flight equipment and 251 million for ground property and equipment cash used in investing activities was partially offset by 1 a 142 million distribution of our investment in the reserve primary fund and 2 100 million of proceeds from the sale of flight equipment 

cash provided by investing activities totaled 16 billion for 2008 primarily reflecting 1 the inclusion of 24 billion in cash and cash equivalents from northwest in the merger and 2 609 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily related to 500 million of cash from a northwest borrowing that was released from escrow these inflows were partially offset by investments of 13 billion for flight equipment and 241 million for ground property and equipment 

cash used in investing activities totaled 625 million for 2007 primarily reflecting investments of 810 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and 226 million for ground property and equipment during 2007 restricted cash decreased by 185 million in addition we received 34 million and 83 million from the sale of our investments in pricelinecom incorporated and arinc incorporated respectively 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities totaled 19 million for 2009 primarily reflecting 30 billion in proceeds from longterm debt and aircraft financing largely associated with the issuance of 1 21 billion under three new financings as discussed above 2 342 million from the 20091 eetc offering with the remaining proceeds held in escrow and 3 150 million of tax exempt bonds mostly offset by the repayment of 29 billion in longterm debt and capital lease obligations including the bank credit facility and the revolving facility 

cash provided by financing activities totaled 17 billion for 2008 primarily reflecting 1 10 billion in borrowings under a revolving credit facility 2 10 billion received under the american express agreement for an advance purchase of skymiles and 3 10 billion from aircraft financing cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of 16 billion of longterm debt and capital lease obligations 

cash used in financing activities totaled 120 million for 2007 primarily reflecting 1 the repayment of the dip facility with a portion of the proceeds available under the senior secured exit financing facility and existing cash 2 the prepayment of 863 million of secured debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of enhanced equipment trust certificates and 3 scheduled principal payments on longterm debt and capital lease obligations during 2007 we also received 181 million in proceeds from an amendment to certain financing arrangements in which the outstanding principal amount was increased 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 the table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our contractual obligations 

 

 

 

  pension obligations we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for eligible nonpilot delta employees and retirees the “delta nonpilot plan” and defined benefit pension plans for eligible northwest employees and retirees the “northwest pension plans” all of which have been frozen for future benefit accruals our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act 

the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen under the alternative funding rules the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be funded over a fixed 17year period the unfunded liability is defined as the actuarial liability and is calculated using an 885 interest rate delta elected the alternative funding rules for the delta nonpilot plan effective april 1 2007 and northwest elected the alternative funding rules for the northwest pension plans effective october 1 2006 we estimate that the funding requirements under these plans will be approximately 720 million in 2010 

while this legislation makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements assumptions include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants 

the following items are not included in the table above 

  contract carrier agreements  during the year ended december 31 2009 six regional air carriers “contract carriers” operated for us in addition to our whollyowned subsidiaries comair compass airlines inc “compass” and mesaba aviation inc “mesaba” pursuant to capacity purchase agreements under these agreements the regional air carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight designator codes and we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services 

the above table shows our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase agreements excluding comair compass and mesaba the obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the contract carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as for fuel labor maintenance insurance catering property tax and landing fees accordingly our actual payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set forth in the table above 

for information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with chautauqua airlines inc and shuttle america corporation see “contingencies related to termination of contract carrier agreements” in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  uncertain tax positions the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 is 66 million we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service the “irs” for the 2008 and 2009 tax years 

  legal contingencies  we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices environmental issues bankruptcy matters antitrust matters and other matters concerning our business we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought 

  other contingent obligations under contracts  in addition to the contractual obligations discussed above we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment as defined by each respective contract if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs 

for additional information about other contingencies not discussed above as well as information related to general indemnifications see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

  frequent flyer programs we have a frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” offering incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on delta contract carriers and participating airlines as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we also sell mileage credits to other airlines and to nonairline businesses mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our sky club and for other program awards 

in the merger we assumed northwest’s frequent flyer program the “worldperks program” in october 2009 we completed the consolidation of the skymiles and worldperks programs which combined miles from each program at a onetoone ratio the worldperks program was accounted for under the same methodology as the skymiles program 

we use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits the fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines currently 00054 per mile and is reevaluated at least annually under the residual method the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits and the mileage component of passenger ticket sales that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted average price of all miles that have been deferred the portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold is recognized in income when the related marketing services are provided and classified as other net revenue 

for mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the estimate of breakage is based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years at december 31 2009 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 48 billion a hypothetical 1 change in our outstanding number of miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 33 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at december 31 2009 

  purchase accounting measurements on the closing date northwest revalued its assets and liabilities at fair value this revaluation did not impact earnings it did impact the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from northwest in the merger additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values as well as changes in other assumptions could significantly impact earnings 

the fair value of northwest’s debt and capital lease obligations was determined by estimating the present value of amounts to be paid at appropriate interest rates as of the closing date these rates were determined with swap rates libor rates and market spreads as of the closing date the market spreads which were determined with the assistance of third party financial institutions considered the credit risk and the structure of the debt and capital lease obligations as well as the underlying collateral supporting the obligations 

fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant unobservable inputs which generally include a fiveyear business plan 12 months of historical revenues and expenses by city pair projections of available seat miles revenue passenger miles load factors operating costs per available seat mile and a discount rate 

one of the significant unobservable inputs underlying the intangible fair value measurements performed on the closing date is the discount rate we determined the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry which was measured using a capital asset pricing model “capm” the capm in the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles utilized a 50 debt and 50 equity structure the historical average debttoequity structure of the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50 debt and 50 equity which was similar to northwest’s debttoequity structure at emergence from chapter 11 the return on debt was measured using a bidtoyield analysis of major airline corporate bonds the expected market rate of return for equity was measured based on the risk free rate the airline industry beta and risk premiums based on the federal reserve statistical release h 15 or ibbotson ® stocks bonds bills and inflation ® valuation yearbook edition 2008 these factors resulted in a 13 discount rate 

the fair value of northwest’s pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans’ funded status as of the closing date any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability one of the significant assumptions in determining our projected benefit obligation is the discount rate we determined the discount rate primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to estimated future benefit payments which resulted in a weighted average discount rate of 78 other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate retirement age and mortality assumptions 

  derivative instruments our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in an effort to manage our exposure to these risks we periodically enter into derivative instruments including fuel interest rate and foreign currency hedges these derivative instruments are comprised of contracts that are privately negotiated with counterparties without going through a public exchange accordingly our fair value assessments give consideration to the risk of counterparty default as well as our own credit risk 

 

 

 

we perform at least quarterly both a prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of our derivative instruments designated as hedges including assessing the possibility of counterparty default if we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedge in earnings as a result of our effectiveness assessment at december 31 2009 we believe our derivative instruments designated as hedges will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the hedged risk 

  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill reflects 1 the excess of the reorganization value of the successor over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities from the adoption of fresh start reporting adjusted for impairment and 2 the excess of purchase price over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from northwest in the merger the following table reflects the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2009 

 

during 2008 we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions in addition the announcement of our intention to merge with northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of delta and northwest see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we determined that these factors combined with further increases in fuel prices were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required as a result we estimated fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows supported with a marketbased valuation we determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a noncash charge of 69 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 in estimating fair value we based our estimates and assumptions on the same valuation techniques employed and levels of inputs used to estimate the fair value of goodwill upon adoption of fresh start reporting 

identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets 1 recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and 2 acquired in the merger indefinitelived assets are not amortized definitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts 

in addition to the goodwill impairment charge discussed above we recorded a noncash charge of 357 million 238 million after tax for the year ended december 31 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values 

we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis the annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is october 1 

in evaluating our goodwill for impairment we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering 1 our market capitalization 2 any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest 3 the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest 4 market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and 5 projected discounted future cash flows if reasonably estimable if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value no further testing is required if however the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value fair value is estimated based on 1 recent market transactions where available 2 the lease savings method for airport slots which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates 3 the royalty method for the delta tradename which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or 4 projected discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 

changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years factors which could cause impairment include but are not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 volatile fuel prices 3 declining passenger mile yields 4 lower passenger demand as a result of the weakened us and global economy 5 interruption to our operations due to an employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons 6 changes to the regulatory environment and 7 consolidation of competitors in the industry 

  longlived assets  our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 204 billion on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 this value is based on various factors including the assets’ estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if we decide to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations we will evaluate those assets for impairment for longlived assets held for sale we record impairment losses when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell we discontinue depreciation of longlived assets when these assets are classified as held for sale 

to determine impairments for aircraft used in operations we group assets at the fleettype level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity passenger mile yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors if impairment occurs the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available for additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of longlived assets see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  income tax valuation allowance and contingencies  we periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and we establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical earnings and losses our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and potential current and future tax planning strategies we cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets accordingly we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 

our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other taxing authorities although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest we review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations conclusion of tax audits a change in exposure based on current calculations identification of new issues release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue we would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

prior to january 1 2009 in the event that an adjustment to the income tax provision related to a preemergence tax position or northwest mergerrelated tax position we adjusted goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying value of those assets was zero beginning january 1 2009 any adjustments to the income tax provision in regard to preemergence tax positions are made through the income tax provision 

for additional information about income taxes see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  pension plans  we sponsor defined benefit pension plans “db plans” for our eligible employees and retirees we currently estimate that expense for our db plans in 2010 will be approximately 400 million the effect of our db plans on our consolidated financial statements is subject to many assumptions we believe the most critical assumptions are 1 the weighted average discount rate and 2 the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans 

we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate of 593 and 649 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively additionally our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 599 to 719 between 2007 and 2009 due to remeasurements throughout the year the impact of a 050 change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below 

the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans is based primarily on planspecific investment studies using historical market returns and volatility data with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts modest excess return expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually these assumptions are largely based on the asset category rateofreturn assumptions developed annually with our pension investment advisors however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for db plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds a 9 annualized return target the impact of a 050 change in our expected longterm rate of return is shown in the table below

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” the standard revises guidance on 1 the determination of when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting and 2 the allocation of transaction consideration among separately identified deliverables it also expands disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s multiple element revenue arrangements the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2009 the fasb issued “interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” the standard amends required disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual financial statements we adopted this standard on april 1 2009 

in december 2008 the fasb issued “employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets” it requires additional annual disclosures about assets held in an employer’s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan primarily related to categories and fair value measurements of plan assets we adopted this standard on january 1 2009 for additional information regarding this standard see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in march 2008 the fasb issued “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” the standard requires enhanced disclosures about 1 how and why an entity uses derivative instruments 2 how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and 3 how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows this standard is effective for interim and annual periods we adopted this standard on january 1 2009 

in december 2007 the fasb issued “business combinations revised 2007” the standard provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosure of information regarding the nature and financial effects of a business combination it also revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting under the original standard any reduction in the valuation allowance from the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero in contrast this revised standard requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income tax provision this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on january 1 2009 

supplemental information 

under gaap we do not include in our consolidated financial statements the results of northwest on or before the closing date accordingly our financial results under gaap for the year ended december 31 2008 include the results of northwest only for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 this impacts the comparability of our financial statements under gaap for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 financial results on a combined basis for the year ended december 31 2008 include the financial results for both delta and northwest beginning january 1 2008 we believe presenting the 2008 financial information on a combined basis provides useful information for comparing our financial performance in 2009 and 2008

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders’ equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices in an effort to manage our exposure to this risk we periodically enter into derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements including those of our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements 

as of january 31 2010 our open fuel hedge position for the year ending december 31 2010 is as follows 

 

for 2009 aircraft fuel and related taxes including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements accounted for 83 billion or 29 of our total operating expense including 14 billion of fuel hedge losses the following table shows the projected impact to aircraft fuel expense and fuel hedge margin for 2010 based on the impact of our open fuel hedge contracts at january 31 2010 assuming the following per barrel prices of crude oil 

 

 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates we had 96 billion of fixedrate longterm debt and 85 billion of variablerate longterm debt at december 31 2009 at december 31 2009 an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 297 million and increased interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 82 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenue and expense our largest exposures come from the japanese yen and canadian dollar in general a weakening yen or canadian dollar relative to the us dollar results in 1 our operating income being unfavorably impacted to the extent net yen or canadian dollardenominated revenues exceed expenses and 2 recognition of a nonoperating foreign currency gain due to the remeasurement of net yen or canadian dollardenominated liabilities to manage exchange rate risk we attempt to execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable we believe changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our results of operations

changes in internal control 

except as set forth below during the three months ended december 31 2009 we did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

on october 29 2008 a whollyowned subsidiary of ours merged with and into northwest on december 31 2009 nwa merged with and into delta ending nwa’s separate existence we are currently integrating policies processes people technology and operations for the combined company management will continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as we execute merger integration activities

 item 1 business tableend general description 

we are the world’s largest airline providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states and around the world on october 29 2008 a subsidiary of ours merged with and into northwest airlines corporation “northwest” as a result of this merger northwest and its subsidiaries including northwest airlines inc “nwa” became whollyowned subsidiaries of delta we plan to fully integrate the operations of nwa into delta as promptly as is feasible which we anticipate we will substantially complete in 2010 

the merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices invest in our fleet improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives we believe the merger will generate approximately 2 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization a more comprehensive and diversified route system and cost synergies from reduced overhead and improved operational efficiency we expect to incur onetime cash costs of approximately 500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines 

we have developed the following strategy that is intended to make delta the premier global airline 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware our principal executive offices are located at hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport in atlanta georgia the “atlanta airport” our telephone number is 404 7152600 and our internet address is wwwdeltacom information contained on this website is not part of and is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k 

airline operations 

our global route network is centered around the hub system we operate at airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city amsterdam and tokyonarita each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to domestic and international cities and to other hubs the combination of delta’s strengths in the south mountain west and northeast united states europe and latin america and nwa’s strengths in the 

  

index to financial statements midwest and northwest united states and asia gives the combined company a diversified global network with a presence in every major domestic and international market the network is supported by a fleet of aircraft that is varied in terms of size and capabilities giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network 

other key characteristics of our route network include 

 

  

  

  

 international alliances 

we have bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions common use of airport gates and ticket counters ticket office colocation and other marketing agreements these alliances often present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing 

our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under international codesharing arrangements we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our designator codes and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s designator code 

delta has international codeshare arrangements with aeromexico air france alitalia china airlines china southern csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air and royal air maroc and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with these airlines in addition to its transatlantic joint venture with klm discussed below nwa has international codeshare arrangements with air france korean air and malev hungarian airlines 

skyteam in addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines delta and nwa are members of the skyteam global airline alliance the other full members of skyteam are aeroflot aeromexico air france alitalia china southern continental csa czech airlines klm and korean air one goal of skyteam is to link the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations continental has provided written notice of the termination of its membership in skyteam effective october 24 2009 

in 2002 delta air france alitalia csa czech airlines and korean air received limited antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation “dot” that enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales marketing and discount programs for customers 

air france and klm joint ventures in addition to being members in skyteam with air france and klm both of which are subsidiaries of the same holding company delta has a transatlantic joint venture agreement 

  

index to financial statements with air france and nwa has a transatlantic joint venture agreement with klm these agreements provide for the sharing of revenues and costs on transatlantic routes as well as coordinated pricing scheduling and product development on included routes 

in 2007 delta entered into its joint venture agreement with air france to share decision making revenues and costs on transatlantic routes the initial implementation of the joint venture in april 2008 included flights operated by both carriers between air france’s parischarles de gaulle parisorly and lyon hubs and our atlanta cincinnati newyorkjfk and salt lake city hubs as well as all flights between london heathrow airport and the us with plans for the joint venture to be extended to all transatlantic flights operated by air france and delta between north america and europe and the mediterranean as well as all flights between los angeles and tahiti by 2010 

in 1992 nwa entered into its joint venture agreement with klm to share decision making revenues and costs on transatlantic routes pursuant to this joint venture nwa and klm operate an extensive transatlantic network including operating joint service between amsterdam and cities in the us canada and mexico as well as between amsterdam and india 

delta nwa air france and klm are currently negotiating the terms for implementing a combined transatlantic joint venture which is expected to be implemented no later than november 2009 and would replace the separate joint ventures described above 

in may 2008 we nwa air france alitalia csa czech airlines and klm received limited antitrust immunity from the dot that enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales marketing and discount programs for customers the dot conditioned the continued effectiveness of this antitrust immunity on the implementation within 18 months of a joint venture agreement among us nwa air france and klm a more integrated joint venture would offer significant advantages to consumers including more choice in flight schedules travel times services and fares in light of the recent reorganization of alitalia and its subsidiaries under a new structure with cai compagnia aerea italiana spa delta and nwa have suspended immunized activities with alitalia but not codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges or other alliance marketing activities while we seek to transfer the abovedescribed antitrust immunity to the new alitalia 

domestic alliances 

we and nwa have entered into marketing alliances with 1 continental including regional carriers affiliated with continental and 2 alaska and horizon each of which includes mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements delta also has frequent flyer and reciprocal lounge agreements with hawaiian airlines and a codesharing agreement with american eagle airlines “american eagle” nwa also has frequent flyer and codesharing agreements with several other airlines including american eagle gulfstream international airlines hawaiian and midwest airlines these marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks continental has provided written notice to delta and nwa of the termination of its participation in marketing alliances with delta and nwa effective july 31 2009 and april 14 2009 respectively we plan to wind down the relationships with continental in an orderly manner and do not expect the termination of the alliances to have any significant impact 

regional carriers 

delta and nwa have air service agreements with multiple domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities these arrangements enable us to increase the number of flights we have available in certain locations to better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets approximately 23 of our passenger revenue in 2008 related to flying by regional air carriers 

  

index to financial statements through our regional carrier program we have contractual arrangements with ten regional carriers to operate regional jet and in certain cases turboprop aircraft using our “dl” and “nw” designator codes in addition to our whollyowned subsidiaries comair compass and mesaba we have contractual arrangements with atlantic southeast airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest inc “skywest” skywest airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest chautauqua airlines inc a subsidiary of republic airways holdings inc “republic holdings” shuttle america corporation a subsidiary of republic holdings freedom airlines inc a subsidiary of mesa air group inc pinnacle airlines inc and american eagle 

with the exception of eagle and a portion of skywest airlines as described below these agreements are capacity purchase arrangements under which delta and nwa control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carrier’s flights operating under our “dl” and “nw” designator codes and we are entitled to all ticket cargo and mail revenues associated with these flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least ten years which grant us the option to extend the initial term and provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates our arrangements with eagle limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of the flights operated for us by skywest airlines are structured as revenue proration agreements these proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

frequent flyer programs 

delta and nwa both have frequent flyer programs which are designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on each airline we are in the process of integrating these programs with a goal of combining the programs by the beginning of 2010 

delta’s skymiles ® program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta’s regional carriers and other participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies telecommunication services and internet services in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months’ advance notice and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice 

skymiles mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our crown room club and for other program participant awards travel awards are subject to certain transfer restrictions and capacitycontrolled seating in some cases blackout dates may apply program accounts with no activity for 12 consecutive months after enrollment are deleted miles will not expire so long as at least once every two years the participant 1 takes a qualifying flight on delta or a delta connection carrier 2 earns miles through one of our program participants 3 buys miles from delta or 4 redeems miles for any program award

delta cargo is the largest cargo carrier among the us passenger airlines based on revenue through the strength of our global network we are able to connect all of the world’s major freight gateways we generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets primarily through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft additionally we have a limited focused network of freighters that tie together the key freight markets in asia and connect to three gateways in the us 

delta cargo is a member of skyteam cargo the world’s largest global airline cargo alliance the alliance whose other members are aeromexico cargo air france cargo alitalia cargo csa czech airlines cargo klm cargo and korean air cargo offers a global network with over 16000 daily flights spanning 6 continents this alliance offers cargo customers a consistent international product line and the partners work to jointly improve their efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace 

mro 

our maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” operations known as delta techops is the largest airline mro in north america with stateoftheart facilities worldwide in addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for the combined delta and nwa fleets of nearly 800 aircraft delta techops serves more than 125 aviation and airline customers from around the world delta techops employs approximately 8500 maintenance professionals and is one of the most experienced mro providers in the world 

among the key services we offer are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2006 through 2008 

 

  

    our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

we use derivative instruments which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices 

  

index to financial statements we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

competition 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city amsterdam and tokyonarita either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators our ability to compete effectively depends in significant part on our ability to maintain a cost structure that is competitive with other carriers 

in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes and in international markets international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines and others and which continental has announced its intention to join in october 2009 and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies treaty with the member states of the european union has accelerated this trend through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international route awards are also subject to the approval of the president of the us for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

  

index to financial statements airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in most domestic and international city pairs without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time 

certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan in washington dc laguardia and jfk in new york and newark our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities similarly our operations at tokyo’s narita airport london’s gatwick and heathrow airports and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport association’s worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that 

  

index to financial statements local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with the existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date icao has adopted additional aircraft engine emissions standards applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 but the epa has not yet proposed a rule that incorporates these new icao standards 

concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad we may become subject to taxes charges or additional requirements to obtain permits for greenhouse gas emissions in july 2008 the european union approved legislation to include aviation in their emissions trading system “ets” beginning in 2012 any airline with flights originating or landing in the european union will be subject to the ets and will be required to buy a permit for its greenhouse gas emissions we expect that such a system will impose significant costs on our operations in the european union similar cap and trade restrictions are being proposed in the united states in the event that us legislation or regulation is enacted or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in other jurisdictions where we operate or where we may operate in the future it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry at this time we cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulation would apportion costs between one or more jurisdictions in which we operate flights which could result in multiple taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions certain credits may be available to reduce the costs of permits in order to mitigate the impact of such regulations on consumers at this time we cannot predict whether we or the aviation industry in general will have access to offsets or credits we are carefully monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments 

we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site and liability at many of these sites has been resolved through our chapter 11 proceedings we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and drinking water 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international range aircraft from october 1 2008 until september 30 2009 as of october 1 2008 the following numbers of our international range aircraft are available for craf activation 

 

   

index to financial statements the craf program has only been activated twice both times at the stage i level since it was created in 1951 

regulatory and legislative proposals 

concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the dot and faa to consider various proposals for access to certain airports including “congestionbased” landing fees and programs that would withdraw slots from existing carriers and reallocate those slots either by lottery to carriers with little or no current presence at such airports or by auction to the highest bidder these proposals if enacted could negatively impact our existing services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class under the nmb’s usual rules a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of those employees vote for union representation a certified labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the president of the us appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

  

index to financial statements collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2008 we had a total of 84306 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 42 of these employees were represented by unions including the following domestic employee groups 

 

  labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees including at our airline subsidiaries that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes 

the successful integration of nwa into delta and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the merger depend significantly on integrating delta’s and nwa’s employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations the integration of delta and nwa workforces will be challenging in part because approximately 80 of the premerger northwest employees are represented by labor unions while among us based premerger delta employees only the delta pilots and flight dispatchers who combined constitute approximately 17 of the total premerger delta employees are represented by labor unions completing the integration of the workforces of the two airlines will require the resolution of potentially difficult issues relating to representation of various work groups and the relative seniority of the work groups at each carrier unexpected delay expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces could impact the expected synergies from the combination of delta and nwa and affect our financial performance 

under procedures that have been utilized by the nmb each labor union that currently represents usbased employees at delta or nwa as well as other groups of employees with a sufficient showing of interest will have an opportunity to invoke the nmb’s jurisdiction to address representation issues arising from the merger once its jurisdiction is invoked the nmb’s rules call for it to first determine whether delta and nwa have combined or will combine to form a single carrier on january 7 2009 the nmb ruled that delta and nwa now constitute a single transportation system for representation purposes under the railway labor act 

  

index to financial statements the nmb has utilized certain procedures to address and resolve representation issues arising from airline mergers which generally have included the following 

 

  

  

 in view of these procedures we believe that a representation election may occur in one or more combined employee groups under the nmb’s rules a labor union generally will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of those employees vote for union representation if a labor union is certified to represent a combined group the terms and conditions of employment of the combined work group ultimately will be subject to negotiations toward a joint collective bargaining agreement completing joint collective bargaining agreements covering combined work groups that choose to be represented by a labor union could take significant time which could delay or impede our ability to achieve targeted synergies from the merger 

with respect to integration of seniority lists where the two employee groups in a craft or class have different representation status federal law requires that seniority integration be governed by the procedures first issued by the civil aeronautics board in the alleghenymohawk merger – known as the alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions in general alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions require that seniority be integrated in a “fair and equitable” manner and that any disputes not resolved by negotiations may be submitted to binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator this requirement is consistent with the seniority protection policy that has been adopted by the delta board of directors where both groups are represented by the same union prior to the merger seniority integration is governed by the union’s bylaws and policies the integration of the seniority lists of the pilots of delta and nwa as well as flight dispatchers meteorologists and technicians and related technical operations employees have been resolved

 item 1a risk factors tableend risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel high fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results likewise significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially in the last five years and spiked at record high levels in 2008 before falling dramatically during the latter part of the year in 2008 our average fuel price per gallon rose 41 to 316 as compared to an average price of 224 in 2007 which was 6 higher than our average price of 212 in 2006 and significantly higher than fuel prices in the earlier part of this decade the fuel costs represented 38 31 and 30 of our operating expense in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively total operating expense for 2008 reflects a 73 billion noncash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and 11 billion in primarily noncash mergerrelated charges including these charges fuel costs accounted for 28 of total operating expense these increasing costs have had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited by the competitive nature of the airline industry we often have not been able to increase our fares to offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future 

in addition our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices we use derivative instruments which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure depending on the type of hedging instrument used our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be limited 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us 

the global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel and may create challenges for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as the effects of the global economic recession have been felt in our domestic and international markets we are experiencing weaker demand for air travel our demand began to slow during the december 2008 quarter and we believe worsening global economic conditions in 2009 will substantially reduce us airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result we have announced plans to further reduce our consolidated capacity by 68 in 2009 compared to 2008 which reflects planned domestic capacity reductions of 810 and international capacity reductions of 35 and have offered voluntary workforce reduction programs for eligible employees demand for air travel could continue to fall if the global economic recession continues and overall demand may fall much lower than we are able prudently to reduce capacity the weakness in the united states and international economies could have a significant negative impact on our future results of operations 

the global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 

the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have an impact on our business and our financial condition for example our ability to access the capital markets 

  

index to financial statements may be severely restricted at a time when we would like or need to do so which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the credit crisis could have an impact on our remaining fuel hedging contracts or our interest hedging contracts if counterparties are forced to file for bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to perform their obligations 

the financial crisis and economic downturn have also resulted in broadly lower investment asset returns and values including in the defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor for eligible employees and retirees our funding obligations for these plans which have been frozen for future benefit accruals are governed by the employee retirement income security act “erisa” estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control including among other things the market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition due primarily to the recent decline in the investment markets we currently expect our contributions to these plans to significantly increase for 2010 and thereafter which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the financial crisis also resulted in us being unable to access 139 million invested with the reserve primary fund as of february 28 2009 the reserve primary fund is a money market fund that has suspended redemptions and is being liquidated we had invested approximately 11 billion in this fund have received distributions of 925 million and have recorded a 13 million loss to the cost basis of our pro rata share of the estimated loss in the fund while we expect to receive substantially all of our current holdings in this fund we cannot predict when this will occur or the amount we will receive 

our obligation to post collateral in connection with our fuel hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our shortterm liquidity 

under fuel hedge contracts that we may enter into from time to time counterparties to those contracts may require us to fund the margin associated with any loss position on the contracts at december 31 2008 our counterparties required us to fund 12 billion of fuel hedge margin if fuel prices continue to fall we may be required to post a significant amount of additional collateral which could have an impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments until those contracts are settled 

our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 

we have substantial indebtedness which could 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition a substantial level of indebtedness particularly because substantially all of our assets are currently subject to liens could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business these liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions industry trends performance and many other factors not within our control 

  

index to financial statements certain of our credit facilities include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

the exit facility financing credit agreements of delta and nwa and the liquidity facility credit agreement of nwa each contain financial covenants that require delta or nwa respectively to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio minimum unrestricted cash reserves and minimum collateral coverage ratios in addition each of the credit facilities contains other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants may have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition if we fail to comply with the covenants in any credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result under that facility 

each of the credit facilities also contains other events of default customary for such financings if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding borrowings under the respective credit facilities immediately due and payable and our cash may become restricted we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance borrowings under any of the credit facilities if such borrowings were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other financing agreements of delta and nwa 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants and other personnel approximately 42 of our workforce is unionized strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business relations between air carriers and labor unions in the us are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted 

in addition if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

the ability to realize fully the anticipated benefits of our merger with northwest may depend on the successful integration of the businesses of delta and northwest 

our merger with northwest involves the combination of two companies which operated as independent public companies prior to the merger the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees diversion of each company’s management’s attention the disruption or interruption of or the loss of momentum in our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely effect our business and financial results 

the integration of the delta and nwa workforces will present significant challenges including the possibility of laborrelated disagreements that may adversely affect our operations 

the successful integration of delta and northwest and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combination depend significantly on integrating delta’s and nwa’s employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations the integration of delta and nwa workforces will be challenging in part because 

  

index to financial statements approximately 80 of the nwa employees are represented by labor unions while among us based employees only the premerger delta pilots and flight dispatchers who combined constitute approximately 17 of the total premerger delta employees are currently represented by labor unions the integration of the workforces of the two airlines will require the resolution of potentially difficult issues relating to representation of various work groups and the relative seniority of the work groups at each carrier unexpected delay expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces could impact the expected synergies from the combination of delta and northwest and affect the financial performance of the combined company 

interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city amsterdam and tokyonarita each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at the atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver these expected benefits if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected in addition we may face challenges associated with integrating complex systems and technologies that support the separate operations of delta and nwa if we are unable to manage these challenges effectively our business and results of operation could be negatively affected 

in addition any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs like all companies our technology systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business 

if we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances the initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

we sell a substantial number of tickets that are paid for by customers who use credit cards our credit card processing agreements provide that no future holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain 

  

index to financial statements circumstances including in which we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash if circumstances were to occur that would allow either processor to initiate a holdback the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be significant 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability the insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate in the event that the insurance is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation and may be further limited as a result of the merger with northwest and the employee equity issuance together with other equity transactions 

in general under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses “nols” to offset future taxable income in general an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period generally three years 

as of december 31 2008 delta reported approximately 92 billion of federal and state nol carryforwards as of december 31 2008 northwest reported approximately 53 billion of federal and state nol carryforwards both delta and northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code pursuant to the merger agreement delta and northwest elected out of section 382l5 of the code in which case section 382l6 of the code will be applicable to the ownership changes that occurred pursuant to our respective plans of reorganization as a result of the merger northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change delta also may experience a subsequent ownership change as a result of the merger and the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger together with other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period even if the merger and the employee equity issuance did not result in an ownership change the merger and the employee equity issuance has significantly increased the likelihood there will be a subsequent ownership change for delta as a result of transactions involving sale of our common stock 

the northwest ownership change resulting from the merger and the potential occurrence of a second ownership change for delta could limit the ability to utilize prechange nols that are not currently subject to limitation and could further limit the ability to utilize nols that are currently subject to limitation the amount of the annual limitation generally is equal to the value of the stock of the corporation immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the adjusted federal taxexempt rate set by the internal revenue service limitations imposed on the ability to use nols to offset future taxable income could cause us federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such nols to expire unused in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes 

transfer restrictions on our stock issued in connection with our plan of reorganization may limit the liquidity of our stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers our certificate of incorporation contains certain restrictions on the transfer of our stock these transfer restrictions will be effective until may 1 2009 subject to extension for an additional three years these transfer restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our stock to dispose of or acquire shares of our stock during the period the restrictions are in place furthermore while the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an “ownership change” from occurring within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur 

  

index to financial statements risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta cincinnati detroit memphis minneapolisst paul new yorkjfk salt lake city amsterdam and tokyonarita either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from regional jet operators 

lowcost carriers including southwest airtran and jetblue in the us have placed significant competitive pressure on us and other network carriers in the domestic market in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in light of increased jet fuel costs and other issues in recent years we expect consolidation to occur in the airline industry as a result of consolidation we may face significant competition from larger carriers that may be able to generate higher amounts of revenue and compete more efficiently 

in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines and others and which continental has announced its intention to join in october 2009 and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies agreement with the member states of the european union has accelerated this trend through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which resulted in industrywide liquidity issues additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry would negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the us 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues for example the aviation and 

  

index to financial statements transportation security act which became law in november 2001 mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax the proposed ticket tax increase if implemented could negatively impact our revenues 

proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast us have included concepts such as “congestionbased” landing fees “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines furthermore events related to extreme weather delays in late 2006 and early 2007 have caused congress and the dot to consider proposals related to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions the enactment of such proposals could have a significant negative impact on our operations in addition some states have also enacted or considered enacting such regulations 

future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission is seeking to impose an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the us laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the coverage currently extends through march 31 2009 and the secretary of transportation has discretion to extend coverage through may 31 2009 the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially if available such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all resulting in an interruption to our operations

 ground facilities 

we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy delta’s largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of its principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases delta owns a portion of its principal offices its atlanta reservations center and other real property in atlanta nwa owns its primary offices which are located near the minneapolisst paul international airport including its corporate offices located on a 160acre site east of the airport other nwa owned facilities include reservations centers in baltimore maryland tampa florida minot north dakota and chisholm minnesota and a data processing center in eagan minnesota nwa also owns property in tokyo including a 13acre site in downtown tokyo and a 33acre land parcel 512room hotel and flight kitchen located near tokyo’s narita international airport 

we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve at most airports we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other improvements and facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft these leases and use agreements generally run for 

  

index to financial statements periods of less than one year to 30 years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement examples of major leases and use agreements at hub or other significant airports that will expire in the next several years include among others 1 our atlanta airport central passenger terminal lease and the airport use agreement which expire in 2010 2 our salt lake city international airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2010 and 3 nwa’s memphis international airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2009 we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports including among others 1 our main atlanta maintenance base 2 our atlanta air cargo facilities and our hangar and air cargo facilities at the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport and salt lake city international airport and 3 nwa hangar and air cargo facilities at the detroit metropolitan international airport minneapolisst paul international airport and seattletacoma international airport our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities including in some cases amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction we also lease marketing ticketing and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms 

in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

the city of atlanta is currently implementing portions of a ten year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport implementation of the cip should increase the number of flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays the cip includes among other things a 9000 foot fullservice runway that opened in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements if fully implemented the cip is currently estimated by the city of atlanta to cost approximately 68 billion which exceeds the 54 billion cip approved by the airlines in 1999 the cip will not be complete until at least 2012 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds certain elements of the cip have been delayed some may be eliminated and there is no assurance that the cip will be fully implemented failure to implement certain portions of the cip in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at the atlanta airport

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend general information 

on october 29 2008 the “closing date” we completed our merger the “merger” with northwest creating the world’s largest airline we now offer service to 378 worldwide destinations in 66 countries and expect to serve more than 170 million passengers each year combined with the reach of skyteam our global airline alliance and our codeshare partners our customers can fly to 570 destinations in 111 countries the merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile oil prices invest in our fleet improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives 

year in review 

for 2008 we reported a consolidated net loss of 89 billion which reflects 1 a 73 billion noncash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 2 11 billion in primarily noncash mergerrelated charges 3 significantly increased fuel costs and 4 weakened demand due to the onset of a global recession 

during 2008 fuel prices fluctuated dramatically fuel is one of our most significant costs at the beginning of the year crude oil prices hovered around 100 per barrel escalating to 145 per barrel by midsummer we were not able to increase revenues through ticket prices fuel surcharges or other passenger service fees to cover all of our higher fuel costs accordingly we reduced capacity by 5 in the second half of the year compared to our 2008 plan as part of this capacity reduction we removed 31 aircraft from our operating fleet of which 22 have been sold or returned to the lessors and nine remain temporarily grounded or held for sale we also offered voluntary workforce reduction programs to our us based nonpilot employees during the year these programs helped us rightsize our workforce to the capacity reductions approximately 4200 employees or 8 of our premerger workforce elected to participate in these programs 

throughout the summer months fuel prices remained at record high levels and were forecasted to continue to rise based on this outlook we added fuel hedges to protect against further escalating fuel costs however fuel prices fell dramatically during the third and fourth quarters creating sizable losses on our fuel hedge contracts in the fourth quarter losses on our derivative contracts that relate to jet fuel purchases in 2009 are deferred on our consolidated balance sheet for 2008 and will be recognized in 2009 when the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed 

northwest merger 

we believe the merger will generate approximately 2 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization a more comprehensive and diversified route system and cost synergies from reduced overhead and improved operational efficiency we expect to realize the following benefits from integrating the operations of delta and northwest 

 

  

  

   

index to financial statements in connection with the closing of the merger we awarded to substantially all us based delta and northwest employees an aggregate of 101 million shares of common stock this award recognizes the critical role of our employees in assisting us achieve our financial operational and customer service goals as a result of this award we recorded 791 million in onetime primarily noncash charges to restructuring and mergerrelated items 

we expect to incur onetime cash costs of approximately 500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines we plan to integrate the operations of northwest into delta as promptly as is feasible which we anticipate we will substantially complete in 2010 

outlook 

we believe a combination of lower fuel prices capacity reductions and merger synergies better positions us to effectively manage our business through the current economic crisis nevertheless we expect to report a significant loss in the march 2009 quarter primarily due to fuel hedge losses coupled with the impact of the global recession which has weakened demand for air travel and the first quarter traditionally being our weakest quarter due to seasonality 

fuel prices and other costs 

in 2009 we expect to use approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel at that level of consumption a 1 change in the average annual per barrel price of crude oil can impact our financial results by approximately 100 million accordingly the volatility of fuel prices will continue to have a major impact on our financial results 

as discussed above at current market prices we will recognize losses on hedge contracts that we entered into in 2008 when fuel prices were much higher the majority of these losses will be recognized in the first half of 2009 as the hedged fuel is purchased and consumed in january 2009 we have added new hedges that reflect current market prices approximating 16 of our estimated 2009 consumption should fuel prices remain at their current levels we will realize significant savings in fuel costs compared to 2008 

we expect higher pension expense in 2009 compared to 2008 from a decline in the value of our defined benefit plan assets driven by market conditions and increases in certain other operating expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 due to timing delays between the reduction in capacity and our ability to remove certain capacityrelated costs we also expect to record approximately 260 million of higher interest expense related to increased amortization of debt discount reflecting lower fair value of northwest debt as of the closing date 

demand and capacity 

the global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel our demand began to slow during the december 2008 quarter and we believe worsening global economic conditions in 2009 will substantially reduce us airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result we have announced plans to further reduce capacity by 68 in 2009 compared to 2008 which reflect planned reductions in domestic capacity of 810 and international capacity of 35 if economic conditions continue to worsen we expect to make additional reductions to our capacity we believe we have flexibility in our network and fleet to remove additional capacity if the environment warrants 

in december 2008 we announced additional voluntary workforce reduction programs for us based nonpilot employees to align staffing with the planned capacity reductions approximately 2100 employees elected to participate we expect to record between 40 million and 50 million in restructuring charges during the march 2009 quarter for these programs 

  

index to financial statements merger synergies 

as discussed above we expect to generate significant synergies from the merger our key early integration efforts will focus on 1 technology 2 employees 3 standardizing our fleet across the two airlines and 4 achieving a single operating certificate 

we believe that we will recognize 500 million in synergy benefits in 2009 primarily in the second half of the year our ability to realize the synergies will depend among other things on our successfully aligning technologies of the two airlines receiving a single operating certificate and resolving labor representation differences while maintaining productive employee relations 

we have made significant progress regarding integration of our workgroups including reaching joint collective bargaining agreements and integrated seniority lists with our pilots and flight dispatchers and reaching agreement on a seniority list with our meteorologists recently the nmb accepted a request by the aircraft mechanics fraternal association “amfa” to terminate amfa’s certification to represent premerger nwa aircraft maintenance technicians and related employees which will allow us to integrate these workgroups promptly in addition the delta flight attendant seniority committee has reached a position on a combined seniority list that we believe is consistent with the position of the association of flight attendants “afa” which was certified to represent the nwa flight attendants prior to the merger the integration of some portions of the rest of the delta and nwa workforces may be challenging in part because representation and seniority integration issues must be resolved and two of the unions the afa and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers which represents nwa’s airport employees and other categories of ground employees have not said when they will seek to proceed to resolve those issues 

background and combined financial results of the predecessor and successor 

in september 2005 we and substantially all of our subsidiaries the “delta debtors” filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the “bankruptcy code” on april 30 2007 the “effective date” the delta debtors emerged from bankruptcy references in this form 10k to “successor” refer to delta on or after may 1 2007 after giving effect to 1 the cancellation of delta common stock issued prior to the effective date 2 the issuance of new delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the delta debtors’ joint plan of reorganization “delta’s plan of reorganization” and 3 the application of fresh start reporting references to “predecessor” refer to delta prior to may 1 2007 

upon emergence from chapter 11 we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position 907 “financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code” “sop 907” the adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes due to our adoption of fresh start reporting on april 30 2007 the accompanying consolidated statements of operations include the results of operations for 1 the year ended december 31 2008 of the successor 2 the eight months ended december 31 2007 of the successor 3 the four months ended april 30 2007 of the predecessor and 4 the year ended december 31 2006 of the predecessor 

for purposes of management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations in this form 10k we combined the results of operations for the four months ended april 30 2007 of the predecessor with the eight months ended december 31 2007 of the successor we then compare 1 delta’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 with the 2007 combined results and 2 the 2007 combined results with the predecessor’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 we also discuss significant fresh start reporting adjustments “fresh start adjustments” which impacted comparability 

we believe the 2007 combined results of operations provide management and investors with a more meaningful perspective on delta’s financial and operational performance than if we did not combine the results of operations of the predecessor and the successor in this manner similarly we combine the financial results of the predecessor and the successor when discussing our sources and uses of cash for the year ended december 31 2007

operating revenue 

 

 northwest operations as a result of the merger our results of operations for 2008 include northwest’s operations for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 increasing our operating revenue 20 billion the addition of northwest to our operations for that period increased available seat miles “asms” or capacity 10 for the full year 

 

 mainline passenger revenue mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to 1 the inclusion of northwest’s operations 2 fare increases in response to increased fuel charges 3 pricing and scheduling initiatives and 4 our increased service to international destinations the increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 6 and 7 in passenger mile yield and passenger revenue per available seat mile “prasm” respectively 

 

  

   

index to financial statements regional carriers  passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to the inclusion of northwest’s operations excluding northwest’s operations regional carriers revenue declined 58 million primarily due to an 8 decrease in capacity in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy as well as the termination of certain contract carrier agreements 

cargo  cargo revenue increased due to the inclusion of northwest’s operations and an increase in fuel surcharges improved yields and higher international volume 

other net  other net revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of northwest’s operations excluding northwest’s operations other net revenue increased 485 million primarily due to 1 new or increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees 2 growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and 3 higher skymiles program revenue 

operating expense 

 

  

   

index to financial statements northwest operations as a result of the merger 2008 includes northwest’s operations for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 increasing operating expense 21 billion the addition of northwest for that period increased capacity 10 for the full year 

restructuring and mergerrelated items restructuring and mergerrelated items totaled a 11 billion charge primarily consisting of the following 

 

  

  

  

 impairments during the march 2008 quarter we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization driven primarily by record fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions in addition the announcement of our intention to merge with northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of delta and northwest as a result of these indicators we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a noncash charge of 69 billion in addition to the goodwill impairment charge in the june 2008 quarter we recorded a noncash charge of 357 million to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values 

fuel expense  fuel expense including contract carriers increased 22 billion primarily due to higher average fuel prices partially offset by fuel hedge gains and reduced consumption from lower capacity fuel prices averaged 318 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 134 million for 2008 compared to 224 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 51 million for 2007 

salaries and related costs a 109 million increase primarily from a 6 average increase in pilots and flight attendants to staff increased international flying annual pay increases for all pilot and nonpilot nonmanagement employees and increases in group insurance rates partially offset by a 3 average decrease in headcount primarily related to two voluntary workforce reduction programs 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs a 73 million increase primarily due to growth in our third party maintenance and repair business 

passenger service a 67 million increase primarily associated with 1 the increased cost of catering on international flights 2 product upgrades in our business elite cabins and 3 unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

profit sharing a 158 million charge related to our broadbased employee profit sharing plan in 2007 we did not record any profit sharing expense in 2008 this plan provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined we will pay at least 15 of that profit to eligible employees 

operating income and operating margin 

we reported an operating loss of 83 billion for 2008 and operating income of 11 billion for 2007 operating margin which is the ratio of operating loss income to operating revenues was 37 and 6 for 2008 and 2007 respectively

other expense net for 2008 was 727 million compared to 492 million for 2007 this change is attributable to 1 a 53 million or 8 increase in interest expense primarily due to a higher level of debt outstanding including northwest debt for the period from october 30 to december 31 2008 and the borrowing of the entire amount of our 10 billion revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” partially offset by the repayment of our debtorinpossession financing facilities the “dip facility” and other higher floating rate debt in connection with our emergence from chapter 11 2 a 36 million decrease in interest income primarily from lower cash balances prior to the merger and lower interest rates compared to 2007 and 3 a 146 million increase to miscellaneous net due to the following 

 

 reorganization items net 

reorganization items net totaled a 12 billion gain for 2007 primarily consisting of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements  income tax benefit provision 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 119 million for 2008 as a result of the impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets the impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes we did not record an income tax benefit for the remainder of our loss for 2008 as it is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 

for 2007 we recorded an income tax provision totaling 207 million we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets excluding the effect of the deferred tax liabilities that are unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the future we will continue to assess the need for a full valuation allowance in future periods in accordance with sop 907 any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying cost of these assets is zero accordingly during 2007 we reduced goodwill by 211 million with respect to the realization of preemergence deferred tax assets 

results of operations—2007 combined compared to 2006 

fresh start adjustments 

during the eight months ended december 31 2007 fresh start adjustments resulted in a 157 million increase to pretax income for the year ended december 31 2007 the fresh start adjustments consist of the following 

 

 skymiles frequent flyer program  we revalued our frequent flyer award liability to estimated fair value and changed our accounting policy from an incremental cost method to a deferred revenue method fair value represents the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation of redeeming miles under the skymiles program fresh start adjustments for the skymiles program including the change in accounting policy for that program increased operating revenue by 188 million 

  

index to financial statements fuel hedging  prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting on april 30 2007 we recorded as a component of stockholders’ deficit in other comprehensive loss 46 million of deferred gains related to our fuel hedging program this gain would have been recognized as an offset to fuel expense as the underlying fuel hedge contracts were settled however as required by fresh start reporting accumulated other comprehensive loss prior to emergence from chapter 11 was reset to zero accordingly fresh start adjustments resulted in a noncash increase to fuel expense of 46 million 

depreciation  we revalued property and equipment to fair value which reduced the net book value of these assets by 10 billion in addition we adjusted the depreciable lives of flight equipment to reflect revised estimated useful lives as a result depreciation expense decreased by 127 million 

amortization of intangible assets  we valued our intangible assets at fair value which increased the net book value of intangible assets excluding goodwill by 29 billion of which 956 million relates to amortizable intangible assets as a result amortization expense increased by 146 million 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs  we changed the way we account for certain maintenance parts that were previously capitalized and depreciated after emergence we expense these parts as they are placed on the aircraft this change resulted in an increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense of 52 million 

interest expense  the revaluation of our debt and capital lease obligations resulted in a decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of premiums from adjusting these obligations to fair value during 2007 33 million in future premium credits were accelerated in connection with accounting for 1 an amendment to certain financing arrangements and 2 the prepayment of certain secured debt as a result interest expense decreased by 70 million 

other fresh start adjustments  we recorded other fresh start adjustments relating primarily to the revaluation of our aircraft leases these adjustments increased operating expense by 19 million and nonoperating expense by 3 million 

accounting adjustments 

during 2006 we recorded certain outofperiod adjustments “accounting adjustments” in our consolidated financial statements that affect the comparability of our results for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 these adjustments resulted in a net noncash charge approximating 310 million to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 consisting of 

 

  

  

 we believe the accounting adjustments considered individually and in the aggregate are not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 in making this assessment we 

  

index to financial statements considered qualitative and quantitative factors including our substantial net loss in that year the noncash nature of the accounting adjustments our substantial stockholders’ deficit at december 31 2006 and our status as a debtorinpossession under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code during that year 

operating revenue 

 

 operating revenue totaled 192 billion for 2007 a 16 billion or 9 increase compared to 2006 passenger revenue increased 9 on a 3 increase in asms or capacity and a 19 point increase in load factor the increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 4 and 7 in passenger mile yield and prasm respectively mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to 1 strong passenger demand 2 our increased service to international destinations 3 increased skymiles revenue associated with fresh start adjustments discussed above and 4 the negative impact of accounting adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased primarily due to increased flying by our contract carriers which resulted in an 8 increase in revenue passenger miles “rpms” or traffic on 7 greater capacity other net revenue increased primarily due to 1 increased skymiles revenue due to a change in accounting methodology and fresh start adjustments discussed above 2 increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees 3 growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and 4 the negative impact of accounting adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above 

 

 north american passenger revenue  north american passenger revenue increased 3 driven by a 25 point increase in load factor and a 7 increase in prasm on a 3 decline in capacity the passenger mile yield increased 3 the increases in passenger revenue and prasm reflect 1 strong passenger demand and 2 revenue and network productivity improvements including rightsizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes as a result of our efforts to rightsize capacity in domestic markets we increased flying by our contract carriers 

  

index to financial statements international passenger revenue  international passenger revenue increased 28 generated by a 17 increase in rpms on a 16 increase in capacity and an 11 increase in prasm the passenger mile yield increased 9 these results reflect increases in service to international destinations primarily in the atlantic and latin america markets from the restructuring of our route network our mix of domestic versus international capacity was 67 and 33 respectively for 2007 compared to 71 and 29 respectively for 2006 

operating expense 

 

 operating expense was 181 billion for 2007 a 584 million or 3 increase compared to 2006 operating capacity increased 3 to 1518 billion asms due mainly to increases in service to international destinations primarily in the atlantic and latin america markets from the restructuring of our route network and higher contract carrier flying from our initiatives to rightsize capacity cost per available seat mile “casm” increased 1 to 1190¢ 

aircraft fuel and related taxes  aircraft fuel and related taxes increased primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased mainline consumption these increases were partially offset by gains on our fuel hedging derivatives fuel prices averaged 221 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 51 million for 2007 compared to 210 per gallon including fuel hedge losses of 108 million for 2006 

salaries and related costs  the decrease in salaries and related costs reflects a decline of 1 382 million due to benefit cost reductions for our pilot and nonpilot employees and 2 90 million due to a charge during 2006 associated with accounting adjustments discussed above these decreases were partially offset by 1 expense associated with sharebased compensation resulting from equity awards granted upon emergence from bankruptcy and 2 an 8 increase in mainline headcount due to our expansion at new yorkjfk and our assumption of atlantic southeast airlines inc “asa” ramp operations in atlanta 

contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense increased due to a 16 growth in contract carrier flying from our business plan initiatives to rightsize capacity in domestic markets and due to higher average fuel prices fuel prices for our contract carriers averaged 237 per gallon for 2007 compared to 222 per gallon for 2006 

  

index to financial statements depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased primarily due to 1 a lower depreciable asset base resulting from 127 million in fresh start adjustments discussed above and 2 2006 adjustments to accelerate depreciation on certain limited life parts and aircraft these decreases were partially offset by amortization expense of 146 million related to intangibles created in connection with the fresh start adjustments discussed above 

contracted services  the increase in contracted services is primarily due to 1 higher outsourcing related to information technology cargo handling services and our aircraft cleaning services 2 international expansion and 3 new yorkjfk facility improvements 

landing fees and other rents landing fees and other rents decreased primarily due to a charge recorded in 2006 associated with accounting adjustments discussed above and due to benefits of restructuring certain contracts and lease obligations in bankruptcy 

aircraft rent the decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to the renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our restructuring under chapter 11 and fresh start adjustments discussed above 

profit sharing  our broadbased employee profit sharing plan provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined we will pay at least 15 of that profit to eligible employees based on our pretax earnings we accrued 158 million under the profit sharing plan for 2007 

operating income and operating margin 

we reported operating income of 11 billion and 58 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively operating margin which is the ratio of operating income to operating revenues was 6 and less than 1 for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

other expense income 

other expense net for 2007 was 492 million compared to 820 million for 2006 this change is substantially attributable to 1 a 25 or 218 million net decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of the dip facility in connection with our emergence from chapter 11 and fresh start adjustments discussed above partially offset by interest expense on borrowings under a senior secured exit financing facility which we entered into in conjunction with our emergence from bankruptcy the “exit facilities” 2 a 59 million increase in interest income primarily from interest earned due to bankruptcy initiatives that was classified within reorganization items net in 2006 and 3 a 51 million increase to miscellaneous net primarily related to fuel hedge losses in 2006 and foreign currency gains in 2007 due to an increased number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 

reorganization items net 

reorganization items net totaled a 12 billion gain for 2007 for additional information about these items see “results of operations—2008 compared to 2007 combined” 

reorganization items net totaled a 62 billion charge for 2006 primarily consisting of the following 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

 income tax provision benefit 

for 2007 we recorded an income tax provision totaling 207 million for additional information about this provision see “results of operations—2008 compared to 2007 combined” 

for 2006 we recorded an income tax benefit totaling 765 million the amount primarily reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the delta pilot plan and pilot nonqualified plan obligations upon each plan’s termination 

financial condition and liquidity 

our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 45 billion at december 31 2008 compared to 28 billion at december 31 2007 this increase primarily reflects our merger with northwest in which we acquired 24 billion of cash and cash equivalents 10 billion we received from american express for an advance purchase of skymiles and the borrowing of 10 billion under the revolving facility that is a part of our senior secured exit financing facilities the “exit facilities” partially offset by 12 billion of fuel hedge margin that we were required to post with counterparties 

the counterparties under our fuel hedge contracts have the right to require us to secure our obligations under those contracts by posting the margin associated with any loss position on those contracts our contracts related to the margin balance as of the end of 2008 generally settle during the first half of 2009 if fuel prices continue to fall we may be required to post additional collateral under those contracts 

we expect to meet our cash needs for 2009 from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and financing arrangements we have an undrawn 500 million revolving credit facility with respect to our aircraft order commitments at december 31 2008 we have financing commitments from third parties cancellation rights or definitive agreements to sell certain aircraft to third parties immediately following delivery of those aircraft to us by the manufacturer 

while we do not currently anticipate a need to access the capital markets to meet our cash needs in 2009 the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may restrict our ability to access the markets at a time when we would like or need to do so these conditions could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms for future needs could be affected by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens 

the financing agreements of delta and its subsidiaries contain certain affirmative negative and financial covenants we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2008

combined sources and uses of cash 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash used in operating activities totaled 17 billion for 2008 and cash provided by operating activities was 14 billion for 2007 cash used in operating activities for 2008 reflects 1 an increase in aircraft fuel payments due to record high fuel prices for most of the year 2 the posting of 11 billion in margin with counterparties primarily from our estimated fair value loss position on our fuel hedge contracts at december 31 2008 3 the payment of 438 million in premiums for fuel hedge derivatives entered into during 2008 4 a 444 million decrease in advance ticket sales due to the slowing economy and 5 the payment of 158 million in 2008 under our broadbased employee profit sharing plan related to 2007 cash used in operating activities was partially offset by cash flows driven by a 35 billion increase in operating revenue 20 billion of which is directly attributable to northwest’s operations since the closing date 

cash flows from operating activities in 2007 reflect 875 million in cash used under delta’s plan of reorganization to satisfy bankruptcyrelated obligations under our comprehensive agreement with alpa and settlement agreement with the pbgc cash flows from operating activities during 2007 also reflect 1 the release of 804 million from restricted cash pursuant to an amendment to our visamastercard credit card processing agreement 2 revenue and network productivity improvements including rightsizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes and 3 a 476 million decrease in shortterm investments primarily from sales of auction rate securities 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash provided by investing activities totaled 16 billion for 2008 and cash used in investing activities was 625 million for 2007 cash provided by investing activities in 2008 reflects 1 the inclusion of 24 billion in cash and cash equivalents from northwest in the merger and 2 609 million in restricted cash and cash 

  

index to financial statements equivalents primarily related to 500 million of cash from a northwest borrowing that was released from escrow these inflows were partially offset by investments of 13 billion for flight equipment and 241 million for ground property and equipment 

cash used in investing activities in 2007 reflects investments of 810 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and 226 million for ground property and equipment during 2007 restricted cash decreased by 185 million in addition we received 34 million and 83 million from the sale of our investments in pricelinecom incorporated and arinc incorporated respectively 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities totaled 17 billion for 2008 and cash used in financing activities was 120 million in 2007 cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily reflects 1 10 billion in borrowings under the revolving facility 2 10 billion received under the american express agreement for an advance purchase of skymiles and 3 10 billion from aircraft financing cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of 16 billion of longterm debt and capital lease obligations 

cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily reflects 1 the repayment of the dip facility with a portion of the proceeds available under the exit facilities and existing cash 2 the prepayment of 863 million of secured debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of enhanced equipment trust certificates and 3 scheduled principal payments on longterm debt and capital lease obligations during 2007 we also received 181 million in proceeds from an amendment to certain financing arrangements in which the outstanding principal amount was increased to 415 million and the interest rate we pay under this facility was reduced 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 that relate to debt operating leases aircraft order commitments capital leases contract carrier obligations other material noncancelable purchase obligations and other commitments the table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes 

 

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

 our firm orders to purchase 33 b737800 aircraft include 31 b737800 aircraft which we have entered into definitive agreements to sell to two third parties immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer we have not received any notice that these parties have defaulted on their purchase obligations these sales will reduce our future commitments by approximately 13 billion during the period from 2009 through 2011 490 million 730 million and 40 million for 2009 2010 and 2011 respectively 

 

  

  

  

 the following items are not included in the table above 

pension plans we sponsor qualified defined contribution “dc plans” and defined benefit pension plans “db plans” for eligible employees and retirees our funding obligations for these plans are governed by erisa estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions including those described below 

dc plans during 2008 we contributed approximately 215 million to our dc plans or directly to employees that otherwise would have been contributed to the dc plans on their behalf but for limits imposed by the internal revenue code in 2009 we expect to contribute approximately 300 million related to our dc plans 

db plans during 2008 we contributed approximately 115 million to our db plans which include a defined benefit pension plan for eligible nonpilot delta employees and retirees the “delta nonpilot plan” and defined benefit pension plans for eligible northwest employees and retirees the “northwest pension plans” these plans have been frozen for future benefit accruals 

the pension protection act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules “alternative funding rules” for defined benefit plans that are frozen under the alternative funding rules the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be funded over a fixed 17year period and is calculated using an 885 interest rate delta elected the alternative funding rules for the delta nonpilot plan effective april 1 2007 and northwest elected the alternative funding rules for the northwest pension plans effective october 1 2006 

the alternative funding rules allow us to reduce the funding obligations for the delta nonpilot plan and the northwest pension plans over the next several years compared to what our funding obligations would be under rules applicable to other db plans while the alternative funding rules also make our funding obligations for these plans more predictable our estimates of future funding requirements of the delta nonpilot plan and 

  

index to financial statements northwest pension plans are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control including among other things the market performance of assets statutory requirements and demographic data for participants including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations 

we estimate that the funding requirements for the delta nonpilot plan and the northwest pension plans will total approximately 275 million in 2009 due primarily to the recent decline in the investment markets we expect our contributions to these plans to significantly increase for 2010 and thereafter 

contract carrier agreements  during the year ended december 31 2008 seven regional air carriers “contract carriers” operated for us in addition to our whollyowned subsidiaries comair inc “comair” compass airlines inc “compass” and mesaba aviation inc “mesaba” pursuant to capacity purchase agreements under these agreements the regional air carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight designator codes and we control the scheduling pricing reservations ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those flights we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services 

the above table shows our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase agreements excluding comair compass and mesaba the obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the contract carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as for fuel labor maintenance insurance catering property tax and landing fees accordingly our actual payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set forth in the table above 

for information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with chautauqua and shuttle america see “contingencies related to termination of contract carrier agreements” in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fin 48 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” on january 1 2007 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 is 29 million we have accrued 5 million for the payment of interest and 8 million for the payment of penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits 

we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service for the 2005 through 2007 tax years the audit is substantially complete and is expected to close in early 2009 

legal contingencies  we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought 

other contingent obligations under contracts  in addition to the contractual obligations discussed above we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment as defined by each respective contract if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs 

for additional information about other contingencies not discussed above as well as information related to general indemnifications see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

frequent flyer programs we have a frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” offering incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on delta contract carriers and participating airlines as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we also sell mileage credits to other airlines and to nonairline businesses mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our crown room club and for other program awards 

in the merger we assumed northwest’s frequent flyer program the “worldperks program” we are consolidating the skymiles and worldperks programs which will ultimately provide for the combining of miles from each program at a onetoone ratio the worldperks program is accounted for under the same methodology as the skymiles program 

we use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits the fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines currently 00054 per mile and is reevaluated at least annually under the residual method the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted average price of all miles that have been deferred the portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value is recognized in income immediately and classified as other net revenue 

for mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the estimate of breakage is based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate of the fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years at december 31 2008 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with our frequent flyer programs was 51 billion a hypothetical 1 change in our outstanding number of miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 49 million impact on our deferred revenue liability 

purchase accounting measurements on the closing date northwest revalued its assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” “sfas 141” these changes in value did not result in gains or losses but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from northwest in the merger additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values as well as changes in other assumptions could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill 

the fair value of northwest’s debt and capital lease obligations was determined by estimating the present value of amounts to be paid at appropriate interest rates as of the closing date these rates were determined with swap rates libor rates and market spreads as of the closing date the market spreads which were determined with the assistance of third party financial institutions took into consideration the credit risk and the structure of the instruments as well as the underlying collateral supporting the instruments 

  

index to financial statements fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant unobservable inputs which generally include a fiveyear business plan 12months of historical revenues and expenses by city pair projections of available seat miles revenue passenger miles load factors and operating costs per available seat mile and a discount rate 

one of the significant inputs underlying the intangible fair value measurements performed on the closing date is the discount rate we determined the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry which was measured using a capital asset pricing model “capm” the capm in the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles utilized a 50 debt and 50 equity structure the historical average debttoequity structure of the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50 debt and 50 equity which was similar to northwest’s debttoequity structure at emergence from chapter 11 the return on debt was measured using a bidtoyield analysis of major airline corporate bonds the expected market rate of return for equity was measured based on the risk free rate the airline industry beta and risk premiums based on the federal reserve statistical release h 15 or ibbotson ® stocks bonds bills and inflation ® valuation yearbook edition 2008 these factors resulted in a 13 discount rate this compares to an 11 discount rate used at emergence by northwest 

the fair value of northwest’s pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans funded status as of the closing of the merger any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability one of the significant assumptions in determining our projected benefit obligation is the discount rate we determined the discount rate primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to estimated future benefit payments which resulted in a weighted average discount rate of 78 other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate retirement age and mortality assumptions these assumptions are discussed further in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

derivative instruments in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices we periodically enter into derivative instruments comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements including those of our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements we record our derivative contracts in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity” “sfas 133” our fuel derivative instruments are valued using market data derived from quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves and volatilities 

we believe our fuel hedge contracts will be highly effective during their term in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the volatility in jet fuel prices we perform both a prospective and retrospective assessment to this effect at least quarterly including assessing the possibility of counterparty default if we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedge on our consolidated statements of operations as a result of our effectiveness assessment at december 31 2008 we believe our hedge contracts will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the volatility in jet fuel prices 

  

index to financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill reflects 1 the excess of the reorganization value of the successor over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities from the adoption of fresh start reporting adjusted for impairment and 2 the excess of purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from northwest in the merger the following table reflects the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

 during the march 2008 quarter we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization driven primarily by record fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions in addition the announcement of our intention to merge with northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of delta and northwest for additional information about the merger see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we determined that these factors combined with further increases in fuel prices were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required pursuant to sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” as a result we estimated fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows supported with a marketbased valuation we determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a noncash charge of 69 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 in estimating fair value we based our estimates and assumptions on the same valuation techniques employed and levels of inputs used to estimate the fair value of goodwill upon adoption of fresh start reporting 

identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets 1 recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and 2 acquired in the merger indefinitelived assets are not amortized definitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts 

in addition to the goodwill impairment charge we recorded a noncash charge of 357 million 238 million after tax for the year ended december 31 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values 

in accordance with sfas 142 we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis the annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is october 1 

in evaluating our goodwill for impairment we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering 1 our market capitalization 2 any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest “control premium” 3 the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest 4 market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and 5 projected discounted future cash flows if reasonably estimable if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value no further testing is required if however the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value fair value is estimated based on recent market transactions where available or projected discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 

  

index to financial statements at october 1 2008 we performed an impairment test of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which resulted in no impairment charge for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets changes in assumptions or circumstances including but not limited to 1 negative trends in our market capitalization 2 volatile fuel prices 3 declining passenger mile yields 4 lower demand as a result of the weakening us and global economy 5 interruption to our operations due to an employee strike terrorist attack or other reasons andor 6 consolidation of competitors within the industry which are not offset by other factors such as improved yield or an increase in control premiums could result in an impairment in the year in which the change occurs and in future years for additional information about our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets see notes 1 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets  our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 206 billion on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 this value is based on various factors including the assets’ estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if we decide to permanently remove flight equipment or other longlived assets from operations these assets will be evaluated under sfas 144 and could result in an impairment the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 

in order to evaluate potential impairment as required by sfas 144 we group assets at the fleet type level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available for additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of longlived assets see notes 1 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income tax valuation allowance and contingencies  in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical earnings and losses our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and potential current and future tax planning strategies 

our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest we review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations conclusion of tax audits a change in exposure based on current calculations identification of new issues release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue we would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

prior to january 1 2009 in the event that an adjustment to the income tax provision relates to a preemergence tax position or northwest mergerrelated tax position we would adjust goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying value of these assets is zero beginning january 1 2009 any adjustments to the income tax provision in regard to preemergence tax positions will be made through the income tax provision pursuant to sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r”

index to financial statements pension plans  we sponsor db plans for our eligible employees and retirees we currently estimate that expense for our db plans in 2009 will be approximately 420 million the effect of our db plans on our consolidated financial statements is subject to many assumptions we believe the most critical assumptions are 1 the weighted average discount rate and 2 the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans for additional information regarding these assumptions see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate of 649 and 637 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively additionally our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 567 to 719 between 2006 and 2008 due to remeasurements throughout the year the impact of a 050 change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below 

the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans is based primarily on plan specific investment studies using historical returns on our db plans’ assets with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts modest excess return expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically we review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually these assumptions are largely based on the asset category rateofreturn assumptions developed annually with our pension investment advisors however our annual investment performance for one particular year does not by itself significantly influence our evaluation the investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds a 9 annualized return target the impact of a 050 change in our expected longterm rate of return is shown in the table below

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in march 2008 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment to fasb statement 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about 1 how and why an entity uses derivative instruments 2 how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas 133 and 3 how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on january 1 2009 we currently provide significant information about our hedging activities and use of derivatives in our quarterly and annual filings accordingly we expect the adoption of sfas 161 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 

  

index to financial statements in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141r sfas 141r provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosure of information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination it also revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting under sfas 141 any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero by contrast sfas 141r requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income tax provision sfas 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on january 1 2009 for additional information regarding sfas 141r see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under sfas 133 to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders’ equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel we periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices 

  

index to financial statements for 2008 aircraft fuel and related taxes including our contract carriers accounted for 28 of our total operating expense aircraft fuel and related taxes increased 53 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher average fuel prices fuel prices averaged 316 per gallon including fuel hedge losses of 65 million for 2008 compared to 224 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 51 million for 2007 

in the merger we assumed all of northwest’s outstanding fuel hedge contracts on the closing date we designated certain of northwest’s derivative instruments comprised of crude oil collar and swap contracts as hedges in accordance with sfas 133 as of december 31 2008 these contracts had an estimated fair value loss of 163 million the remaining northwest derivative contracts that were not designated as hedges had an estimated fair value loss of 318 million we will marktomarket the derivative contracts not designated as hedges on a monthly basis in aircraft fuel expense and related taxes the marktomarket on these contracts may result in increased volatility in earnings compared to our fuel hedge contracts designated under sfas 133 for which changes in underlying commodity prices result in valuation changes that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

in september 2008 one of our fuel hedge contract counterparties lehman brothers holdings inc “lehman brothers” filed for bankruptcy as a result we terminated our fuel hedge contracts with lehman brothers prior to their scheduled settlement dates additionally during the december 2008 quarter we terminated certain fuel hedge contracts with other counterparties to reduce our exposure to projected fuel hedge losses due to the decrease in crude oil prices in accordance with sfas 133 we recorded an unrealized loss of 324 million which represents the effective portion of these terminated contracts at the date of settlement in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet these losses will be reclassified into earnings in accordance with their original contract settlement dates through december 2009 the ineffective portion of these contracts at the date of settlement resulted in an 11 million charge 

  

index to financial statements as of january 31 2009 our open fuel hedging position excluding contracts we terminated early for the years ending december 31 2009 and 2010 is as follows 

 the following table shows the projected impact to aircraft fuel expense and fuel hedge margin based on the impact of our open fuel hedge contracts at january 31 2009 excluding contracts we terminated early assuming the following per barrel of crude oil sensitivities for 2009 

 

   interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest 

  

index to financial statements rates we had 82 billion and 45 billion of fixedrate debt and 97 billion and 38 billion of variablerate debt at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively at december 31 2008 an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 155 million inclusive of the impact of our interest rate swap agreements and increased interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 92 million inclusive of the impact of our interest rate swap and cap agreements 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expense our largest exposure comes from the japanese yen in general a weakening yen relative to the us dollar results in 1 our operating income being unfavorably impacted to the extent net yendenominated revenues exceed expenses and 2 recognition of a nonoperating foreign currency gain due to the remeasurement of net yendenominated liabilities to manage exchange rate risk we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable we believe changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our results of operations

 item 1 business tableend general description 

we are a major air carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the us and around the world we offered customers service to more destinations than any other global airline with delta and delta connection carrier service to 321 destinations in 58 countries in january 2008 we have added more international capacity than any other major us airline since january 2006 and are the leader across the atlantic with flights to 36 transatlantic markets to latin america and the caribbean we offered more than 500 weekly flights to 63 destinations in january 2008 we are a founding member of skyteam a global airline alliance that provides customers with extensive worldwide destinations flights and services including our skyteam and worldwide codeshare partners we offered flights to 485 worldwide destinations in 106 countries in january 2008 

for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 passenger revenue accounted for 88 88 and 89 of our consolidated operating revenue respectively and cargo revenue and other sources accounted for 12 12 and 11 of our consolidated operating revenue respectively in 2007 our operations in north america the atlantic latin america and the pacific accounted for 72 20 7 and 1 respectively of our consolidated operating revenue in 2006 our operations in north america the atlantic latin america and the pacific accounted for 75 18 6 and 1 respectively of our consolidated operating revenue in 2005 our operations in north america the atlantic latin america and the pacific accounted for 78 16 5 and 1 respectively of our consolidated operating revenue 

we are incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware our principal executive offices are located at hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport in atlanta georgia the “atlanta airport” our telephone number is 404 7152600 and our internet address is wwwdeltacom information contained on this website is not part of and is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k 

airline operations 

our route network is centered around the hub system we operate at airports in atlanta cincinnati new yorkjfk and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes delta flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to domestic and international cities and to other delta hubs our hub system also provides passengers with access to our principal international gateways in atlanta and new yorkjfk 

as briefly discussed below other key characteristics of our route network include our alliances with foreign airlines the delta connection program the delta shuttle and our domestic marketing alliances including with continental airlines inc “continental” and northwest airlines inc “northwest” 

international alliances 

we have formed bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions common use of airport gates and ticket counters ticket office colocation and other marketing agreements these alliances often present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing 

our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under international codesharing arrangements we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to 

  

index to financial statements offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our “dl” designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s twoletter designator code we have international codeshare arrangements in effect with aeromexico air france alitalia avianca china airlines china southern csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air and royal air maroc and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with these airlines 

in october 2007 we entered into a joint venture agreement with air france to share revenues and costs on transatlantic routes the initial implementation of the joint venture in april 2008 will include flights operated by both carriers between air france’s parischarles de gaulle parisorly and lyon hubs and our atlanta cincinnati newyorkjfk and salt lake city hubs as well as all flights between london heathrow airport and the us by 2010 the joint venture is scheduled to be extended to all transatlantic flights operated by air france and delta between north america and europe and the mediterranean as well as all flights between los angeles and tahiti 

in addition to our agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam international airline alliance the other full members of skyteam are aeroflot aeromexico air france alitalia continental csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air and northwest one goal of skyteam is to link the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations 

in 2002 we air france alitalia csa czech airlines and korean air received limited antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation “dot” that enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales marketing and discount programs for customers 

in june 2007 we air france alitalia csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines and northwest applied with the dot for antitrust immunity for certain transatlantic coordination included in the application is a tentative joint venture agreement among us air france klm and northwest that would if implemented create a comprehensive and integrated partnership among the four skyteam members across the atlantic a more integrated skyteam alliance would offer significant advantages to consumers including more choice in flight schedules travel times services and fares this application was the first under the landmark european unionunited states open skies treaty 

delta connection program 

the delta connection program is our regional carrier service which feeds traffic to our route system through contracts with regional air carriers that operate flights serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities the program enables us to increase the number of flights we have in certain locations to better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets 

through the delta connection program we have contractual arrangements with nine regional carriers to operate regional jet and in certain cases turboprop aircraft using our “dl” designator code our whollyowned subsidiary comair inc “comair” operates all of its flights under our code atlantic southeast airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest inc “skywest” operates all of its flights under our code in addition we have agreements with the following regional carriers that operate some of their flights using our code skywest airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest chautauqua airlines inc a subsidiary of republic airways holdings inc “republic holdings” shuttle america corporation a subsidiary of republic holdings freedom airlines inc a subsidiary of mesa air group inc pinnacle airlines inc expressjet airlines inc and american eagle airlines inc “eagle” 

  

index to financial statements we generally pay the regional carriers including comair amounts defined in their respective contract carrier agreements which are based on a determination of the carriers’ respective costs of operating their delta connection flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these capacity purchase agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least ten years which grant us the option to extend the initial term and provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement for convenience at certain future dates our arrangements with eagle which is limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of the flights operated by skywest airlines and expressjet are structured as revenue proration agreements these proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

delta shuttle 

we operate a high frequency service targeted to northeast business travelers known as the delta shuttle the delta shuttle provides nonstop hourly service on business days between new york—laguardia airport “laguardia” and both boston—logan international airport and washington dc—ronald reagan national airport “reagan” 

domestic alliances 

we have entered into marketing alliances with 1 continental and northwest including regional carriers affiliated with each and 2 alaska airlines and horizon air industries both of which include mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements these marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks 

fuel 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2005 through 2007 

 

  

  our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

  

index to financial statements competition 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta and new yorkjfk from other carriers in addition our operations at our hub airports also compete with operations at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face increasing competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from rapidly expanding regional jet operators our ability to compete effectively depends in significant part on our ability to maintain a cost structure that is competitive with other carriers 

in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies agreement with the member states of the european union has accelerated this trend through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers 

frequent flyer program 

we have a frequent flyer program the skymiles ® program which offers incentives to customers to increase travel on delta this program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta connection carriers and participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies telecommunication services and internet services in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months’ advance notice and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice 

mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our crown room club and for other program participant awards travel awards are subject to certain transfer restrictions and capacitycontrolled seating in some cases blackout dates may apply program accounts with no activity for 12 consecutive months after enrollment are deleted miles will not expire so long as at least once every two years the participant 1 takes a qualifying flight on delta or a delta connection carrier 2 earns miles through one of our program participants 3 buys miles from delta or 4 redeems miles for any program award 

regulatory matters 

the dot and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the us the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

  

index to financial statements authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international route awards are also subject to the approval of the president of the us for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

the transportation security administration and the us customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the us 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the us department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

airlines set ticket prices in most domestic and international city pairs without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and to a limited extent by exemptions issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the us and the foreign country or countries involved changes in us or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the us and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time 

certain of our international route and codesharing authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

airport access 

operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

in the us the faa currently regulates the allocation of slots slot exemptions operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at reagan in washington dc o’hare international airport in chicago and laguardia and jfk in new york our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities similarly our operations at tokyo’s narita airport london’s gatwick airport london’s heathrow airport beginning in late march 2008 and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the international air transport association’s worldwide scheduling guidelines and applicable local law we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our 

  

index to financial statements existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

environmental matters 

the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the international civil aviation organization “icao” our aircraft comply with the existing epa standards as applicable by engine design date icao has adopted additional aircraft engine emissions standards applicable to engines certified after december 31 2007 but the epa has not yet proposed a rule that incorporates these new icao standards 

we are also subject to various other federal state and local laws governing environmental matters including the management and disposal of chemicals waste and hazardous materials protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and drinking water concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the us and abroad we are carefully monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such regulatory developments regulation of greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry 

we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site and liability at many of these sites have been or will be resolved through our chapter 11 proceedings we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

civil reserve air fleet program 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international range aircraft from october 1 2007 until september 30 2008 as of october 1 2007 the following numbers of our international range aircraft are available for craf activation 

 

 the craf program has only been activated twice both times at the stage i level since it was created in 1951 

  

index to financial statements regulatory and legislative proposals 

a number of congressional bills and proposed dot regulations have been considered in recent years to address airline competition and other issues some of these proposals would require large airlines with major operations at certain airports to divest or make available to other airlines slots gates facilities and other assets at those airports other measures would limit the service or pricing responses of major carriers that appear to target new entrant airlines in addition concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the dot and faa to consider various proposals for access to certain airports including “congestionbased” landing fees and programs that would withdraw slots from existing carriers and reallocate those slots either by lottery or auction to the highest bidder to carriers with little or no current presence at such airports these proposals if enacted could negatively impact our existing services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines furthermore recent events related to extreme weather delays have caused congress the dot and individual states to consider and in at least one case enact proposals related to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions 

employee matters 

railway labor act 

our relations with labor unions in the us are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class under the nmb’s usual rules a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of those employees vote for union representation a certified labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the president of the us appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

collective bargaining 

as of december 31 2007 we had a total of 55044 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 17 of these employees are represented by unions 

 

   

index to financial statements labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of employees of delta and comair that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes in february 2008 the association of flight attendantscommunication workers of america filed an application for election with the national mediation board asking it to conduct a representation election among delta flight attendants the timing and outcome of this matter cannot presently be determined

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors relating to delta 

our business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel continuing high fuel costs or further cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results likewise significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel fuel prices have increased substantially in the last five years in 2007 our average fuel price per gallon rose 5 to 221 as compared to an average price of 210 in 2006 which was 15 higher than our average price of 179 in 2005 in 2004 our average fuel price per gallon was 116 and in 2003 our average fuel price per gallon was 8178¢ the fuel costs represented 26 25 and 24 of our operating expenses in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively these increasing costs have had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited by the competitive nature of the airline industry we often have not been able to increase our fares to fully offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future 

in addition our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price to attempt to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure depending on the type of hedging instrument used our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be limited 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us 

our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 

we have substantial indebtedness which could 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition a substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we have 

  

index to financial statements historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business these liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions industry trends performance and many other factors not within our control 

our exit financing credit facility includes financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

our exit financing credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio minimum unrestricted cash reserves and minimum collateral coverage ratios in addition our exit financing credit facility restricts our ability to among other things incur additional secured indebtedness make investments sell assets if not in compliance with coverage ratio tests pay dividends or repurchase stock these covenants may have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition if we fail to comply with the covenants in the exit financing credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result under the exit financing credit facility 

the exit financing credit facility also contains other events of default customary for financings of this type including cross defaults to certain other material indebtedness and certain change of control events if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding borrowings under these agreements immediately due and payable we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance borrowings under the exit financing credit facility if such borrowings were accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under the exit financing credit facility could also result in an event of default under other indebtedness agreements 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants and other personnel approximately 17 of our workforce is unionized strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business relations between air carriers and labor unions in the us are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted 

in addition if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized they may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in cincinnati new yorkjfk and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at the atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

index to financial statements we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks “delta direct” phone banks and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver these expected benefits if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected 

in addition any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs like all companies our technology systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business 

if we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans our financial performance that culminated in our recent chapter 11 proceedings created uncertainty that led to a significant increase in unwanted attrition if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

our credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances the initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

we sell a substantial number of tickets that are paid for by customers who use credit cards our visamastercard credit card processing agreement provides that no future holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances under its processing agreement with us amex has the right in certain circumstances to impose a holdback of our receivables for tickets purchased using an american express credit card if circumstances were to occur that would allow either processor to initiate a holdback the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be significant 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability the insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate in the event that the insurance is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business for a description of the comair flight 5191 accident in august 2006 see “item 3 legal proceedings—comair flight 5191” 

any “ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses carryforwards 

under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “ internal revenue code ” a corporation is generally allowed a deduction in any taxable year for net operating losses carried forward from prior years as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 91 billion of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 

  

index to financial statements a corporation’s use of its net operating loss carryforwards is generally limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” when an “ownership change” occurs pursuant to the implementation of a plan of reorganization under the bankruptcy code the general limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code may not apply if certain requirements are satisfied under either section 382l5 or section 382l6 of the internal revenue code we experienced an “ownership change” in connection with the plan of reorganization in our chapter 11 proceedings but we have not yet determined whether we will be eligible for or rely on the special rule under section 382l5 or the special rule under section 382l6 assuming we rely on section 382l5 of the internal revenue code a second “ownership change” within two years from the effective date of our plan of reorganization confirmed by the bankruptcy court in our chapter 11 proceedings would eliminate completely our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers regardless of whether we rely on section 382l5 of the internal revenue code an “ownership change” after the effective date of the plan of reorganization could significantly limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards for taxable years including or following such “ownership change” 

transfer restrictions on our stock issued in connection with our plan of reorganization may limit the liquidity of our stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers our certificate of incorporation contains certain restrictions on the transfer of our stock issued in connection with the plan of reorganization these transfer restrictions will be effective for two years following the effective date of the plan of reorganization subject to extension for an additional three years these transfer restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our stock to dispose of or acquire shares of our stock during the period the restrictions are in place furthermore while the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an “ownership change” from occurring within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta and new yorkjfk from other carriers in addition our operations at our hub airports also compete with operations at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face increasing competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from rapidly expanding regional jet operators 

the growth of lowcost carriers including southwest airtran and jetblue in the us has placed significant competitive pressure on us and other network carriers in the domestic market in addition other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in light of increased jet fuel costs and other issues in recent years we expect consolidation to occur in the airline industry as a result of consolidation we may face significant competition from larger carriers that may be able to generate higher amounts of revenue and compete more efficiently 

in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways and others have significantly increased competition in international markets the adoption of liberalized open skies aviation agreements with an 

  

index to financial statements increasing number of countries around the world including in particular the open skies agreement with the member states of the european union has accelerated this trend through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which resulted in industrywide liquidity issues additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry would negatively affect us and the airline industry the potential negative effects include increased security insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the us 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues for example the aviation and transportation security act which became law in november 2001 mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax the proposed ticket tax increase if implemented could negatively impact our revenues 

recently proposals to address congestion at certain airports or in certain airspace particularly in the northeast us have included concepts such as “congestion pricing” “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace furthermore events related to extreme weather delays in late 2006 and early 2007 have caused congress and the dot to consider proposals related to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions the enactment of such proposals could have a significant negative impact on our operations in addition some states have also enacted or considered enacting such regulations 

future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry for example the european commission is seeking to impose an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the european union including flights to and from the us laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other us or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

index to financial statements we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the us certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the coverage currently extends through august 31 2008 the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially if available such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all resulting in an interruption to our operations

 ground facilities 

we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases we own a portion of our principal offices our atlanta reservations center and other real property in atlanta 

we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve at most airports that we serve we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other improvements and facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft these leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30 years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement examples of major leases and use agreements at delta hub or other significant airports that will expire in the next several years include among others 1 atlanta central passenger terminal lease and the airport use agreement which expire in 2010 2 salt lake city airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2008 and 3 laguardia terminal lease which expires in 2008 we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports including among others our main atlanta maintenance base atlanta air cargo facilities and hangar and air cargo facilities at the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport and salt 

  

index to financial statements lake city international airport our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities including in some cases amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction we also lease marketing ticketing and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms 

in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

the city of atlanta with our support and the support of other airlines is currently implementing portions of a ten year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport implementation of the cip should increase the number of flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays the cip includes among other things a 9000 foot fullservice runway that opened in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements if fully implemented the cip is currently estimated by the city of atlanta to cost approximately 68 billion which exceeds the 54 billion cip approved by the airlines in 1999 the cip runs through 2010 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds certain elements of the cip have been delayed and there is no assurance that the cip will be fully implemented failure to implement certain portions of the cip in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at the atlanta airport

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend background 

we are a major air carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states “us” and around the world we offered service including delta connection carrier service to 321 destinations in 58 countries in january 2008 we are a founding member of skyteam a global airline alliance that provides customers with extensive worldwide destinations flights and services including our skyteam and worldwide codeshare partners we offered flights to 485 worldwide destinations in 106 countries in january 2008 

on september 14 2005 the “petition date” we and substantially all of our subsidiaries collectively the “debtors” filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the “bankruptcy code” in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the “bankruptcy court” our reorganization in chapter 11 involved a fundamental transformation of our business 

on april 30 2007 the “effective date” we emerged from bankruptcy as a competitive airline with a global network in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy we began issuing shares of new common stock pursuant to the debtors’ joint plan of reorganization the “plan of reorganization” references in this form 10k to “successor” refer to delta on or after may 1 2007 after giving effect to 1 the cancellation of delta common stock issued prior to the effective date 2 the issuance of new delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the plan of reorganization and 3 the application of fresh start reporting references to “predecessor” refer to delta prior to may 1 2007 

combined financial results of the predecessor and successor 

upon emergence from chapter 11 we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position 907 “financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code” “sop 907” the adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes accordingly the consolidated financial statements on or after may 1 2007 are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements prior to that date due to our adoption of fresh start reporting on april 30 2007 the accompanying consolidated statements of operations include the results of operations for 1 the eight months ended december 31 2007 of the successor 2 the four months ended april 30 2007 of the predecessor and 3 the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 of the predecessor 

for purposes of management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 in this form 10k we combined the results of operations for the four months ended april 30 2007 of the predecessor with the eight months ended december 31 2007 of the successor we then compared the combined results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 with the corresponding period in the prior year of the predecessor and discussed significant fresh start reporting adjustments “fresh start adjustments” which impacted comparability 

we believe the combined results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 provide management and investors with a more meaningful perspective on delta’s ongoing financial and operational performance and trends than if we did not combine the results of operations of the predecessor and the successor in this manner similarly we combine the financial results of the predecessor and the successor when discussing our sources and uses of cash for the year ended december 31 2007 

overview of combined 2007 results 

in 2007 we recorded combined consolidated net income of 16 billion which includes a 12 billion gain from reorganization items net primarily reflecting a 21 billion gain in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy from an operational perspective we reported operating income of 11 billion for 2007 

  

index to financial statements due to the record high fuel costs experienced over the last several years aircraft fuel expense and related taxes have become our largest cost in an effort to manage these costs we hedged 38 of our fuel consumption in 2007 resulting in an average fuel price per gallon of 221 we realized 111 million in cash gains on fuel hedge contracts settled during the year 

consistent with our positive operating financial results for 2007 cash flows from operations generated 14 billion which are net of 875 million in cash used under the plan of reorganization to satisfy our bankruptcyrelated obligations to the air line pilots association “alpa” and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” during 2007 we strengthened our balance sheet through the payment of 10 billion in net debt including two then outstanding debtorinpossession financing facilities the “dip facility” our bankruptcyrelated obligations to alpa and the pbgc and certain other higher interestbearing debt maturities we also invested more than 10 billion in capital expenditures focused primarily on customer service initiatives such as new flight equipment and improvements at our atlanta and new yorkjfk hubs 

business initiatives 

recent initiatives that we expect will generate positive momentum in our business include 

 

  

  

  

 in late 2007 our board of directors established a special committee of the board to work with management to review and analyze strategic options including potential consolidation transactions to assist us in maintaining our leadership position in the airline industry any decision of the board of directors regarding strategic options will be based on the best longterm interests of all delta stakeholders including stockholders employees customers and the communities we serve 

  

index to financial statements fresh start adjustments 

during the eight months ended december 31 2007 fresh start adjustments impacted our consolidated financial statements these adjustments resulted in a 157 million increase to pretax income for the year ended december 31 2007 the fresh start adjustments consist of the following 

 

 skymiles frequent flyer program  we revalued our frequent flyer award liability to estimated fair value and changed our accounting policy from an incremental cost method to a deferred revenue method fair value represents the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation of redeeming miles under the skymiles program fresh start adjustments for the skymiles program including the change in accounting policy for that program increased operating revenue by 188 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

fuel hedging  prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting on april 30 2007 we recorded as a component of shareowners’ deficit in other comprehensive loss 46 million of deferred gains related to our fuel hedging program this gain would have been recognized as an offset to fuel expense as the underlying fuel hedge contracts were settled however as required by fresh start reporting accumulated other comprehensive loss prior to emergence from chapter 11 was reset to zero accordingly fresh start adjustments resulted in a noncash increase to fuel expense of 46 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

depreciation  we revalued property and equipment to fair value which reduced the net book value of these assets by 10 billion in addition we adjusted the depreciable lives of flight equipment to reflect revised estimated useful lives as a result depreciation expense decreased by 127 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

amortization of intangible assets  we valued our intangible assets at fair value which increased the net book value of intangible assets excluding goodwill by 29 billion of which 956 million relates to amortizable intangible assets as a result amortization expense increased by 146 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs  we changed the way we account for certain maintenance parts that were previously capitalized and depreciated after emergence we expense these parts as they are placed on the aircraft this change resulted in an increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense of 52 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

interest expense  the revaluation of our debt and capital lease obligations resulted in a decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of premiums from adjusting these obligations to fair value during 2007 33 million in future premium credits were accelerated in connection with accounting for 1 the amendment to our 

  

index to financial statements spare parts credit facility the “spare parts loan” with general electric capital corporation “gecc” and 2 the prepayment of certain secured debt with the proceeds from the sale of 14 billion of pass through certificates series 20071 the “20071 certificates” as a result interest expense decreased by 70 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

other fresh start adjustments  we recorded other fresh start adjustments relating primarily to the revaluation of our aircraft leases these adjustments increased operating expense by 19 million and nonoperating expense by 3 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

sharebased compensation expense 

upon emergence from bankruptcy and in connection with our plan of reorganization we adopted a new compensation program which was approved by the bankruptcy court for our approximately 1200 officers director level employees and other management personnel the “management program” under the management program officers received restricted stock stock options and performance shares directorlevel employees received restricted stock and stock options and other management personnel received restricted stock during the eight months ended december 31 2007 the total compensation expense related to the management program was 109 million 

accounting adjustments 

during 2006 we recorded certain outofperiod adjustments “accounting adjustments” in our consolidated financial statements that affect the comparability of our results for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 these adjustments resulted in a net noncash charge approximating 310 million to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 consisting of 

 

  

  

 we believe the accounting adjustments considered individually and in the aggregate are not material to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 in making this assessment we considered qualitative and quantitative factors including our substantial net loss in these years the noncash nature of the accounting adjustments our substantial shareowners’ deficit at the end of these years and our status as a debtorinpossession under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code during these years 

reclassifications 

upon emergence and as a result of fresh start reporting we changed the classification of certain items on our consolidated statements of operations we also reclassified prior period amounts to conform to current period presentations these changes have no impact on operating or net income in any period prior or subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy for more information about these reclassifications see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements north american passenger revenue  north american passenger revenue increased 3 driven by a 25 point increase in load factor and a 7 increase in prasm on a 3 decline in capacity the passenger mile yield increased 3 the increases in passenger revenue and prasm reflect 1 strong passenger demand and 2 revenue and network productivity improvements including rightsizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes as a result of our efforts to rightsize capacity in domestic markets we increased flying by our contract carriers 

international passenger revenue  international passenger revenue increased 28 generated by a 17 increase in rpms on a 16 increase in capacity and an 11 increase in prasm the passenger mile yield increased 9 these results reflect increases in service to more profitable international destinations primarily in the atlantic and latin america markets from the restructuring of our route network our mix of domestic versus international capacity was 67 and 33 respectively for 2007 compared to 71 and 29 respectively for 2006 

operating expense 

 

 operating expense was 181 billion for 2007 a 584 million or 3 increase compared to 2006 operating capacity increased 3 to 1518 billion asms due mainly to increases in service to international destinations primarily in the atlantic and latin america markets from the restructuring of our route network and higher contract carrier flying from our initiatives to rightsize capacity cost per available seat mile “casm” increased 1 to 1190¢ 

aircraft fuel and related taxes  aircraft fuel and related taxes increased primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased mainline consumption these increases were partially offset by gains on our fuel hedging derivatives fuel prices averaged 221 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 51 million for 2007 compared to 210 per gallon including fuel hedge losses of 108 million for 2006 

salaries and related costs  the decrease in salaries and related costs reflects a decline of 1 382 million due to benefit cost reductions for our pilot and nonpilot employees and 2 90 million due to a charge during 2006 associated with accounting adjustments discussed above these decreases were partially offset by 

  

index to financial statements 1 expense associated with sharebased compensation and 2 an 8 increase in mainline headcount due to our expansion at new yorkjfk and our assumption of asa ramp operations in atlanta 

contract carrier arrangements  contract carrier arrangements expense increased due to a 16 growth in contract carrier flying from our business plan initiatives to rightsize capacity in domestic markets and due to higher average fuel prices fuel prices for our contract carriers averaged 237 per gallon for 2007 compared to 222 per gallon for 2006 

depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased primarily due to 1 a lower depreciable asset base resulting from 127 million in fresh start adjustments discussed above and 2 2006 adjustments to accelerate depreciation on certain limited life parts and aircraft these decreases were partially offset by amortization expense of 146 million related to intangibles created in connection with the fresh start adjustments discussed above 

contracted services  the increase in contracted services is primarily due to 1 higher outsourcing related to information technology cargo handling services and our aircraft cleaning services 2 international expansion and 3 new yorkjfk facility improvements 

landing fees and other rents landing fees and other rents decreased primarily due to a charge recorded in 2006 associated with accounting adjustments discussed above and due to benefits of restructuring certain contracts and lease obligations in bankruptcy 

aircraft rent the decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to the renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our restructuring under chapter 11 and fresh start adjustments discussed above 

profit sharing  our broadbased employee profit sharing plan provides that for each year in which we have an annual pretax profit as defined we will pay at least 15 of that profit to eligible employees based on our pretax earnings we accrued 158 million under the profit sharing plan for 2007 

operating income and operating margin 

we reported operating income of 11 billion and 58 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively operating margin which is the ratio of operating income to operating revenues was 6 and less than 1 for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

other expense income 

other expense net for 2007 was 492 million compared to 820 million for 2006 this change is substantially attributable to 1 a 25 or 218 million net decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of the dip facility in connection with our emergence from chapter 11 and fresh start adjustments discussed above partially offset by interest expense on borrowings under a senior secured exit financing facility which we entered into in conjunction with our emergence from bankruptcy the “exit facilities” 2 a 59 million increase in interest income primarily from interest earned due to bankruptcy initiatives that was classified within reorganization items net in 2006 and 3 a 51 million increase to miscellaneous net primarily related to fuel hedge losses in 2006 and foreign currency gains in 2007 due to an increased number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies

index to financial statements income tax provision benefit 

for 2007 we recorded an income tax provision totaling 207 million we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets excluding the effect of the deferred tax liabilities that are unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the future we will continue to assess the need for a full valuation allowance in future periods in accordance with sop 907 the reduction of the valuation allowance associated with the realization of preemergence deferred tax assets will sequentially reduce the value of our recorded goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying cost of these assets is zero accordingly during 2007 we reduced goodwill by 211 million with respect to the realization of preemergence deferred tax assets 

for 2006 we recorded an income tax benefit totaling 765 million the amount primarily reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the pilot plan and pilot nonqualified plan obligations upon each plan’s termination

operating revenue 

 

 operating revenue totaled 175 billion for 2006 a 11 billion or 6 increase compared to 2005 passenger revenue increased 6 while capacity decreased 6 the increase in passenger revenue is due to a rise of 10 and 12 in passenger mile yield and prasm respectively from fare increases that reflect strong passenger demand as well as actions we took during our chapter 11 proceedings to achieve revenue and network productivity improvements passenger revenue and other net revenue were negatively impacted by accounting adjustments discussed above passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to 1 a change in how we classify asa’s revenue as a result of its sale to skywest and 2 new contract carrier agreements with shuttle america corporation “shuttle america” and freedom airlines inc “freedom” effective september 1 2005

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2006 reflect an increase of 401 million in working capital compared to 2005 this increase was primarily a result of revenue and network productivity improvements restructuring initiatives and labor cost reductions implemented during our chapter 11 proceedings and an 

  

index to financial statements improved revenue environment our 2006 cash flows from operating activities also include a 116 million decrease in our restricted cash balance primarily due to a release of cash from restricted to operating under agreements we reached with certain vendors in 2005 our restricted cash balance increased significantly primarily due to cash holdbacks under our visamastercard credit card processing agreement 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash used in investing activities totaled 625 million and 361 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively cash used in investing activities in 2007 reflects an increase in investment of 545 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and 78 million for ground property and equipment during 2007 restricted cash decreased by 185 million in addition we received 34 million and 83 million from the sale of our investments in pricelinecom incorporated and arinc incorporated respectively 

cash used in investing activities totaled 361 million for 2006 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 22 million for 2005 this change reflects a 401 million decrease in cash used for the purchase of flight and ground equipment in 2006 our 2005 cash flows from investing activities include 842 million in proceeds from our sale of asa and certain flight equipment 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities totaled 120 million and 606 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily reflects 1 the repayment of the dip facility with a portion of the proceeds available under the exit facilities and existing cash 2 the prepayment of 863 million of secured debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 20071 certificates and 3 scheduled principal payments on longterm debt and capital lease obligations during 2007 we also received proceeds from an amendment to the spare parts loan as discussed above 

cash used in financing activities totaled 606 million for 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 830 million for 2005 this change is primarily due to the net proceeds we received under the dip facility shortly after our chapter 11 filing in 2005 while in chapter 11 we ceased making payments on our unsecured debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 that relate to debt operating leases aircraft order commitments capital leases contract carrier obligations other material noncancelable purchase obligations and other commitments the table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes 

 

    

index to financial statements         the following items are not included in the table above 

pension plans we sponsor qualified defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act “erisa” estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions including those described below 

defined contribution pension plans “dc plans” during 2007 we contributed approximately 112 million to our dc plans which include the delta familycare savings plan and the delta pilots defined contribution plan in addition to the 112 million contribution we paid approximately 61 million directly to employees that otherwise would have been contributed to the dc plans on their behalf but for limits imposed by the internal revenue code on contributions to such plans in 2008 we expect to contribute approximately 195 million to our dc plans or directly to employees once they reach the applicable internal revenue code limits 

  

index to financial statements defined benefit pension plans “db plans” during 2007 we contributed approximately 116 million to our db plans under our settlement agreement with the pbgc the pilot plan was terminated effective september 2 2006 in addition our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for pilots were terminated effective september 2 2006 

effective december 31 2005 future pay and service accruals under the nonpilot plan were frozen effective april 1 2007 we elected the alternative funding schedule under section 402a1 of the pension protection act of 2006 with respect to the nonpilot plan we also rejected in bankruptcy our nonqualified defined benefit plans for nonpilot employees as a result no further benefits will be paid from these nonqualified plans the pension protection act of 2006 allows us to reduce the funding obligations for the nonpilot plan over the next several years while this legislation makes our funding obligations for the nonpilot plan more predictable factors outside our control will continue to have an impact on the funding requirements for that plan 

estimates of future funding requirements for the nonpilot plan are based on various assumptions including among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets of the nonpilot plan statutory requirements the terms of the nonpilot plan and demographic data for participants in the nonpilot plan including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition 

assuming current funding rules we estimate that the funding requirements under the nonpilot plan for 2008 to 2012 will aggregate approximately 500 million 

contract carrier agreements  we have longterm capacity purchase agreements with several regional air carriers under these agreements the carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight code and we schedule those aircraft sell the seats on those flights and retain the related revenue we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services 

under these longterm capacity purchase agreements we are obligated to pay certain minimum fixed obligations which are included in the table above the remaining estimated expense is not included in the table because this expense is contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier flights by those air carriers as well as rates that are unknown at this time we cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expense under the contract carrier agreements in 2008 and thereafter 

for information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with chautauqua and shuttle america see “contingencies related to termination of contract carrier agreements” in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

fin 48 we adopted fin 48 on january 1 2007 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 is 143 million we have accrued 54 million for the payment of interest and 8 million for the payment of penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits 

we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service for the 2005 and 2006 tax years 

  

index to financial statements it is reasonably possible that during 2008 the settlement of bankruptcy claims will result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheet we cannot presently estimate the range of the reasonably possible outcomes 

legal contingencies  we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought 

other contingent obligations under contracts  in addition to the contractual obligations discussed above we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment as defined by each respective contract if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs 

for additional information about other contingencies not discussed above as well as information related to general indemnifications see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

freshstart reporting as previously noted upon emergence from chapter 11 we adopted fresh start reporting which required us to revalue our assets and liabilities to fair value in estimating fair value we based our estimates and assumptions on the guidance prescribed by sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which we were required to adopt in connection with our adoption of fresh start reporting sfas 157 among other things defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 

to facilitate the calculation of the enterprise value of the successor management developed a set of financial projections for the successor using a number of estimates and assumptions the enterprise and corresponding reorganization value of the successor was based on financial projections using various valuation methods including 1 a comparison of our projected performance to the market values of comparable companies 2 a review and analysis of several recent transactions in the airline industry and 3 a calculation of the present value of future cash flows based on our projections utilizing these methodologies the reorganization value of the successor was estimated to be in the range of 94 billion to 120 billion the enterprise value and corresponding reorganization value is dependent upon achieving the future financial results set forth in our projections as well as the realization of certain other assumptions there can be no assurance that the projections will be achieved or that the assumptions will be realized the excess reorganization value using the low end of the range over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities has been reflected as goodwill in the fresh start consolidated balance sheet the financial projections and estimates of enterprise and reorganization value are not incorporated into this form 10k 

all estimates assumptions and financial projections including the fair value adjustments the financial projections and the enterprise value and reorganization value projections are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and financial projections will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

  

index to financial statements for the impact that the adoption of fresh start reporting had on our consolidated balance sheet see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program the “skymiles program” we have a frequent flyer program offering incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on delta delta connection carriers and participating airlines as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies we also sell mileage credits to other airlines and to nonairline businesses mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our crown room club and for other program awards 

as a result of the adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy we revalued our skymiles frequent flyer award liability to estimated fair value the fair value of our skymiles frequent flyer award liability was determined based on the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation for miles expected to be redeemed under the skymiles program this estimated price was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of a skymiles award redeemed for travel on delta or a participating airline the weighted average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel at april 30 2007 we recorded deferred revenue equal to 00083 for each mile we estimate will ultimately be redeemed under the skymiles program 

upon emergence from bankruptcy we changed our accounting policy to a deferred revenue model for all frequent flyer miles we now account for all miles earned and sold as separate deliverables in a multiple element revenue arrangement as prescribed by eitf 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” 

we use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits the fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on the low end of the range of the prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines which price is currently 00054 per mile and will be reevaluated annually under the residual method the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted average price of all miles that have been deferred the portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value the marketing premium is recognized in income when the related services are provided and classified as other net revenue 

for mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed “breakage” we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the estimate of breakage which is currently 22 is based on historical redemption patterns a change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate of the fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years at december 31 2007 the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the skymiles program was 33 billion a hypothetical 1 change in our outstanding number of miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a 27 million impact on our deferred revenue liability 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill reflects the excess of the reorganization value of the successor over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets net of liabilities from the adoption of fresh start reporting we recorded 123 billion of goodwill upon emergence from bankruptcy 

identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trade name takeoff and arrival slots skyteam alliance agreements marketing agreements customer relationships and certain contracts these intangible assets excluding marketing agreements customer relationships and certain contracts are indefinitelived assets and are not amortized marketing agreements customer relationships and certain contracts are definitelived intangible assets and are amortized over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts 

  

index to financial statements in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we apply a fair valuebased impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis the annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is october 1 

in evaluating our goodwill for impairment we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering 1 our market capitalization 2 any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest “control premium” 3 the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest 4 market multiple and recent transactions values of peer companies and 5 projected discounted future cash flows if reasonably estimable if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value no further testing is required if however the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we then determine the amount of the impairment charge if any we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value fair value is estimated based on recent market transactions where available or projected discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 

at october 1 2007 we performed the annual required impairment test of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which resulted in no impairment charge for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets changes in assumptions or circumstances including but not limited to 1 longterm negative trends in our market capitalization 2 continued escalation of fuel prices 3 interruption to our operations due to employee strike terrorist attack etc andor 4 consolidation of competitors within the industry which are not offset by other factors such as improved yield or an increase in control premiums could result in an impairment in the year in which the change occurs and in future years for additional information about our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets see notes 2 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets  our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 117 billion on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 this value is based on various factors including the assets’ estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 

in order to evaluate potential impairment as required by sfas 144 we group assets at the fleet type level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available for additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of longlived assets see notes 2 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income tax valuation allowance and contingencies  in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical earnings and losses our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and potential current and future tax planning strategies 

  

index to financial statements our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest we review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations conclusion of tax audits a change in exposure based on current calculations identification of new issues release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known in the event that the adjustment pertains to a preemergence tax position we would adjust goodwill followed by other indefinitelived intangible assets until the net carrying value of these assets is zero beginning january 1 2009 any adjustments to preemergence tax positions will be made through the income tax provision pursuant to sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” 

for additional information about income taxes see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans  we sponsor db plans for our eligible employees and retirees the impact of these db plans on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2007 and 2006 and our consolidated statements of operations for the eight months ended december 31 2007 the four months ended april 30 2007 and the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 is presented in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we currently estimate that our defined benefit pension plan expense related to our nonpilot plan in 2008 will be approximately 35 million the effect of our db plans on our consolidated financial statements is subject to many assumptions we believe the most critical assumptions are 1 the weighted average discount rate and 2 the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans the pilot plan and pilot nonqualified defined benefit pension plans were terminated during 2006 for additional information regarding these terminations see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate of 608 and 588 at december 31 2007 and september 30 2006 respectively additionally our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 567 to 601 between 2005 and 2007 due to remeasurements throughout the year the impact of a 050 change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below 

the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans is based primarily on plan specific investment studies using historical returns on our db plans’ assets the investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds a 9 annualized return target our historical annualized three five 10 and 15 year rate of return on plan assets is approximately 13 14 8 and 11 respectively as of december 31 2007 the impact of a 050 change in our expected longterm rate of return is shown in the table below

index to financial statements recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas 141r sfas 141r provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosure of information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on january 1 2009 for additional information regarding sfas 141r see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

market risks associated with financial instruments 

we have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and shareowners’ equity 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

our results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel we periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel swap collar and call option contracts in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices 

for 2007 aircraft fuel and related taxes accounted for 26 of our total operating expenses aircraft fuel and related taxes for 2007 increased 6 compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average fuel prices fuel prices averaged 221 per gallon including fuel hedge gains of 51 million for 2007 compared to 210 per gallon including fuel hedge losses of 108 million for 2006 

as of january 31 2008 we have hedged a portion of our projected fuel requirements including those of our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements for the three years ending december 31 2010 using crude oil and heating oil call option and swap contracts as follows 

 

   

index to financial statements     for additional information regarding our exposure to market risks see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk from volatility in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates we had 45 billion of fixedrate debt and 38 billion of variablerate debt at december 31 2007 at december 31 2007 and 2006 a 10 increase in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by 332 million and 114 million respectively and increased interest expense on our variablerate longterm debt by 19 million and 24 million respectively at december 31 2007 and 2006 we did not have any interest rate swaps or contractual arrangements that would reduce our interest expense for additional information on our longterm debt see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

our route network is centered around the hub system we operate at airports in atlanta cincinnati new york john f kennedy international airport “jfk” and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes delta flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to domestic and international cities and to other delta hubs our hub system also provides passengers with access to our principal international gateways in atlanta and jfk 

 

as briefly discussed below other key characteristics of our route network include our alliances with foreign airlines the delta connection program the delta shuttle and our domestic marketing alliances including with continental airlines inc “continental” and northwest airlines inc “northwest” 

 

international alliances 

 

we have formed bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions common use of airport gates and ticket counters ticket office colocation and other marketing agreements these alliances often present opportunities in other areas such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing 

 

our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under international codesharing arrangements we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our “dl” designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s twoletter designator code we have international codeshare arrangements in effect with aeromexico air france air jamaica currently expected to terminate on april 30 2007 alitalia avianca china airlines china southern csa czech airlines el al israel airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air and royal air maroc and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with these airlines 

 

in addition to our agreements with individual foreign airlines we are a member of the skyteam international airline alliance the other full members of skyteam are aeroflot aeromexico air france alitalia continental csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines korean air and northwest one goal of skyteam is to link the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations 

 

in 2002 we air france alitalia  csa czech airlines and korean air received limited antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation the “dot” that enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales marketing and discount programs for customers 

 

delta   connection   program 

 

the delta connection program is our regional carrier service which feeds traffic to our route system through contracts with regional air carriers that operate flights serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities the program enables us to increase the number of flights we have in certain locations to better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets the delta connection program operates the largest number of regional jets in the united states 

 

 

through the delta connection program we have contractual arrangements with seven regional carriers to operate regional jet and in certain cases turboprop aircraft using our “dl” designator code our whollyowned subsidiary comair operates all of its flights under our code atlantic southeast airlines inc which we sold to skywest inc “skywest” in september 2005 continues to operate all of its flights under our code in addition we have agreements with the following regional carriers that operate some of their flights using our code skywest airlines inc a subsidiary of skywest chautauqua airlines inc a subsidiary of republic airways holdings inc “republic holdings” shuttle america corporation a subsidiary of republic holdings freedom airlines inc a subsidiary of mesa air group inc and american eagle airlines inc 

 

we generally pay the regional carriers including comair amounts defined in their respective contract carrier agreements which are based on a determination of the carriers’ respective cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services these agreements are longterm agreements usually with initial terms of at least ten years that grant us the option to extend the initial term and provide us the right to terminate the agreement for convenience at certain future dates our arrangement with eagle which is limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of the flights operated by skywest airlines are structured as revenue proration agreements these proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries for additional information regarding our contract carrier agreements see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

delta   shuttle 

 

we operate a high frequency service targeted to northeast business travelers known as the delta shuttle the delta shuttle provides nonstop hourly service on business days between new york  laguardia airport “laguardia” and both boston  logan international airport and washington dc  ronald reagan national airport “reagan” 

 

domestic   alliances 

 

we have entered into marketing alliances with 1 continental and northwest including regional carriers affiliated with each and 2 alaska airlines and horizon air industries both of which include mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements these marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks 

 

fuel 

 

our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2004 through 2006 

 

 

 

 

our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

 

 

we periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices information regarding our fuel hedging program is set forth under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — market risks associated with financial instruments — aircraft fuel price risk” in item 7 and in note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

 

competition 

 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta and jfk from other carriers in addition our operations at our hub airports also compete with operations at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs we also face increasing competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from rapidly expanding regional jet operators our ability to compete effectively depends in significant part on our ability to maintain a cost structure that is competitive with other carriers 

 

in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways and others have significantly increased competition in international markets through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers 

 

frequent   flyer program 

 

we have a frequent flyer program the skymiles ® program which offers incentives to customers to increase travel on delta this program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta connection carriers and participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program participants such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies telecommunication services and internet services in addition individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months’ advance notice and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice 

 

mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our crown room club and for other program participant awards travel awards are subject to certain transfer restrictions and capacitycontrolled seating in some cases blackout dates may apply program accounts with no activity for 12 consecutive months after enrollment are deleted miles will not expire so long as at least once every two years the participant 1 takes a qualifying flight on delta or a delta connection carrier 2 earns miles through one of our program participants 3 buys miles from delta or 4 redeems miles for any program award 

 

regulatory   matters 

 

the dot and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the united states the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds fit to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “essential air services” which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

 

 

the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

 

authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the governments of the foreign countries involved international route awards are also subject to the approval of the president of the united states for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

 

the transportation security administration and the united states customs and border protection each a division of the department of homeland security are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the united states 

 

airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations for example the united states department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the united states postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry as discussed below are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

 

fares and rates 

 

airlines set ticket prices in most domestic and international city pairs without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved many of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

 

route authority 

 

our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and to a limited extent by exemptions issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the united states and the foreign country or countries involved changes in united states or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the united states and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time 

 

certain of our international route and codesharing authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

 

airport access 

 

operations at three major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

 

 

in the united states the faa currently regulates slot allocations at reagan in washington dc and has imposed analogous regulatory mechanisms which restrict operations at o’hare international airport in chicago and laguardia in new york our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities we currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to do so in the future because among other reasons such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

 

environmental matters 

 

the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system this statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

 

the faa issued a final rule effective august 4 2005 adopting the international civil aviation organization’s “icao” chapter 4 noise standard which is known as the stage 4 standard in the united states this standard requires that all new commercial jet aircraft designs certificated on or after january 1 2006 be at least ten decibels quieter than the existing stage 3 noise standard requires this new standard does not apply to existing aircraft or to the continued production of aircraft types already certificated all new aircraft that we have on order will meet the proposed stage 4 standard accordingly the rule is not expected to have any significant impact on us 

 

the us environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions our aircraft comply with the applicable epa standards on november 17 2005 the epa issued a final rule adopting emissions control standards for aircraft engines previously adopted by the icao these standards apply to newly designed engines certified after december 31 2003 and align the us aircraft engine emission standards with existing international standards the rule as adopted is not expected to have a material impact on us however a group of state and local air regulators has filed a petition for review in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit challenging the rule on a number of grounds we are monitoring these proceedings 

 

in december 2004 miamidade county filed a lawsuit in florida circuit court against us seeking injunctive relief and alleging responsibility for past and future environmental cleanup costs and civil penalties for environmental conditions at miami international airport this lawsuit is related to several other actions filed by the county against other parties to recover environmental remediation costs incurred at the airport this lawsuit is currently stayed as a result of our chapter 11 proceedings and we anticipate settling this lawsuit through the bankruptcy process although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites we anticipate that many of the environmental liabilities at superfund sites and former leaseholds will be resolved through the bankruptcy proceedings although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

civil reserve air fleet program 

 

we participate in the civil reserve air fleet program the “craf program” which permits the united states military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program a portion of our international range aircraft from october 1 2006 until september 30 2007 as of october 1 2006 the following numbers of our international range aircraft are available for craf activation 

 

 

 

 

the craf program has only been activated twice both times at the stage i level since it was created in 1951 

 

regulatory and legislative proposals 

 

a number of congressional bills and proposed dot regulations have been considered in recent years to address airline competition and other issues some of these proposals would require large airlines with major operations at certain airports to divest or make available to other airlines slots gates facilities and other assets at those airports other measures would limit the service or pricing responses of major carriers that appear to target new entrant airlines in addition concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the dot and faa to consider various proposals for access to certain airports including “congestionbased” landing fees and programs that would withdraw slots from existing carriers and reallocate those slots either by lottery or auction to the highest bidder to carriers with little or no current presence at such airports these proposals if enacted could negatively impact our existing services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines furthermore recent events related to extreme weather delays may cause the dot to consider proposals related to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions 

 

employee matters 

 

railway   labor   act 

 

our relations with labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board the “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class under the nmb’s usual rules a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of those employees vote for union representation a certified labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer 

 

under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request that the nmb appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the president of the united states appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

 

 

collective bargaining 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had a total of approximately 51300 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 17 of these employees are represented by unions the following table presents certain information concerning the union representation of our active domestic employees 

 

 

 

 

labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of employees of delta and comair that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes the timing and outcome of these organizing efforts cannot presently be determined 

 

for additional information about our collective bargaining agreements see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

additional information   

 

we make available free of charge on our website our annual report on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q our current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission information on our website is not incorporated into this form 10k or our other securities filings and is not a part of those filings 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

risk factors relating   to   delta 

 

we filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code on september 14 2005 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with chapter 11 proceedings 

 

for the duration of our chapter 11 proceedings our operations including our ability to execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy risks and uncertainties associated with our chapter 11 proceedings include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways for example negative events or publicity associated with our chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our sales of tickets and the relationship with our customers as well as with vendors and employees which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition particularly if the chapter 11 proceedings are unexpectedly protracted also transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the bankruptcy court which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities 

 

because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our chapter 11 proceedings the ultimate impact that events that occur during these proceedings will have on our business financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified 

 

our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel continued periods of historically high fuel costs will continue to materially adversely affect our operating results likewise significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results 

 

our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel fuel prices increased substantially in 2004 2005 and 2006 in 2006 our average fuel price per gallon rose 19 to 204 as compared to an average price of 171 in 2005 which was 47 higher than our average price of 116 in 2004 in 2003 our average fuel price per gallon was 8178¢ the fuel costs represented 25 23 and 16 of our operating expenses in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively these increasing costs have had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited by the competitive nature of the airline industry we often have not been able to increase our fares to fully offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future 

 

 

in addition our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price to attempt to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices we periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which are comprised of heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts  though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure depending on the type of hedging instrument used our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be limited 

 

we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel weatherrelated events natural disasters political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us 

 

our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 

 

we will have substantial indebtedness even if our plan is consummated our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example our substantial indebtedness could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition  a substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes we have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business these liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions industry trends performance and many other factors not within our control substantial indebtedness along with other factors will limit our ability to obtain financing to meet such liquidity needs 

 

our exit financing credit facility will include financial and other covenants that will impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 

 

as part of the plan we expect to enter into an exit financing credit facility with various lenders from whom we have received commitments this credit facility will contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio minimum unrestricted cash reserves and minimum collateral coverage ratios in addition our exit financing credit facility will restrict our ability to among other things incur additional secured indebtedness make investments sell assets if not in compliance with coverage ratio tests pay dividends or repurchase stock these covenants may have a material impact on our operations in addition if we fail to comply with the covenants in the exit financing credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result under the exit financing credit facility 

 

the exit financing credit facility is also expected to contain other events of default customary for financings of this type including cross defaults to certain other indebtedness and certain change of control events if an event of default were to occur the lenders could declare outstanding borrowings under these agreements immediately due and payable we cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance borrowings under the exit financing credit facility if accelerated upon an event of default in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under the exit financing credit facility could also result in an event of default under other indebtedness 

 

 

the closing and funding of the exit financing credit facility is subject to the completion of definitive documentation and other conditions 

 

employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

 

our business is labor intensive utilizing large numbers of pilots flight attendants and other personnel approximately 18 of our workforce is unionized strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date the railway labor act generally prohibits strikes or other types of selfhelp actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the railway labor act have been exhausted 

 

in addition if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized they may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act and the bankruptcy code see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about comair’s negotiations with its work groups likewise if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages subject to the requirements of the railway labor act which could have a negative impact on our operations 

 

interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in cincinnati jfk and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at the atlanta airport or at one of the company’s other hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

 

we have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made significant investments in deltacom checkin kiosks “delta direct” phone banks and related initiatives the performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver these expected benefits if we are unable to make these investments our business and operations could be negatively affected 

 

in addition any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs like all companies our technology systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business 

 

 

if we experience further losses of senior management and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected and we may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 

 

we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans our financial performance along with our chapter 11 proceedings created uncertainty that led to a significant increase in unwanted attrition although unwanted attrition has slowed we remain at risk of losing additional management talent critical to the successful transformation and ongoing operation of our business if we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees our performance could be materially adversely impacted furthermore we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

 

we are facing significant litigation and if any such significant litigation is concluded in a manner adverse to us our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

 

we are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business as a result of our chapter 11 filing most attempts to collect secure or enforce remedies with respect to prepetition claims against the company are subject to the automatic stay provisions of section 362a of the bankruptcy code and certain liabilities could be discharged in the chapter 11 proceedings while we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain of our legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify damages being sought if the outcome of any significant litigation is adverse to the company and such proceedings are not discharged in the chapter 11 proceedings our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

 

we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

 

an aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability the insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate in the event that the insurance is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business for a description of the comair flight 5191 accident see “legal proceedings  comair flight 5191” in item 3 

 

any “ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses carryforwards 

 

under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code” a corporation is generally allowed a deduction in any taxable year for net operating losses carried over from prior years as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 78 billion of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 

 

a corporation’s use of its net operating loss carryforwards is generally limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” when an “ownership change” occurs pursuant to the implementation of a plan of reorganization under the bankruptcy code the general limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code may not apply if certain requirements are satisfied under either section 382l5 or section 382l6 of the internal revenue code we will experience an “ownership change” in connection with the plan but we have not yet determined whether we will be eligible for or rely on the special rule under section 382l5 or the special rule under section 382l6 assuming we rely on section 382l5 of the internal revenue code a second “ownership change” within two years from the effective date of the plan would eliminate completely our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers regardless of whether we rely on section 382l5 of the internal revenue code an “ownership change” after the effective date of the plan could significantly limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards for taxable years including or following such “ownership change” 

 

 

transfer restrictions on our stock issued in connection with the plan may limit the liquidity of our stock 

 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers our new certificate of incorporation will contain certain restrictions on the transfer of our stock issued in connection with the plan these transfer restrictions will be effective for two years following the effective date of the plan subject to extension for an additional three years these transfer restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our stock to dispose of or acquire shares of our stock during the period the restrictions are in place furthermore while the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an “ownership change” from occurring within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur 

 

risk factors relating to the airline industry 

 

the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us in particular we face significant competition at our hub airports in atlanta and jfk from other carriers in addition our operations at our hub airports also compete with operations at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs for example our hubs in atlanta jfk cincinnati and salt lake city compete with among others us airways’ hubs in charlotte philadelphia pittsburgh and phoenix respectively we also face increasing competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from rapidly expanding regional jet operators in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets 

 

the continuing growth of lowcost carriers including southwest airtran and jetblue in the united states has placed significant competitive pressure on us and other network carriers in addition other hubandspoke carriers such as us airways and united airlines reduced their costs through chapter 11 reorganizations our ability to compete effectively with lowcost carriers restructured carriers and other airlines depends in part on our ability to maintain a cost structure that is competitive with those carriers if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

 

the airline industry has changed fundamentally since the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and our business financial condition and operating results have been materially adversely affected 

 

since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the airline industry has experienced fundamental and permanent changes including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which have resulted in industrywide liquidity issues the terrorist attacks significantly reduced the demand for air travel and additional terrorist activity involving the airline industry could have an equal or greater impact additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry negatively affect us and the airline industry although global economic conditions have improved from their depressed levels after september 11 2001 the airline industry in the united states experienced a prolonged reduction in business travel and increased price sensitivity in customers’ purchasing behavior in addition aircraft fuel prices have increased significantly during the last several years were at historically high levels for an extended period during 2005 and remained at or near those levels during 2006 industry capacity has remained high despite these conditions we expect that all of these conditions will persist 

 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations 

 

 

other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues for example the aviation and transportation security act which became law in november 2001 mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax due to the weak revenue environment the existing tax has negatively impacted our revenues because we have generally not been able to increase our fares to pass these fees on to our customers similarly the proposed ticket tax increase if implemented could negatively impact our revenues 

 

furthermore we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

 

our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the coverage currently extends through august 31 2007 the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially if available such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all resulting in an interruption to our operations

flight equipment 

 

our active aircraft fleet at december 31 2006 is summarized in the following table 

 

 

our purchase commitments firm orders for aircraft as well as options to purchase additional aircraft as of december 31 2006 are shown in the tables below 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground facilities 

 

we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases we own a portion of our principal offices our atlanta reservations center and other real property in atlanta 

 

we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve at most airports that we serve we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other improvements and facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft these leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to thirty years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement examples of major leases and use agreements at delta hub or other significant airports that will expire in the next several years include among others 1 atlanta central passenger terminal lease and the airport use agreement which expire in 2010 2 salt lake city airport use and lease agreement which expires in 2008 and 3 laguardia terminal lease which expires in 2008 we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports including among others our main atlanta maintenance base atlanta air cargo facilities and hangar and air cargo facilities at the cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport and salt lake city international airport our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities including in some cases amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction we also lease marketing ticket and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms additional information relating to our leases of our ground facilities is set forth in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

 

the city of atlanta with our support and the support of other airlines is currently implementing portions of a ten year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport implementation of the cip should increase the number of flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays the cip includes among other things a new approximately 9000 foot fullservice runway that opened in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements if fully implemented the cip is currently estimated by the city of atlanta to cost approximately 68 billion which exceeds the 54 billion cip approved by the airlines in 1999 the cip runs through 2010 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds certain elements of the cip have been delayed and there is no assurance that the cip will be fully implemented failure to implement certain portions of the cip in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at the atlanta airport

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

 

background 

 

on september 14 2005 the “petition date” we and substantially all of our subsidiaries collectively the “debtors” filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the “bankruptcy code” in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the “bankruptcy court” the reorganization cases are being jointly administered under the caption “in re delta air lines inc et al case no 0517923ash” 

 

the debtors are operating as “debtorsinpossession” under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code in general as debtorsinpossession the debtors are authorized under chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the bankruptcy court 

 

under section 365 and other relevant sections of the bankruptcy code we may assume assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases including leases of real property aircraft and aircraft engines subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court and certain other conditions any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease in this form 10k including where applicable our express termination rights or a quantification of our obligations must be read in conjunction with and is qualified by any overriding rejection rights we have under the bankruptcy code 

 

on december 19 2006 we filed with the bankruptcy court our plan of reorganization and a related disclosure statement which contemplate that delta will emerge from chapter 11 as an independent airline the plan of reorganization as amended the “plan” addresses various subjects with respect to the debtors including the resolution of prepetition obligations as well as the capital structure and corporate governance after exit from chapter 11 

 

the plan provides that most holders of allowed unsecured claims against the debtors will receive common stock of reorganized delta in satisfaction of their claims some holders of allowed unsecured claims against the debtors would have the right to request cash proceeds of sales of common stock of reorganized delta in lieu of such stock and certain others would receive cash in satisfaction of their claims current holders of delta’s equity interests would not receive any distributions and their equity interests would be cancelled once the plan becomes effective 

 

on february 7 2007 the bankruptcy court approved the amended disclosure statement and authorized the debtors to begin soliciting votes from creditors to approve the plan the official committee of unsecured creditors the “creditors committee” and the two official retiree committees appointed in the debtors’ chapter 11 proceedings each support the plan to be accepted by holders of claims against the debtors the plan must be approved by at least onehalf in number and twothirds in dollar amount of claims actually voting in each impaired class 

 

april 9 2007 is the deadline for creditors to vote on the plan the bankruptcy court has scheduled a confirmation hearing on april 25 2007 to consider approval of the plan if the plan is approved by the creditors and confirmed by the bankruptcy court the debtors are planning to emerge from chapter 11 shortly thereafter

overview of 2006 results 

 

in 2006 we recorded a net loss of 62 billion which is primarily attributable to a 62 billion charge to reorganization items net our 2006 financial results also include a 765 million income tax benefit associated with the reversal of certain income tax valuation allowances and a 310 million noncash charge associated with certain accounting adjustments for additional information about these matters see “results of operations  2006 compared to 2005” and “basis of presentation of consolidated financial statements  accounting adjustments” below 

 

 

from an operational perspective we reported operating income of 58 million in 2006 a 21 billion improvement in operating results compared to 2005 and our first annual operating profit since 2000 this improvement is due in large part to revenue increases and cost reductions we have achieved during our chapter 11 reorganization from revenue and network productivity improvements incourt restructuring initiatives and labor cost reductions 

 

during 2006 we also strengthened our liquidity cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 26 billion at december 31 2006 compared to 20 billion at december 31 2005 

 

our business plan 

 

our reorganization in chapter 11 has involved a fundamental transformation of our business shortly after the petition date we outlined a business plan intended to make delta a simpler more efficient and more customer focused airline with an improved financial condition 

 

restructuring business plan 

 

as part of the chapter 11 reorganization process we were seeking 30 billion in annual financial improvements by the end of 2007 as of december 31 2006 we reached that goal and these improvements are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for 2006 we expect we will achieve additional financial improvements in 2007 the 30 billion in annual financial improvements under our restructuring business plan is a result of 1 revenue and network productivity improvements 2 incourt restructuring initiatives and 3 labor cost reductions some of our accomplishments in these areas are described below 

 

revenue and network productivity improvements key initiatives accomplished by the end of 2006 in the area of revenue and network productivity improvements include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we strengthened our domestic hubs and are continuing to increase international service for example in 2006 we added more than 50 new daily flights to 20 cities in 18 countries in europe and other countries such as india and israel capitalizing on our international gateways at hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport which is the world’s largest hub and john f kennedy international airport in new york in addition we offer more than 600 weekly flights to 58 destinations in latin america and the caribbean 

 

incourt restructuring initiatives our business plan includes annual cost reductions through incourt initiatives such as debt restructurings lease and facility restructurings aircraft lease renegotiations and rejections vendor contract renegotiations and retiree healthcare benefit modifications some of our accomplishments through the end of 2006 include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

labor cost reductions our business plan includes annual benefits through reduced employment costs during our chapter 11 proceedings by the end of 2006 we had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emergence business plan 

 

as a result of our reorganization we expect to emerge from bankruptcy as a competitive standalone airline with a global network we intend to be the airline of choice for customers by continuing to improve the customer experience on the ground and in the air our business strategy touches all facets of our operations  the destinations we will serve the way we will serve our customers and the fleet we will operate  in order to earn customer preference and continue to improve revenue performance at the same time we intend to remain focused on maintaining the competitive cost structure we have obtained from our reorganization to improve our financial position and pursue longterm stability as a standalone carrier 

 

important aspects of our emergence business strategy include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unsolicited merger proposal 

 

on november 15 2006 us airways group inc “us airways” publicly announced an unsolicited proposal to engage in a merger transaction with us the “us airways proposal” 

 

under the original us airways proposal the holders of unsecured claims in our bankruptcy cases would have received 40 billion in cash and 785 million shares of us airways common stock in addition us airways contemplated that our debtorinpossession financing agreements and all other allowed secured claims and administrative claims in our bankruptcy cases would be assumed or paid in full the us airways proposal was conditioned on satisfactory completion of a due diligence investigation on us the bankruptcy court’s approval of a mutually agreeable plan of reorganization predicated upon a merger regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of us airways 

 

on december 15 2006 our board of directors unanimously determined that the us airways proposal was inadequate presented unacceptably high risk that it could not be consummated in the manner suggested by us airways was not in our best interests or in the best interests of our creditors as well as our other stakeholders and rejected the us airways proposal the board of directors also determined that our interest and that of our creditors would be best served if we proceeded with filing the plan together with the disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court this decision by our board of directors was made after careful consideration and extensive review and consultation with its legal and financial advisors 

 

on january 10 2007 us airways increased its offer to merge with us and set forth a revised proposal the “revised us airways proposal” under which the holders of our unsecured claims would have received 50 billion in cash and 895 million shares of us airways common stock us airways said that the revised us airways proposal would expire on february 1 2007 unless prior to that date there was affirmative creditor support for the commencement of due diligence the required filings under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act had been made and the hearing on the disclosure statement scheduled for february 7 2007 had been adjourned 

 

on january 31 2007 the creditors committee announced support for our standalone plan of reorganization the creditors committee said that it had considered various factors including the risks associated with and the likelihood of a successful consummation of the revised us airways proposal and the plan in reaching its conclusion in favor of the standalone plan of reorganization following this announcement us airways withdrew its proposal 

 

basis of presentation of consolidated financial statements 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” including the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position 907 “financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code” “sop 907” this contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business accordingly our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 

 

 

due to our chapter 11 proceedings the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities without substantial adjustments andor changes in ownership are subject to uncertainty accordingly there is substantial doubt about the current financial reporting entity’s ability to continue as a going concern upon emergence from bankruptcy we expect to adopt fresh start reporting in accordance with sop 907 which will result in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes the adoption of fresh start reporting may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the new financial reporting entity 

 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect or provide for the consequences of the chapter 11 proceedings in particular the financial statements do not show 1 as to assets their realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities 2 as to prepetition liabilities the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies or their status and priority 3 as to shareowners’ equity accounts the effect of any changes that may be made in our capitalization or 4 as to operations the effect of any changes that may be made in our business 

 

sale of asa 

 

on september 7 2005 we sold atlantic southeast airlines inc “asa” our wholly owned subsidiary to skywest inc “skywest” after the sale the revenue and expenses related to our contract carrier agreement with asa are reported as regional affiliates passenger revenues and contract carrier arrangements respectively in our consolidated statements of operations prior to the sale expenses related to asa were reported in the applicable expense line item in our consolidated statements of operations see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on the sale of asa 

 

accounting adjustments 

 

during 2006 we recorded certain outofperiod adjustments “accounting adjustments” in our consolidated financial statements that are reflected in our results for the year ended december 31 2006 these adjustments resulted in an aggregate net noncash charge approximating 310 million to our consolidated statement of operations consisting primarily of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe the accounting adjustments considered individually and in the aggregate are not material to our consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 in making this assessment we considered qualitative and quantitative factors including the substantial net loss in each of these three years the noncash nature of the accounting adjustments our substantial shareowners’ deficit at the end of each of these three years and our status as a debtorinpossession under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 

 

 

results of operations — 2006 compared to 2005 

 

net loss 

 

our consolidated net loss was 62 billion in 2006 and 38 billion in 2005 the net loss for 2006 includes 1 a 62 billion charge to reorganization items net see “reorganization items net” below” 2 310 million of noncash charges associated with certain accounting adjustments see “accounting adjustments” above and 3 a 765 million income tax benefit see “income tax benefit” below as discussed below the net loss for 2005 includes an 888 million charge to restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net and an 884 million charge to reorganization items net 

 

operating revenue 

 

 

 

operating revenue totaled 172 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 a 980 million or 6 increase compared to the year ended december 31 2005 passenger revenue increased 7 while capacity decreased 6 the increase in passenger revenue is due to a rise of 10 and 13 in passenger mile yield and passenger revenue per available seat mile “passenger rasm” respectively from fare increases that reflect strong passenger demand as well as actions we have taken since our chapter 11 filing to achieve revenue and network productivity improvements passenger revenue and other net revenue were negatively impacted by certain accounting adjustments discussed above passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to 1 a change in how we classify asa’s revenues as a result of its sale to skywest and 2 new contract carrier agreements with shuttle america corporation “shuttle america” and freedom airlines inc “freedom” effective september 1 2005 and october 1 2005 respectively 

 

 

 

north american passenger revenue north american passenger revenue increased 2 driven by a 14 increase in passenger mile yield and a 28 point increase in load factor which were partially offset by a 13 decline in capacity passenger rasm increased 18 the decline in capacity partially offset by the increase in load factor resulted in a 10 decline in revenue passenger miles “rpms” or traffic the increases in passenger revenue passenger mile yield and passenger rasm reflect 1 fare increases implemented as part of the improved industry revenue environment and 2 the positive impact of our strategic initiatives including rightsizing capacity to better meet customer demand and increasing pointtopoint flying and simplifying our domestic hubs to achieve a greater local traffic mix 

 

 

international passenger revenue international passenger revenue increased 24 generated by a 20 increase in rpms from a 21 increase in capacity the passenger mile yield and passenger rasm increased 3 and 2 respectively these results reflect increases in service to international destinations primarily in the atlantic and latin america markets from the restructuring of our route network 

 

operating expense 

 

 

operating expense was 171 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 a 11 billion or 6 decrease compared to the year ended december 31 2005 as discussed below the decrease in operating expense was primarily due to a decrease in 2006 in 1 salaries and related costs 2 charges related to restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net 3 aircraft rent and 4 other expenses these decreases were partially offset by 1 higher contract carrier arrangements expense primarily due to a change in how we classify asa expense as a result of our sale of asa on september 7 2005 2 certain accounting adjustments discussed above and 3 an increase in aircraft fuel prices 

 

operating capacity decreased 6 to 148 billion available seat miles primarily due to the reduction of our aircraft fleet as part of our business plan initiatives operating cost per available seat mile decreased less than 1 to 1156¢ because the decrease in total operating expense discussed above was offset by the reduction in operating capacity 

 

aircraft fuel aircraft fuel expense increased due to higher fuel prices despite reduced consumption our average fuel price per gallon increased 19 to 204 fuel gallons consumed decreased 15 due to a reduction in mainline capacity and our sale of asa as a result of this sale asa’s fuel gallons are no longer part of our fuel gallons consumed aircraft fuel expense includes fuel hedge losses of 108 million in 2006 

 

salaries and related costs the decrease in salaries and related costs primarily reflects a 12 decline due to lower mainline headcount and our sale of asa and a 9 decrease from salary rate and benefit cost reductions for our pilot and nonpilot employees partially offset by certain accounting adjustments discussed above 

 

contract carrier arrangements contract carrier arrangements expense increased primarily due to 1 a 73 increase from the change in how we classify asa’s expenses as a result of its sale to skywest and 2 an 18 increase from new contract carrier agreements with shuttle america and freedom 

 

landing fees and other rents landing fees and other rents remained relatively constant because 1 a 4 decrease from the change in how we classify asa’s expenses as a result of its sale to skywest and 2 a net 4 decrease due to our shifting of capacity from domestic to international were offset by certain accounting adjustments discussed above 

 

 

aircraft rent the decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to a 29 decrease from the renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our restructuring efforts and an 8 decrease from the change in how we classify asa’s expenses as a result of its sale to skywest 

 

restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net for 2006 restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net totaled a 13 million charge primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

for 2005 restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net totaled an 888 million charge consisting of the following 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

other the decrease in other operating expense primarily reflects 1 a 12 decrease due to an adjustment related to certain nonincome tax reserves 2 a 10 decrease from certain accounting adjustments discussed above and 3 an 8 decrease related to the change in how we classify asa’s expenses as a result of its sale to skywest 

 

operating income loss and operating margin 

 

we reported operating income of 58 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to an operating loss of 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 operating margin which is the ratio of operating income loss to operating revenues was less than 1 and 12 for 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

other expense income 

 

other expense net for 2006 was 820 million compared to 974 million for 2005 this change is substantially attributable to a 16 or 162 million decrease in interest expense which was partially offset by a 19 million increase in miscellaneous net expense primarily associated with our fuel hedge positions 

 

the reduction in interest expense is primarily attributable to a 206 million decrease due to the accounting treatment of certain interest charges under our chapter 11 proceedings in accordance with sop 907 see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a 97 million increase from a higher level of debt outstanding and higher interest rates 

 

 

the increase in miscellaneous net expense is primarily due to charges related to the ineffective portion of our fuel hedge positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” for additional information about our fuel hedge positions see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

reorganization items net 

 

reorganization items net totaled a 62 billion charge for 2006 primarily consisting of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reorganization items net totaled an 884 million charge for 2005 primarily consisting of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income tax benefit 

 

for 2006 we recorded an income tax benefit totaling 765 million the amount primarily reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the derecognition of previously recorded pilot plan and pilot nonqualified plan obligations upon each plan’s termination 

 

for 2005 we recorded an income tax benefit totaling 41 million the amount is primarily the result of a 16 billion adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to increases in the deferred tax asset related to our additional minimum pension liability and net operating loss carryforwards 

 

for additional information about the income tax valuation allowance see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

operating revenue totaled 162 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 a 956 million or 6 increase compared to the year ended december 31 2004 passenger revenue increased 6 on a 3 increase in capacity the increase in passenger revenue reflects a 6 rise in rpms and a flat passenger mile yield the relatively constant passenger mile yield reflects our lack of pricing power due to the continuing growth of lowcost carriers with which we compete in most of our domestic markets high industry capacity and price sensitivity by our customers enhanced by the availability of airline fare information on the internet during the fourth quarter of 2005 passenger mile yield increased 8 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 which reflects a general improvement in the overall business environment and the structural changes we made to strengthen our route network since our chapter 11 filing 

 

 

north american passenger revenue north american passenger revenue increased 4 due to increased traffic in 2005 in the first half of 2005 yields averaged 5 below the first half of 2004 while in the second half of 2005 yields averaged 5 higher than the second half of 2004 

 

international passenger revenue higher international passenger revenue reflects a capacity increase of 13 rpms also increased 13 while passenger mile yield increased 4 passenger rasm increased 4 to 845¢ and load factor remained consistent with the prior year these increases reflect increases in service to international destinations primarily in transatlantic markets 

 

 

operating expense 

 

 

 

operating expense for 2005 was 182 billion which includes an 888 million charge for restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net operating expense for 2004 totaled 185 billion which includes a 19 billion impairment of intangible assets related to the writeoff of goodwill associated with asa and comair for additional information about this charge see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

operating capacity for 2005 increased 3 to 157 billion available seat miles primarily due to operational efficiencies from the redesign of our atlanta hub from a banked to a continuous hub which allowed us to increase systemwide capacity with no additional mainline aircraft operating cost per available seat mile decreased 5 to 1160¢ 

 

salaries and related costs the decrease in salaries and related costs includes a 17 decrease from salary rate reductions for our pilot and nonpilot employees and a 7 decline due to lower headcount 

 

aircraft fuel aircraft fuel expense increased 13 billion or 46 driven by higher fuel prices which were slightly offset by a reduction in total gallons consumed due to our sale of asa to skywest on september 7 2005 our average fuel price per gallon increased 47 to 171 while total gallons consumed decreased 1 fare increases implemented during 2005 in response to rising aircraft fuel prices offset only a small portion of those cost increases during 2005 we had no significant hedges or contractual arrangements to reduce our fuel costs below market levels our fuel expense is shown net of fuel hedge gains of 105 million in 2004 

 

contract carrier arrangements contract carrier arrangements expense increased primarily due to 1 a change in how we account for asa’s expenses as a result of its sale to skywest and 2 new contract carrier agreements with shuttle america and freedom these increases were partially offset by the termination of our contract carrier arrangement with flyi inc in 2004 

 

aircraft rent the decrease in aircraft rent expense largely reflects a 21 decrease due to our lease restructuring in the december 2004 quarter which resulted in the reclassification of certain aircraft leases from operating to capital as discussed below this reclassification increased our interest expense the reduction in aircraft rent expense also reflects our rejection of the leases for 50 aircraft the renegotiation of the leases for seven aircraft and the repossession of 15 aircraft in connection with our chapter 11 proceedings during 2005 

 

restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net for 2005 restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net totaled an 888 million charge consisting of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for 2004 restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net totaled a 41 million gain consisting of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other the increase in other operating expense primarily reflects a 13 rise due to the increase of incremental costs associated with our skymiles frequent flyer program and a 5 increase from higher fuel taxes these increases were partially offset by the impact of our sale of asa for additional information regarding our skymiles frequent flyer program see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

other expense income 

 

other expenses net for 2005 increased 42 to 974 million compared to 684 million for 2004 this change is substantially attributable to a 25 or 208 million increase in interest expense in 2005 and a gain from sale of investments which we recognized in 2004 

 

interest expense increased primarily due to a 31 increase from higher levels of debt outstanding and higher interest rates as well as a 10 rise due to additional interest related to the reclassification of certain aircraft leases from operating leases to capital leases as a result of renegotiations during the december 2004 quarter see discussion of aircraft rent expense above these increases were offset by a 15 decrease due to the accounting treatment of certain interest charges under our chapter 11 proceedings in accordance with sop 907 

 

gain from sale of investments was 123 million for 2004 primarily due to the sale of our remaining equity interest in orbitz inc for additional information about this sale see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

reorganization items net 

 

reorganization items net totaled an 884 million charge for 2005 see “results of operations  2006 compared to 2005” for additional information on these items 

 

income tax benefit provision 

 

in 2004 we recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because we determined it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize the benefit of those tax assets in 2005 we increased our valuation allowance by approximately 16 billion for additional information about the income tax valuation allowance see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

financial condition and liquidity 

 

during our chapter 11 proceedings we entered into a number of agreements related to financing arrangements and settlements of prepetition claims for a description of the arrangements that had an effect on our liquidity see notes 6 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

on january 30 2007 we secured commitments for a 25 billion exit financing facility “exit facility” to be used in connection with our plan to exit bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2007 for further information about the exit facility see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we have obligations under our agreement with alpa and the pbgc settlement agreement to issue an aggregate of 875 million of new unsecured notes for further information about our agreement with alpa and the pbgc settlement agreement see notes 1 and 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

our amended and restated dip credit facility and the amex postpetition facility include certain affirmative negative and financial covenants we were in compliance with these covenant requirements at december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

we expect to meet our cash needs for 2007 from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and financing arrangements as discussed in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have obtained commitments for a 25 billion exit facility in connection with our plan to exit bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2007 

 

our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 26 billion at december 31 2006 compared to 20 billion at december 31 2005 restricted cash totaled 802 million and 928 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2006 and 2005 include 156 million and 155 million respectively which is set aside for the payment of certain operational taxes and fees to various governmental authorities 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 993 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of 13 billion and 20 billion compared to the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively cash provided by operating activities in 2006 reflects an increase of 401 million and 20 billion in working capital compared to 2005 and 2004 respectively these increases are primarily a result of revenue and network productivity improvements incourt restructuring initiatives and labor cost reductions implemented in connection with our restructuring business plan during our chapter 11 proceedings and an improved revenue environment for additional information regarding our restructuring business plan and operational performance see “our business plan” “results of operations  2006 compared to 2005” and “results of operations — 2005 compared to 2004 ” respectively 

our 2006 cash flows from operating activities also includes a 116 million decrease in our restricted cash balance primarily due to a release of cash from restricted to operating as a result of agreements we reached with certain vendors in 2005 our restricted cash balance increased significantly primarily due to cash holdbacks associated with our visamastercard credit card processing agreement for the year ended december 31 2006 we classified changes to our restricted cash balances primarily associated with credit card holdbacks to cash flows from operating activities to better reflect the nature of restricted cash activities prior to 2006 we presented such changes as an investing activity for additional information regarding this reclassification see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

cash used in investing activities totaled 361 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 22 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this change reflects a 401 million decrease in cash used for the purchase of flight and ground equipment in 2006 our 2005 cash flows from investing activities also includes 842 million in proceeds from our sale of asa and certain flight equipment 

 

cash provided by investing activities totaled 22 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to cash used in investing activities of 320 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this change reflects 570 million of flight equipment additions in 2005 including 417 million we paid to purchase 11 b737800 aircraft that we sold to a third party immediately after these aircraft were delivered to us by the manufacturer our 2005 cash flows from investing activities also include 842 million in proceeds from our sale of asa and certain flight equipment discussed above 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

cash used in financing activities totaled 606 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 830 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this change is primarily due to the net proceeds we received under our secured superpriority debtorinpossession credit agreement the “dip credit facility” shortly after our chapter 11 filing in 2005 as a result of our chapter 11 filing we ceased making payments on our unsecured debt for additional information regarding our chapter 11 proceedings and longterm debt see notes 1 and 6 respectively of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

cash provided by financing activities totaled 830 million and 636 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively this change is primarily attributable to the net proceeds we received under our dip credit facility as discussed above compared to the net proceeds we received in 2004 in connection with newly entered or amended financing arrangements in the aggregate amount of 18 billion and the issuance of 2 ⅞  convertible senior notes due 2024 in the amount of 325 million as discussed above after filing for bankruptcy we ceased making payments on our unsecured debt 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 that relate to debt operating leases aircraft order commitments capital leases contract carrier obligations other material noncancelable purchase obligations and other liabilities we are in the process of evaluating our executory contracts in order to determine which contracts will be assumed in our chapter 11 proceedings therefore obligations as currently quantified in the table below and in the text immediately following the footnotes to the table will continue to change the table below does not include contracts that we have successfully rejected through our chapter 11 proceedings the table also does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under our settlement agreement with the pbgc relating to the termination of the pilot plan we are required to issue to the pbgc no later than seven business days after our emergence from bankruptcy senior unsecured notes “pbgc notes” with an aggregate principal amount of 225 million a term of up to 15 years and an annual interest rate calculated to ensure the pbgc notes trade at par on the issuance date we may replace all or a portion of the principal amount of the pbgc notes with cash prior to their issuance which we are required to do under certain circumstances 

 

the pilot notes and the pbgc notes are not included in the table above 

 

 

 

 

 

we have signed a letter of intent with a third party to lease 10 b757200er aircraft these aircraft will be delivered from july 2007 through november 2007 and will be leased for seven years and three months each we have also signed a letter of intent with a separate third party to lease three b757200er aircraft which would be delivered to us in the first quarter of 2008 or such earlier dates as the parties may agree and will be leased for five years these aircraft leases are not included in the table above 

 

 

 

 

 

on january 31 2007 we entered into an agreement to acquire 30 crj900 aircraft from bombardier inc with options to acquire an additional 30 crj900 aircraft the aircraft will be delivered in twoclass 76 seat configuration between september 2007 and february 2010 we expect these aircraft will be operated by regional air carriers under contract carrier agreements and the purchase agreement permits assignment of the aircraft and related support provisions to other carriers we have available to us longterm secured financing commitments to fund a substantial portion of the aircraft purchase price for the 30 firm orders these aircraft order commitments are not included in the table above 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following items are not included in the table above 

 

pension plans we sponsor qualified defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions including those described below 

 

defined contribution pension plans “dc plans” during the year ended december 31 2006 we contributed approximately 110 million to our dc plans estimates of future funding requirements under our dc plans are not reasonably estimable at this time under our comprehensive agreement with alpa reducing our pilot labor costs alpa received among other things a 21 billion allowed general unsecured prepetition claim in our bankruptcy proceedings the proceeds of this claim will be distributed to pilot accounts under the delta familycare savings plan to the extent permitted by the internal revenue code thereby reducing the amount we can contribute under the internal revenue code to the dc plan for pilots in 2007 in addition we intend to implement changes to our dc plan for nonpilot employees following our exit from bankruptcy but the design of these plan changes has not yet been finalized 

 

defined benefit pension plans “db plans”  during the year ended december 31 2006 we contributed approximately 4 million to our db plans under our settlement agreement with the pbgc the pilot plan was terminated effective september 2 2006 and we agreed to initiate prior to our emergence from chapter 11 a standard termination of a separate frozen qualified defined benefit pension plan for certain pilots formerly employed by western air lines in addition our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for pilots were terminated effective september 2 2006 

 

effective december 31 2005 future pay and service accruals under the nonpilot plan were frozen the pension preservation act of 2006 allows us to reduce the funding obligations for the nonpilot plan over the next several years as a result of this legislation we intend to maintain the nonpilot plan while this legislation makes our funding obligations for the nonpilot plan more predictable factors outside our control will continue to have an impact on the funding requirements for that plan 

 

estimates of future funding requirements for the nonpilot plan are based on various assumptions including legislative changes regarding these obligations these assumptions also include among other things the actual and projected market performance of assets of the nonpilot plan statutory requirements the terms of the nonpilot plan and demographic data for participants in the nonpilot plan including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition 

 

assuming current funding rules and current plan design we estimate that the funding requirements under the nonpilot plan for 2007 2008 and 2009 will aggregate approximately 300 million 

 

contract carriers we have longterm contract carrier agreements with the following five regional air carriers in addition to comair chautauqua shuttle america asa skywest airlines and freedom under these agreements the carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight code and we schedule those aircraft sell the seats on those flights and retain the related revenues we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services 

 

under these longterm contract carrier agreements we are obligated to pay certain minimum fixed obligations which are included in the table above the remaining estimated expenses are not included in the table because these expenses are contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier flights by those air carriers as well as rates that are unknown at this time we cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expenses under the contract carrier agreements in 2007 and thereafter 

 

we may terminate the chautauqua and shuttle america agreements without cause at any time after may 2010 and january 2013 respectively by providing certain advance notice if we terminate either the chautauqua or shuttle america agreements without cause chautauqua or shuttle america respectively has the right to 1 assign to us leased aircraft that the airline operates for us provided we are able to continue the leases on the same terms the airline had prior to the assignment and 2 require us to purchase or lease any of the aircraft that the airline owns and operates for us at the time of the termination if we are required to purchase aircraft owned by chautauqua or shuttle america the purchase price would be equal to the amount necessary to 1 reimburse chautauqua or shuttle america for the equity it provided to purchase the aircraft and 2 repay in full any debt outstanding at such time that is not being assumed in connection with such purchase if we are required to lease aircraft owned by chautauqua or shuttle america the lease would have 1 a rate equal to the debt payments of chautauqua or shuttle america for the debt financing of the aircraft calculated as if 90 of the aircraft was debt financed by chautauqua or shuttle america and 2 other specified terms and conditions 

 

we estimate that the total fair values determined as of december 31 2006 of the aircraft that chautauqua or shuttle america could assign to us or require that we purchase if we terminate without cause our contract carrier agreements with those airlines the “ put right ”  are 483 million and 367 million respectively the actual amount that we may be required to pay in these circumstances may be materially different from these estimates if the chautaqua or shuttle america put right is exercised we must also pay to the exercising carrier 10 interest compounded monthly on the equity the carrier provided when it purchased the put aircraft these equity amounts for chautauqua and shuttle america total 56 million and 34 million respectively 

 

for additional information on contract carrier agreements see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

interest and related payments estimated amounts for future interest and related payments in connection with our longterm debt obligations are based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements we expect to pay 643 million related to interest on our fixed and variable rate longterm debt not subject to compromise in 2007 estimates on variable rate interest were calculated using implied shortterm libor based on libor at december 31 2006 the related payments represent credit enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing agreements as a result of our chapter 11 filing actual interest expense in 2007 is expected to be less than the contractual interest expense see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about our policy relating to interest expense 

 

legal contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought as a result of our chapter 11 proceedings virtually all prepetition pending litigation against us is stayed and related amounts accrued have been classified in liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

other contingent obligations under contracts in addition to the contractual obligations discussed above we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment as defined by each respective contract if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs we also cannot predict the impact if any that our chapter 11 proceedings might have on these obligations 

 

for additional information about other contingencies not discussed above as well as discussions related to general indemnifications see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

 

claims resolution process as of february 7 2007 claims totaling about 870 billion have been filed with the bankruptcy court against the debtors and we expect new and amended claims to be filed in the future including claims amended to assign values to claims originally filed with no designated value we have identified and we expect to continue to identify many claims that we believe should be disallowed by the bankruptcy court because they are duplicative have been later amended or superseded are without merit are overstated or for other reasons as of february 7 2007 the bankruptcy court has disallowed approximately 12 billion of claims and has not yet ruled on our other objections to claims the disputed portions of which aggregate to an additional 28 billion we expect to continue to file objections in the future because the process of analyzing and objecting to claims is ongoing the amount of disallowed claims may increase significantly in the future 

 

through the claims resolution process differences in amounts scheduled by the debtors and claims filed by creditors will be investigated and resolved including through the filing of objections with the bankruptcy court where appropriate in light of the substantial number and amount of claims filed the claims resolution process may take considerable time to complete and we expect that it will continue after our emergence from chapter 11 accordingly the ultimate number and amount of allowed claims is not presently known nor is the exact recovery with respect to allowed claims presently known 

 

passenger revenue we record sales of passenger tickets as air traffic liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused reducing the related air traffic liability we periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and record any resulting adjustments in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the evaluations are completed these adjustments relate primarily to refunds exchanges transactions with other airlines and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price 

 

frequent flyer program we have a frequent flyer program the skymiles program offering incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows participants to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta connection carriers and participating airlines as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airlines for membership in our crown room club and for other program awards 

 

for skymiles accounts with sufficient mileage credits to qualify for a free travel award we record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards that are earned and expected to be redeemed for travel on delta or other airlines our incremental costs include our system average cost per passenger for fuel food and other direct passenger costs for awards to be redeemed on delta these estimates are generally updated based on our 12month historical average for such costs we also accrue a frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits that are expected to be used for travel on participating airlines based on historical usage patterns and contractual rates we periodically record adjustments to this liability in other operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations based on awards earned awards redeemed changes in our estimated incremental costs and changes to the skymiles program changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the liability in the year in which the change occurs and in future years the liability is recorded in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 we estimated that approximately eight million and seven million free travel awards respectively were expected to be redeemed for free travel on delta or other airlines this estimate excludes mileage credits in skymiles accounts which 1 do not have sufficient mileage credits to qualify for a free travel award or 2 have sufficient mileage credits to qualify for a free travel award but which are not expected to be redeemed for such an award 

 

we sell mileage credits in our skymiles frequent flyer program to participating companies such as credit card companies hotels and car rental agencies the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates the fair value of travel to be provided is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue over the period when transportation is expected to be provided amounts received in excess of the transportation’s fair value are recognized in income currently and classified as other revenue a change in assumptions as to the period over which the mileage credits are expected to be used currently 15 to 41 months the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate of the fair value of transportation expected to be provided could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years 

 

our total liability for future skymiles award redemptions for free travel on us or participating airlines as well as unrecognized revenue from selling skymiles mileage credits was approximately 887 million and 607 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these amounts were recorded as components of other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

longlived assets our flight equipment and other longlived assets have a recorded value of 130 billion on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2006 this value is based on various factors including the assets’ estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 

 

in order to evaluate potential impairment as required by sfas 144 we group assets at the fleet type level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available for additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of longlived assets see notes 2 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

income tax valuation allowance and contingencies in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things our deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment our historical earnings and losses our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and our outlook for future years 

 

our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest we review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations conclusion of tax audits a change in exposure based on current calculations identification of new issues release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

 

for additional information about income taxes see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

pension plans we sponsor db plans for our eligible employees and retirees the impact of these db plans on our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 and 2005 and for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 is presented in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements assuming current plan design we currently estimate that our defined benefit pension plan expense in 2007 will be approximately 100 million the effect of our db plans on our consolidated financial statements is subject to many assumptions we believe the most critical assumptions are 1 the weighted average discount rate and 2 the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans the pilot plan and pilot nonqualified defined benefit pension plans were terminated during 2006 for additional information regarding these terminations see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments we used a weighted average discount rate of 588 and 569 at september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively additionally our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date ranging from 609 in 2004 to 567 in 2006 due to remeasurements throughout the year the impact of a 050 change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on the assets of our db plans is based primarily on specific asset investment studies for our db plans performed by outside consultants who used historical returns on our db plans’ assets the investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios public and private fixed income portfolios and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a longterm investment return that meets or exceeds a 9 annualized return target our historical annualized tenyear rate of return on plan assets is approximately 9 as of december 31 2006 the impact of a 050 change in our expected longterm rate of return is shown in the table below 

 

 

 

our rate of change in future compensation levels is based primarily on labor contracts with our employees under collective bargaining agreements and expected future pay rate changes for other employees due to the freeze of benefit accruals effective december 31 2005 in our nonpilot plan adjusting the rate of change in future compensation levels does not have an impact on 2007 pension expense or on the accrued pension liability at december 31 2006 

 

for additional information about our pension plans see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of sfas nos 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” this statement among other things requires that we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2006 with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive loss in the year in which such changes occur application of this standard resulted in 1 a 685 million net decrease in accrued pension and other postretirement and postemployment liabilities 2 a 248 million decrease in the intangible pension asset in other noncurrent assets and 3 a 437 million decrease in shareowners’ deficit the adoption of sfas 158 had no effect on our consolidated statement of operations for any period presented for additional information related to the adoption of sfas 158 see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions as defined fin 48 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the cumulative effect of applying this interpretation must be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of shareowners’ deficit in 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of fin 48 on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate the adjustment to shareowners’ deficit will not be material 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires an entity to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of its share based payments such as stock options granted to employees this standard replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas 123” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” we adopted sfas 123r on january 1 2006 for additional information regarding sfas 123r see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statement

we have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under sfas 133 to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and shareowners’ deficit 

 

the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

 

aircraft fuel price risk 

 

our results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel to manage this risk we periodically enter into derivative contracts comprised of heating oil and jet fuel swap and collar contracts to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements we do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes 

 

in 2006 aircraft fuel expense accounted for 25 of our total operating expenses aircraft fuel expense for 2006 increased 1 compared to 2005 due to higher fuel prices despite reduced consumption our average fuel price per gallon increased 19 to 204 while total gallons consumed decreased 15 due to a reduction in mainline capacity and our sale of asa 

 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had hedged 36 of our projected fuel requirements for the march 2007 quarter using heating oil and jet fuel zerocost collar contracts with a weighted average contract cap and floor price of 193 and 182 respectively we recognized a 17 million loss from the settlement of certain of these contracts at january 31 2007 during january 2007 we hedged approximately 24 of our projected fuel requirements for the nine months ending september 30 2007 using heating oil and jet fuel zerocost collar and swap contracts the swap contracts have a weighted average contract price of 158 and the zerocost collar contracts have a weighted average contract cap and floor price of 183 and 167 respectively as of january 31 2007 our open fuel hedge contracts had an estimated fair market value gain of 2 million we have not entered into any hedges for the december 2007 quarter we estimate that a 10 rise in the price per gallon of heating oil and jet fuel would change the estimated fair market value associated with our outstanding contracts at settlement to a 41 million gain 

 

we project that our aircraft fuel consumption will be 26 billion gallons in 2007 based on a projected average jet fuel price of 200 per gallon for 2007 a 10 rise in jet fuel prices would increase our aircraft fuel expense by 487 million inclusive of the impact of effective hedge instruments that have settled or are outstanding as of january 31 2007 

 

we did not have any fuel hedge contracts outstanding as of december 31 2005 

 

for additional information regarding derivative contracts and other exposures to market risks see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk from volatility in interest rates is primarily associated with our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate longterm debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings respectively from an increase in interest rates the following sensitivity analysis for longterm debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 excludes longterm debt subject to compromise due to our status as a debtorinpossession under chapter 11 at december 31 2006 and 2005 a 10 increase in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our longterm debt not subject to compromise by 114 million and 78 million respectively and increase interest expense by 24 million and 19 million respectively at december 31 2006 and 2005 we did not have any interest rate swaps or contractual arrangements that would reduce our interest expense for additional information on our longterm debt agreements see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

while operating as a debtorinpossession in accordance with sop 907 we record interest expense only to the extent 1 interest will be paid during our chapter 11 proceeding or 2 it is probable interest will be an allowed priority secured or unsecured claim interest expense recorded on our consolidated statements of operations totaled 870 million for 2006 contractual interest expense including interest expense that is associated with obligations classified as liabilities subject to compromise totaled 12 billion for 2006

 item 1 business tableend 

general description 

  we are a major air carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states and around the world as of december 31 2004 we including our whollyowned subsidiaries atlantic southeast airlines inc “asa” and comair inc “comair” served 176 domestic cities in 43 states the district of columbia puerto rico and the us virgin islands as well as 51 cities in 33 countries with our domestic and international codeshare partners our route network covers 224 domestic cities in 49 states and 223 cities in 89 countries we are managed as a single business unit 

  based on calendar year 2004 data we are the secondlargest airline in terms of passengers carried and the thirdlargest airline measured by operating revenues and revenue passenger miles flown we are a leading us transatlantic airline serving the largest number of nonstop markets and offering the most daily flight departures among us airlines we have the secondmost transatlantic passengers 

  for each of the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 passenger revenues accounted for 92 of our consolidated operating revenues and cargo revenues and other sources accounted for 8 of our consolidated operating revenues in 2004 our operations in north america the atlantic latin america and the pacific accounted for 81 14 4 and 1 respectively of our consolidated operating revenues in 2003 our operations in north america the atlantic latin america and the pacific accounted for 83 12 4 and 1 respectively of our consolidated operating revenues in 2002 our operations in north america the atlantic latin america and the pacific accounted for 82 13 4 and 1 respectively of our consolidated operating revenues 

  we are incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware our principal executive offices are located at hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport in atlanta georgia the “atlanta airport” our telephone number is 404 7152600 and our internet address is wwwdeltacom 

  see “— risk factors relating to delta” and “— risk factors relating to the airline industry” in this item 1 and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — business environment” in item 7 for additional discussion of trends and factors affecting us and our industry 

airline operations 

  an important characteristic of our route network is our hub airports in atlanta cincinnati and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes delta flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs our hub and spoke system also provides passengers with access to our principal international gateways in atlanta and new york — john f kennedy international airport “jfk” as briefly discussed below other key characteristics of our route network include our alliances with foreign airlines the delta connection program the delta shuttle song tm  

1 our lowfare service and our domestic marketing alliances including with continental airlines inc “continental” and northwest airlines inc “northwest” 

   we have formed bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing frequent flyer benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions and other marketing agreements 

  our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under international codesharing arrangements we and the foreign carriers publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on the foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our “dl” designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s twoletter designator code we have international codeshare arrangements in effect with aerolitoral aeromexico air france and certain of air france’s affiliated carriers operating flights beyond paris air jamaica alitalia avianca china airlines china southern csa czech airlines el al israel airlines flybe british european korean air royal air maroc and south african airways 

  delta aeromexico air france alitalia continental csa czech airlines klm royal dutch airlines “klm” korean air and northwest are members of the skyteam international airline alliance one goal of skyteam is to link the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations in 2002 we our european skyteam partners and korean air received limited antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation “dot” the grant of antitrust immunity enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales marketing and discount programs for customers in september 2004 we filed an application which is pending before the dot for sixway transatlantic antitrust immunity in order to add northwest and klm to the antitrust immunity we have with air france alitalia and csa czech airlines 

   the delta connection program is our regional carrier service which feeds traffic to our route system through contracts with regional air carriers that operate flights serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities the program enables us to increase the number of flights in certain locations to better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets our delta connection network operates the largest number of regional jets in the united states 

  we have contractual arrangements with five regional carriers to operate regional jet and turboprop aircraft using our “dl” designator code asa and comair are our whollyowned subsidiaries which operate all of their flights under our code we also have agreements with skywest airlines inc “skywest” chautauqua airlines inc “chautauqua” and american eagle airlines inc “eagle” which operate some of their flights using our code we pay skywest and chautauqua amounts as defined in the applicable agreement which are based on an annual determination of their respective cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services we have recently entered into a comparable agreement with republic airline inc “republic airline” an affiliate of chautauqua under which republic airline is scheduled to begin operating some of their flights under our code in july 2005 for additional information regarding our agreements with skywest and chautauqua see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  our contract with eagle which is limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of our skywest agreement are structured as revenue proration agreements these prorate arrangements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries 

   the delta shuttle is our high frequency service targeted to northeast business travelers it provides nonstop hourly service between new york — laguardia airport “laguardia” marine air terminal and both boston — logan international airport “logan” and washington dc — ronald reagan national airport “national” 

   on april 15 2003 we introduced a new lowfare operation song that primarily offers flights between cities in the northeastern united states los angeles las vegas and florida leisure destinations as of december 31 2004 song offered 142 daily flights using a fleet of 36 b757 aircraft in september 2004 we announced plans to convert 12 mainline aircraft to song service in 2005 which will enable song to expand its service to additional markets during 2005 song is intended to assist us in competing more effectively with lowcost carriers in leisure markets through a combination of larger aircraft than those operated by lowcost carriers high frequency flights advanced inflight entertainment technology and innovative product offerings 

   we have entered into marketing alliances with 1 continental and northwest and 2 alaska airlines and horizon air industries both of which include mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements these marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks currently delta continental and northwest are allowed to codeshare on a combined 5200 flights 

regulatory matters 

  the dot and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the united states the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds “fit” to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by essential air service regulations which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction 

  the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices or methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety 

  authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the dot and by the foreign governments involved international route awards are also subject to the approval of the president of the united states for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives 

  the transportation security administration a division of the department of homeland security is responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports 

  airlines are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations the department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations 

fares and rates 

  airlines set ticket prices in most domestic and international city pairs without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved most of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

  in january 2005 we announced the expansion of our simplifares tm initiative throughout the 48 contiguous united states an important part of our transformation plan simplifares is a fundamental change in our domestic pricing structure which is intended to better meet customer needs to simplify our business and to help us achieve a lower cost structure under simplifares we lowered unrestricted fares on some routes by as much as 50 reduced the number of fare categories implemented a fare cap and eliminated the saturdaynight stay requirement that existed for certain fares while simplifares is expected to have a negative impact on our operating results for some period we believe it will provide net benefits to us over the longer term by stimulating traffic improving productivity by simplifying our product and increasing customer usage of deltacom our lowest cost distribution channel 

route authority 

  our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and to a limited extent by exemptions issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the united states and the foreign country or countries involved changes in united states or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the united states and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time 

  certain of our international route and codesharing authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance of this result dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

competition 

  we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers many of which have substantially lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us we also compete with allcargo carriers charter airlines regional jet operators and particularly on our shorter routes surface transportation 

  the continuing growth of lowcost carriers including southwest airtran and jetblue in the united states places significant competitive pressures on us and other network carriers in addition other hubandspoke carriers such as united airlines us airways and ata airlines have sought to reorganize under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in their respective proceedings these airlines have reduced or are seeking to reduce their operating costs by reducing labor costs including through renegotiating collective bargaining agreements terminating pension plans and restructuring lease and debt obligations additionally american airlines restructured certain labor costs and lowered its operating cost base these reorganizations and restructurings have enabled these competitors to lower their operating costs significantly our ability to compete effectively with lowcost carriers and other airlines depends in part on our ability to achieve operating costs per available seat mile “unit costs” that are competitive with those carriers 

  international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german airlines and others and the oneworld alliance among american airlines british airways and others have significantly increased competition in international markets through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers 

4   we regularly monitor competitive developments in the airline industry and evaluate our strategic alternatives these strategic alternatives include among other things internal growth codesharing arrangements marketing alliances joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions our evaluations involve internal analysis and where appropriate discussions with third parties 

  at the end of 2003 we began a strategic reassessment of our business the goal of this project was to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy that addresses the airline industry environment and positions us to achieve longterm sustained success as part of this project we evaluated the appropriate cost reduction targets and the actions we should take to seek to achieve these targets on september 8 2004 we outlined key elements of our transformation plan which are intended to achieve the cost savings and other benefits that we believe are necessary to effect an outofcourt restructuring the initiatives that we announced are part of our overall strategic reassessment see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — business environment — our transformation plan” in item 7 for additional information about our transformation plan 

airport access 

  operations at three major us airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through “slot” allocations each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period 

  in the united states the faa currently regulates slot allocations at jfk and laguardia in new york and national in washington dc our operations at those three airports generally require slot allocations under legislation enacted by congress slot rules will be phased out at jfk and laguardia by 2007 

  we currently have sufficient slot authorizations to operate our existing flights and have generally been able to obtain slots to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to obtain slots for these purposes in the future because among other reasons slot allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 

possible legislation or dot regulation 

  a number of congressional bills and proposed dot regulations have been considered in recent years to address airline competition issues some of these proposals would require large airlines with major operations at certain airports to divest or make available to other airlines slots gates facilities and other assets at those airports other measures would limit the service or pricing responses of major carriers that appear to target new entrant airlines in addition concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the dot and faa to consider various proposals for access to certain airports including “congestionbased” landing fees and programs that would withdraw slots from existing carriers and reallocate those slots either by lottery or auction to the highest bidder or to carriers with little or no current presence at such airports these proposals if enacted could negatively impact our existing services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines 

fuel 

  our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 20022004 

  

   aircraft fuel expense increased 51 in 2004 compared to 2003 total gallons consumed increased 7 in 2004 mainly due to the restoration of capacity that we reduced in 2003 due to the war in iraq the average fuel price per gallon in 2004 rose 42 to 116 as compared to an average price of 8178¢ in 2003 our fuel cost is 

5 shown net of fuel hedge gains of 105 million for 2004 152 million for 2003 and 136 million for 2002 approximately 8 65 and 56 of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in february 2004 we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their scheduled settlement dates for more information concerning the settlement of our fuel hedge contracts see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price 

  while we currently have no fuel hedge contracts we may periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative contracts to attempt to reduce our exposure to changes in fuel prices information regarding our fuel hedging program is set forth under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — market risks associated with financial instruments — aircraft fuel price risk” in item 7 and in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  for more information about the impact of jet fuel prices on our liquidity needs see “risk factors relating to delta — we have substantial liquidity needs and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary financing to meet those needs on acceptable terms if at all” 

  although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 

employee matters 

   our relations with labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class under the nmb’s usual rules a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of those employees vote for union representation 

  under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request the nmb to appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the president of the united states appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation which among other things imposes a settlement on the parties 

   at december 31 2004 we had a total of approximately 69150 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 18 of these employees are represented by unions the following table presents certain information concerning the union representation of our domestic employees 

  

   asa is in collective bargaining negotiations with the air line pilots association international “alpa” which represents asa’s pilots and with the association of flight attendants “afa” which represents asa’s flight attendants the outcome of these collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined 

  in march 2005 comair’s pilots ratified a tentative agreement that comair had reached with alpa which represents comair’s pilots to amend their existing agreement the agreement extends the amendable date of the existing agreement between comair and alpa from may 21 2006 to may 21 2007 includes a freeze of current pay rates and modifies the existing agreement in certain other respects the amendments to the existing agreement are conditioned upon comair’s satisfying requirements to begin taking delivery of additional aircraft by june 21 2005 and to place into service a specified number of aircraft over a defined period of time 

  comair is also in collective bargaining negotiations with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers which represents comair’s maintenance employees the maintenance employees rejected a tentative agreement to amend their existing agreement that became amendable in may 2004 which comair had reached with the union’s negotiating committee but comair expects negotiations to continue in addition comair is negotiating with the international brotherhood of teamsters which represents comair’s flight attendants to modify their existing collective bargaining agreement which becomes amendable in july 2007 the outcome of these negotiations cannot presently be determined 

  labor unions are engaged in organizing efforts to represent various groups of employees of us asa and comair who are not represented for collective bargaining purposes the outcome of these organizing efforts cannot presently be determined 

environmental matters 

  the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system it generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have 

7 had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

  on december 1 2003 the faa published a notice of proposed rulemaking “nprm” to adopt the international civil aviation organization’s “icao” chapter 4 noise standard which is known as the stage 4 standard in the united states this standard would require that all new commercial jet aircraft designs certified on or after january 1 2006 be at least ten decibels quieter than the existing stage 3 noise standard requires this new standard would not apply to existing aircraft or to the continued production of aircraft types already certified comments on the nprm were filed by various parties on march 1 2004 all new aircraft that we have on order will meet the proposed stage 4 standard accordingly the proposed rule is not expected to have any significant impact on us and we and the us airline industry generally supported the adoption of the nprm the faa has not yet taken final action 

  the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions our aircraft comply with the applicable epa standards the epa has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to adopt the emissions control standards for aircraft engines previously adopted by the icao these standards would apply to newly designed engines certified after december 31 2003 and would align the us aircraft engine emission standards with existing international standards the rule as proposed is not expected to have a material impact on us 

  in december 2004 miamidade county filed a lawsuit in florida circuit court against us seeking injunctive relief and alleging responsibility for past and future environmental cleanup costs and civil penalties for environmental conditions at miami international airport this lawsuit is related to several other actions filed by the county to recover environmental remediation costs incurred at the airport we are vigorously defending this lawsuit an adverse decision in this case could result in substantial damages against us although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program 

  we have a frequent flyer program the skymiles® program offering incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows participants to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta connection carriers and participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program partners such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies telecommunication services and internet services in addition we have programs under which individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice 

  mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airline partners for membership in our crown room club and for other program partner awards travel awards are subject to certain transfer restrictions and capacitycontrolled seating in some cases blackout dates may apply miles earned prior to may 1 1995 do not expire so long as we have a frequent flyer program miles earned or purchased on or after may 1 1995 will not expire as long as at least once every three years the participant 1 takes a qualifying flight on delta or a delta connection carrier 2 earns miles through one of our program partners or 3 redeems miles for any program award 

  we account for our frequent flyer program obligations by recording a liability for the estimated incremental cost of travel awards we expect to be redeemed the estimated incremental cost associated with a travel award does not include any contribution to overhead or profit such incremental cost is based on our system average 

8 cost per passenger for fuel food and other direct passenger costs we do not record a liability for mileage earned by participants who have not reached the level to become eligible for a free travel award we believe this is appropriate because the large majority of these participants are not expected to earn a travel award we do not record a liability for the expected redemption of miles for nontravel awards since the cost of these awards to us is negligible 

  we estimated the potential number of roundtrip travel awards outstanding under our frequent flyer program to be 15 million 14 million and 14 million at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively of these travel awards we expected that approximately 6 million 10 million and 10 million respectively would be redeemed at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we had recorded a liability for these awards of 211 million 229 million and 228 million respectively the difference between the roundtrip awards outstanding and the awards expected to be redeemed is the estimate based on historical data of awards which will 1 never be redeemed or 2 be redeemed for something other than award travel 

  frequent flyer program participants flew 29 million 28 million and 28 million award roundtrips on delta in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively these roundtrips accounted for approximately 8 9 and 9 of the total passenger miles flown for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we believe that the relatively low percentage of passenger miles flown by skymiles members traveling on program awards and the restrictions applied to travel awards minimize the displacement of revenue passengers 

civil reserve air fleet program 

  we participate in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program during the period october 1 2004 through september 30 2005 a portion of our international range aircraft as of december 31 2004 the following numbers of our aircraft are available for craf activation 

   the craf program has only been activated twice both times at the stage i level since it was created in 1951

risks factors relating to delta 

   we reported a net loss of 52 billion 773 million and 13 billion for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we expect our revenue and cost challenges to continue in addition deloitte  touche llp our independent registered public accounting firm issued a report of independent registered public accounting firm related to our consolidated financial statements that contains an explanatory paragraph that makes reference to uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern future reports may continue to contain this explanatory paragraph 

  in connection with our restructuring efforts in the december 2004 quarter we determined that there are anticipated annual benefits from our transformation plan sufficient for us to achieve financial viability by way of an outofcourt restructuring including reduction of pilot costs of at least 1 billion annually by the end of 2006 and other benefits of at least 17 billion annually by the end of 2006 in addition to the approximately 23 billion of annual benefits compared to 2002 achieved by the end of 2004 through previously implemented profit improvement initiatives this determination however was based on a number of material assumptions including without limitation assumptions about fuel prices yields competition and our access to additional sources of financing on acceptable terms any number of these assumptions many of which such as fuel prices are not within our control could prove to be incorrect 

10   even if we achieve all of the approximately 5 billion in targeted annual benefits from our transformation plan we may need even greater cost savings because our industry has been subject to progressively increasing competitive pressure we cannot assure you that these anticipated benefits will be achieved or that if they are achieved that they will be adequate for us to maintain financial viability 

  in addition our transformation plan involves significant changes to our business we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing the plan or that key elements such as employee job reductions will not have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations particularly in the near term although we have assumed that incremental revenues from our transformation plan will more than offset related costs in light of the competitive pressures we face we cannot assure you that we will be successful in realizing any of such incremental revenues 

  if we are not successful in further reducing our operating expenses and continue to experience significant losses we would need to seek to restructure our costs under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code a restructuring under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code may be particularly difficult because we pledged substantially all of our remaining unencumbered collateral in connection with transactions we completed in the december 2004 quarter as a part of our outofcourt restructuring 

   even if we are successful in achieving all of the approximately 5 billion in targeted benefits under our transformation plan we do not expect to achieve the full 5 billion until the end of 2006 as we transition to a lower cost structure we continue to face significant challenges due to low passenger mile yields historically high fuel prices and other cost pressures related to interest expense and pension and related expense accordingly we believe that we will record a substantial net loss in 2005 and that our cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs for that period 

  we currently expect to meet our liquidity needs for 2005 from cash flows from operations our available cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments commitments from a third party to finance on a longterm secured basis our purchase of 32 regional jet aircraft to be delivered to us in 2005 and the final 250 million borrowing under our financing agreement with american express travel related services company inc “amex” which occurred on march 1 2005 because substantially all of our assets are encumbered and our credit ratings have been substantially lowered we do not expect to be able to obtain any material amount of additional debt financing unless we are able to sell assets or access the capital markets by issuing equity or convertible debt securities we expect that our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be substantially lower at december 31 2005 than at the end of 2004 

  our liquidity needs will be substantially higher than we expect if 

 11 

   if the assumptions underlying our business plan prove to be incorrect in any material adverse respect and we are unable to sell assets or access the capital markets or if our level of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments otherwise declines to an unacceptably low level then we would need to seek to restructure under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 

   the terms of our financing agreements with ge commercial finance and amex restrict our ability to among other things incur additional indebtedness pay dividends or make other payments on investments consummate asset sales or similar transactions create liens merge or consolidate with any other person or sell assign transfer lease convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets the terms also contain covenants that require us to meet financial tests in order to continue to borrow under the facility and to avoid a default that might lead to an early termination of the facility if we were not able to comply with these covenants our outstanding obligations under these facilities could be accelerated and become due and payable immediately the terms of the credit facilities including these covenants are generally described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — financial condition and liquidity — covenants” in item 7 

   we have now and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and other obligations as well as substantial pension funding obligations as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 139 billion of total consolidated indebtedness including capital leases we also have minimum rental commitments with a present value of approximately 64 billion under noncancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year on december 1 2004 we received an aggregate of 830 million in financing pursuant to separate financing agreements with ge commercial finance and amex except for commitments to finance our purchases of regional jet aircraft and the additional 250 million prepayment that we received from amex on march 1 2005 we have no available lines of credit additionally we believe that our access to additional financing on acceptable terms is limited at least in the near term if we cannot achieve a competitive cost structure and regain sustained profitability we would need to seek to restructure our costs under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code a restructuring under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code may be particularly difficult because we pledged substantially all of our unencumbered collateral in connection with our outofcourt restructuring in the december 2004 quarter 

  our substantial indebtedness and other obligations have and in the future could continue to negatively impact our operations by 

 12 

   we sponsor qualified defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees our funding obligations under these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” we met our required funding obligations for these plans under erisa in 2004 

  estimates of the amount and timing of our future funding obligations for the pension plans are based on various assumptions these include assumptions concerning among other things the actual and projected market performance of the pension plan assets future longterm corporate bond yields statutory requirements and demographic data for pension plan participants the amount and timing of our future funding obligations also depends on the level of early retirements by pilots 

  we estimate that our funding obligations under our defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for 2005 will be approximately 450 million this estimate may vary depending on among other things the assumptions used to determine the amount this estimate reflects the projected impact of the election we made in 2004 to utilize the alternative deficit reduction contribution relief provided by the pension funding equity act of 2004 that legislation permits us to defer payment of a portion of the otherwise required funding our anticipated funding obligations under our pension plans for 2006 and thereafter vary materially depending on the assumptions used to determine these funding obligations including potential legislative changes regarding pension funding obligations absent the enactment of new federal legislation that reduces our pension funding obligations during the next several years our annual pension funding obligations for each of the years 2006 through 2009 will be significantly higher than in 2005 and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 

   under the delta pilots retirement plan “pilots retirement plan” delta pilots who retire can elect to receive 50 of their accrued pension benefit in a lump sum in connection with their retirement and the remaining 50 as an annuity after retirement during certain recent months our pilots have taken early retirement at greater than historical levels apparently due to 1 a perceived risk of rising interest rates which could reduce the amount of their lump sum pension benefit andor 2 concerns about their ability to receive a lump sum pension benefit if a we were to seek to restructure our costs under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and b a notice of intent to terminate the pilots retirement plan is issued if early retirements by pilots occur at greater than historical levels in the future this could depending on the number of pilots who retire early the aircraft types these pilots operate and other factors disrupt our operations negatively impact our revenues and increase our pension funding obligations significantly approximately 1800 of our 6400 pilots are currently at or over age 50 and thus are eligible to retire 

   our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the availability or price of aircraft fuel fuel prices increased substantially in 2004 when our average fuel price per gallon rose 42 to approximately 116 as compared to an average price of 8178¢ in 2003 our fuel costs represented 16 13 and 11 of our operating expenses in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively due to the competitive nature of the airline industry we generally have not been able to increase our fares when fuel prices have risen in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future 

  our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price none of our aircraft fuel requirements are currently hedged 

  although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries 

13 changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and additional fuel price increases in the future 

   our business is highly dependent on our ability to access the capital markets since september 11 2001 our senior unsecured longterm debt ratings have been lowered to ca by moody’s investors service inc cc by standard  poor’s rating services and c by fitch ratings moody’s and fitch have stated that their ratings outlook for our senior unsecured debt is negative while we are on positive watch with standard  poor’s our credit ratings may be lowered further or withdrawn we do not have debt obligations that accelerate as a result of a credit ratings downgrade we believe that our access to the capital markets for new borrowings is limited at least in the near term 

   our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in cincinnati and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at the atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

   we are increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have made significant investments in checkin kiosks delta direct phone banks and related initiatives across the system the performance and reliability of our technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively in this challenging business environment we may not be able to continue to make sufficient capital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver these expected benefits 

  in addition any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or the internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of our technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs like all companies our technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business 

   we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans our deteriorating financial performance creates uncertainty that has led and may continue to lead to departures of our officers and key employees if we were to continue to experience a substantial turnover in our leadership our performance could be materially adversely impacted additionally we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future 

   our business is labor intensive requiring large numbers of pilots flight attendants mechanics and other personnel approximately 18 of our workforce is unionized strikes or labor disputes with our and our 

14 affiliates’ unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date our collective bargaining agreement with alpa which represents our pilots becomes amendable on december 31 2009 

  asa is in collective bargaining negotiations with alpa which represents asa’s pilots and with the association of flight attendants which represents asa’s flight attendants to amend their existing collective bargaining agreements that became amendable in september 2002 and september 2003 respectively comair is also in collective bargaining negotiations with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers which represents comair’s maintenance employees the maintenance employees rejected a tentative agreement to amend their existing agreement that became amendable in may 2004 which comair had reached with the union’s negotiating committee but comair expects negotiations to continue in addition comair is negotiating with the international brotherhood of teamsters which represents comair’s flight attendants to modify their existing collective bargaining agreement which becomes amendable in july 2007 the outcome of asa and comair’s collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined in addition to the asa and comair negotiations if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages 

   we are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business we are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 it appears that the plaintiffs in these september 11 actions are alleging that we and many other air carriers are jointly liable for damages resulting from the terrorist attacks based on a theory of shared responsibility for passenger security screening at logan washington dulles international airport and newark liberty international airport these lawsuits which are in preliminary stages generally seek unspecified damages including punitive damages although federal law limits the financial liability of any air carrier for compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the september 11 terrorist attacks to no more than the limits of liability insurance coverage maintained by the air carrier it is possible that we may be required to pay damages in the event of our insurer’s insolvency or otherwise 

  while we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain of our legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify damages being sought if the outcome of any significant litigation is adverse to us our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 

   if one of our aircraft were to crash or be involved in an accident we could be exposed to significant tort liability the insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate in the event that our insurance is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business 

   under federal income tax law a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income in any year net operating losses carried forward from prior years we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 75 billion as of december 31 2004 our ability to deduct net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to a significant limitation if we were to seek to restructure our costs under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and undergo an “ownership change” for purposes of section 382 of the internal revenue 

15 code of 1986 as amended an “ownership change” even outside of a chapter 11 restructuring there can be no assurances that future actions by us or third party will not trigger an ownership change resulting in a limitation on our ability to deduct net operating loss carryforwards 

risks factors relating to the airline industry 

   since september 11 2001 several air carriers have sought to reorganize under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code including united airlines the secondlargest us air carrier us airways the seventh largest us air carrier ata airlines the tenthlargest us air carrier and several smaller competitors since filing for chapter 11 on august 11 2002 us airways emerged from bankruptcy but announced on september 12 2004 that it is again seeking to reorganize under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in their respective proceedings united and us airways have reduced or are seeking to reduce their operating costs by reducing labor costs including through renegotiating collective bargaining agreements terminating pension plans and restructuring lease and debt obligations additionally american airlines restructured certain labor costs and lowered its operating cost base these reorganizations and restructurings have enabled these competitors to significantly lower their operating costs our unit costs went from being among the lowest of the hubandspoke carriers in 2002 to among the highest in 2004 a result that placed us at a serious competitive disadvantage while we believe that the 5 billion in targeted annual benefits compared to 2002 from our transformation plan including 1 billion in longterm annual cost savings achieved through the new collective bargaining agreement with our pilots will contribute to a reduction of our unit costs our cost structure will still be higher than that of lowcost carriers 

   since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the airline industry has experienced fundamental and permanent changes including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which have resulted in industrywide liquidity issues the terrorist attacks significantly reduced the demand for air travel and additional terrorist activity involving the airline industry could have an equal or greater impact although global economic conditions have improved from their depressed levels after september 11 2001 the airline industry has continued to experience a reduction in highyield business travel and increased price sensitivity in customers’ purchasing behavior in addition aircraft fuel prices have recently been at historically high levels the airline industry has continued to add or restore capacity despite these conditions we expect all of these conditions will continue and may adversely impact our operations and profitability 

   we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have substantially lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us our revenues continue to be materially adversely impacted by the growth of lowcost carriers with which we compete in most of our markets significant expansion by lowcost carriers to our hub airports could have an adverse impact on our business we also face increasing competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from rapidly expanding regional jet operators in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets 

   airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations 

16   other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues for example the aviation and transportation security act which became law in november 2001 mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines the federal government has recently proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax due to the weak revenue environment the existing tax has negatively impacted our revenues because we have not been able to increase our fares to pass these fees on to our customers similarly the proposed ticket tax increase if implemented could negatively impact our revenues 

  furthermore we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion 

   as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general since september 24 2001 the us government has been providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses including those resulting from terrorism to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull the coverage currently extends through august 31 2005 with a possible extension to december 31 2005 at the discretion of the secretary of transportation the withdrawal of government support of airline warrisk insurance would require us to obtain warrisk insurance coverage commercially such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than currently provided by the us government may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism may result in a material increase to our operating expenses and may result in an interruption to our operations

 item 2 properties tableend 

flight equipment 

  the table set forth below shows our aircraft fleet at december 31 2004 

  

    our purchase commitments firm orders for aircraft as well as options to purchase additional aircraft as of december 31 2004 are shown below 

  

 18   

   our longterm agreement with the boeing company “boeing” covers firm orders options and rolling options for certain aircraft through calendar year 2017 this agreement supports our plan for disciplined growth aircraft rationalization and fleet replacement it also gives us certain flexibility to adjust scheduled aircraft deliveries and to substitute between aircraft models and aircraft types the majority of the aircraft under firm order from boeing will be used to replace older aircraft 

  our plan is to reduce mainline aircraft fleet complexity by up to four fleet types over approximately the next four years we believe fleet simplification will improve reliability and produce longterm cost savings during 2005 we expect to retire 24 mainline aircraft 21 b737300 and b737200 aircraft and three b767200 aircraft these retirements will not have a material impact on our 2005 consolidated financial statements due to weak traffic we temporarily grounded the entire md11 fleet by the end of january 2004 and sold eight owned md11 aircraft in october 2004 as a result of these actions in 2004 we operated a mainline fleet composed entirely of twopilot twoengine aircraft 

  our regional jet operations offer service to small and mediumsized cities and enable us to supplement mainline frequencies and service to larger cities 

  as of december 31 2004 asa had returned two atr72 turbo prop aircraft to the lessor upon lease expiration asa continues to operate the remaining atr72 turbo prop aircraft while comair operates an alljet fleet 

ground facilities 

  we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases we own a portion of our principal offices our atlanta reservations center and other real property in atlanta 

  we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve these leases generally run for periods of less than one year to thirty years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates at most airports that we serve we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities at certain airports these leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities in addition to our atlanta maintenance base our other major aircraft maintenance facilities are located at cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport tampa international airport and salt lake city international airport we lease marketing ticket and reservations offices in certain locations these leases are generally for shorter terms than the airport leases additional information relating to our leases of our ground facilities is set forth in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

19   in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such charges is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially 

  the city of atlanta with our support and the support of other airlines has begun a ten year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport implementation of the cip should increase the number of flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays the cip includes among other things a new approximately 9000 foot fullservice runway targeted for completion in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements if fully implemented the cip is currently estimated by the city of atlanta to cost approximately 68 billion which exceeds the 54 billion cip approved by the airlines in 1999 the cip runs through 2010 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds certain elements of the cip have been delayed and there is no assurance that the cip will be fully implemented failure to implement certain portions of the cip in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at the atlanta airport 

  during 2001 we entered into lease and financing agreements with the massachusetts port authority “massport” for the redevelopment and expansion of terminal a at logan the completion of this project will enable us to consolidate all of our domestic operations at that airport into one location construction began in the june 2002 quarter and is scheduled to be completed in march 2005 project costs are being funded with 498 million in proceeds from special facilities revenue bonds issued by massport on august 16 2001 we agreed to pay the debt service on the bonds under a longterm lease agreement with massport and issued a guarantee to the bond trustee covering the payment of the debt service on the bonds additional information about these bonds is set forth in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend 

   in june 1999 two purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against us us airways and northwest 

  in these cases plaintiffs allege among other things 1 that the defendants and certain other airlines conspired in violation of section 1 of the sherman act to restrain competition in the sale of air passenger service by enforcing rules prohibiting certain ticketing practices and 2 that the defendants violated section 2 of the sherman act by prohibiting these ticketing practices 

  plaintiffs have requested a jury trial they seek injunctive relief costs and attorneys’ fees and unspecified damages to be trebled under the antitrust laws the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class action certification and denied the airlines’ motions for summary judgment in may 2002 on may 4 2004 the district court issued a supplemental order defining various plaintiff subclasses the subclasses pertinent to us include 1 for the purpose of the section 1 claim a subclass of persons or entities who purchased from a defendant or its agent a full fare unrestricted ticket for travel on any of certain designated city pairs originating or terminating at our atlanta or cincinnati hubs northwest’s hubs at minneapolis detroit or memphis or us airways’ hubs at pittsburgh or charlotte during the period from june 11 1995 to date 2 for the purpose of the section 2 claim as it relates to our atlanta hub a subclass of persons or entities who purchased from us or our agent a full fare unrestricted ticket for travel on any of certain designated city pairs originating or terminating at our atlanta hub during the same period and 3 for the purpose of the section 2 claim as it relates to our cincinnati hub a subclass of persons or entities who purchased from us or our agent a full fare unrestricted ticket for travel on any of certain designated city pairs originating or terminating at our cincinnati hub during the same period the district court has not scheduled the trial of these lawsuits 

   in january 2002 a travel agent in north carolina filed a class action lawsuit against numerous airlines including us in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina on behalf of all travel agents in the united states which sold tickets from september 1 1997 to the present on any of the defendant airlines the lawsuit alleges that we and the other airline defendants conspired to fix travel agent commissions in violation of section 1 of the sherman act the plaintiff who has requested a jury trial is seeking in its complaint injunctive relief costs and attorneys’ fees and unspecified damages to be trebled under the antitrust laws 

  in september 2002 the district court granted the plaintiff’s motion for class action certification certifying a class consisting of all travel agents in the united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands which sold tickets on the defendant airlines between 1997 and 2002 

  on october 30 2003 the district court granted summary judgment against the plaintiff class dismissing all claims asserted against us and most other defendants on december 9 2004 the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment on january 4 2005 the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing en banc the plaintiffs have agreed not to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court accordingly this case is now over 

   two travel agencies have filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the us district court for the central district of california on behalf of all travel agencies from which we have demanded payment for breach of the agencies’ contractual and fiduciary duties to us in connection with delta ticket sale transactions during the period from september 20 1997 to the present the lawsuit alleges that our conduct 1 violates the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 and 2 creates liability for unjust enrichment the plaintiffs who have requested a jury trial are seeking in their complaint injunctive and declaratory relief costs and attorneys’ fees and unspecified treble damages in january 2003 the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class action certification and in april 2003 granted our motion for summary judgment on all claims on 

21 january 6 2005 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment the time for plaintiffs to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court has not expired 

   in august 2002 a travel agency filed a purported class action lawsuit in new york state court against us american continental northwest united and jetblue on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of us travel agents jetblue has been dismissed from the case and the remaining defendants removed the action to the us district court for the southern district of new york the lawsuit alleges that the defendants breached their contracts with and their duties of good faith and fair dealing to us travel agencies when these airlines discontinued the payment of published base commissions to us travel agencies at various times beginning in march 2002 the plaintiffs’ amended complaint seeks unspecified damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief 

   during the june 2001 quarter the pilots retirement plan and related nonqualified pilot retirement plans sponsored and funded by us were named as defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in federal district courts in california massachusetts ohio new mexico and new york the complaints 1 seek to assert claims on behalf of a class consisting of certain groups of retired and active delta pilots 2 allege that the calculation of the retirement benefits of the plaintiffs and the class violated the pilots retirement plan and the internal revenue code and 3 seek unspecified damages in october 2001 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation granted our motion to transfer these cases to the us district court for the northern district of georgia for coordinated pretrial proceedings our motion to dismiss the nonqualified plans was granted and both sides have filed motions for summary judgment on all remaining claims 

   we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 it appears that the plaintiffs in these actions are alleging that we and many other air carriers are jointly liable for damages resulting from the terrorist attacks based on a theory of shared responsibility for passenger security screening at logan washington dulles international airport and newark liberty international airport these lawsuits which are in preliminary stages generally seek unspecified damages including punitive damages although federal law limits the financial liability of any air carrier for compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the september 11 terrorist attacks to no more than the limits of liability insurance coverage maintained by the air carrier it is possible that we may be required to pay damages in the event of our insurers’ insolvency or otherwise 

   on september 3 2004 a former delta employee filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and all other participants in the savings plan against delta and certain past and present members of delta’s board of directors alleging violations of erisa the complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary obligations under erisa during the period from november 2000 through august 2004 with respect to savings plan investments in our stock both in our common stock fund into which participants may direct their own contributions and the savings plan’s employee stock ownership plan component into which delta directs its contributions subsequent to the filing of the complaint an identical action was filed by a second former employee and a third similar action was filed by a different former employee the third suit contains additional claims and names all current members of the board of directors and several past directors as defendants attorneys for the plaintiffs have agreed to proceed with one consolidated complaint naming one plaintiff the complaints seek unspecified damages and have been filed in us district court in the northern district of georgia 

   

  as discussed above hall et al v united airlines et al is now over in each of the other foregoing cases we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and we are vigorously defending the lawsuits an adverse decision in any of these cases could result in substantial damages against us although the ultimate outcome of 

22 these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes that the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

business environment 

   our financial performance continued to deteriorate during 2004 the fourth consecutive year we reported substantial losses our consolidated net loss of 52 billion in 2004 reflects a net charge of 29 billion which is discussed elsewhere in this form 10k see notes 5 9 14 and 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements a significant decline in passenger mile yield historically high aircraft fuel prices and other cost pressures our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments were 18 billion at december 31 2004 down from 27 billion at december 31 2003 these results underscore the urgent need to make fundamental changes in the way we do business 

  our financial performance for 2004 was materially adversely affected by a decrease in passenger mile yield while revenue passenger miles “rpms” or traffic rose 11 during 2004 compared to the prior year passenger revenue increased only 6 reflecting a 4 decrease in the passenger mile yield on a yearoveryear basis we believe the decrease in passenger mile yield reflects permanent changes in the airline industry revenue environment which have occurred primarily due to the following factors 

   aircraft fuel prices also had a significant negative impact on our financial results in 2004 these prices reached historically high levels as our average fuel price per gallon increased 42 to 116 net of hedging gains for 2004 compared to the prior year aircraft fuel expense rose 51 or 986 million in 2004 compared to 2003 with approximately 820 million of the increase resulting from higher fuel prices 

  in light of our significant losses and the decline in our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments we are making permanent structural changes that are intended to appropriately align our cost structure with the revenue we can generate in this business environment and to enable us to compete with lowcost carriers 

   in 2002 we began our profit improvement program which had a goal of reducing our unit costs and increasing our revenues we made significant progress under this program but increases in aircraft fuel prices and pension and related expense and declining domestic passenger mile yields have offset a large portion of these benefits accordingly we will need substantial further reductions in our cost structure to achieve viability 

  at the end of 2003 we began a strategic reassessment of our business the goal of this project was to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy that addresses the airline industry environment and positions us to achieve longterm success as part of this project we evaluated the appropriate 

26 cost reduction targets and the actions we should take to seek to achieve these targets key elements of our transformation plan include 

   our transformation plan is intended to deliver approximately 5 billion in annual benefits by the end of 2006 as compared to 2002 while also improving the service we provide to our customers by the end of 2004 we achieved approximately 23 billion of the 5 billion in targeted benefits under our profit improvement program we have identified and begun implementation of the following key initiatives to obtain the remaining 27 billion in targeted benefits which we believe we are on track to achieve by the end of 2006 

 27   nonpilot operational improvements the targeted 16 billion of nonpilot operational improvements by the end of 2006 includes the following which are discussed further below 

   incremental profit improvement initiatives consist of cost savings and revenue enhancements these include technology and productivity enhancements including improvements in airport processes maintenance and distribution efficiency and overhead reductions including the elimination of 6000 to 7000 nonpilot jobs approximately 3400 employees elected to participate in voluntary workforce reduction programs 

  nonpilot pay and benefit savings are attributable to salary and benefit reductions the 350 million of estimated savings includes 1 an acrosstheboard 10 pay reduction for executives and supervisory administrative and frontline employees that was effective january 1 2005 2 increases to the shared cost of healthcare coverage 3 the elimination of a healthcare coverage subsidy for nonpilot employees who retire after january 1 2006 and 4 reduced vacation time 

  in january 2005 we dehubbed our dallasft worth operations and redeployed aircraft from that market to grow our hub operations in atlanta cincinnati and salt lake city we expect to benefit from this initiative through incremental revenue primarily due to greater utilization from the redeployment of these aircraft 

  in january 2005 we also redesigned our atlanta operation from a banked to a continuous hub although we will incur incremental costs under this initiative we believe the related incremental revenue will more than offset these costs we expect the net benefit to increase as we expand this initiative to our other hubs 

  we recorded significant gains and charges in 2004 in connection with some of our nonpilot operational initiatives these gains and charges include 1 a 527 million gain related to the elimination of the healthcare coverage subsidy for nonpilot employees who retire after january 1 2006 and 2 a 194 million charge related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs for additional information about these subjects see note 14 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  we will record additional charges relating to our nonpilot operational initiatives and pilot cost reductions including charges related to certain facility closures and employee items but we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or timing of any such charges including the amounts of such charges that may result in future cash expenditures at this time the targeted benefits under our transformation plan do not reflect any gains or charges described in this or the preceding paragraph 

  pilot cost reductions our pilot cost structure was significantly higher than that of our competitors and needed to be reduced in order for us to compete effectively on november 11 2004 we and our pilots union entered into an agreement that will provide us with 1 billion in longterm annual cost savings through a combination of changes in wages pension and other benefits and work rules the agreement 1 includes a 325 reduction to base pay rates on december 1 2004 2 does not include any scheduled increases in base pay rates and 3 includes benefit changes such as a 16 reduction in vacation pay increased cost sharing for active pilot and retiree medical benefits the amendment of the defined benefit pension plan to stop service accrual as of december 31 2004 and the establishment of a defined contribution pension plan as of january 1 2005 the agreement also states certain limitations on our ability to seek to modify it if we file for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the agreement becomes amendable on december 31 2009 

  other benefits our transformation plan also targets other benefits through concessions from aircraft lessors creditors and other vendors during the december 2004 quarter we entered into agreements with aircraft lessors and lenders under which we expect to receive average annual cash savings of approximately 57 million between 2005 and 2009 which will also result in some cost reductions we also reached agreements with about 

28 115 suppliers under which we expect to realize average annual benefits of approximately 46 million during 2005 2006 and 2007 

  simplifares tm  in january 2005 we announced the expansion of our simplifares initiative within the 48 contiguous united states an important part of our transformation plan simplifares is a fundamental change in our pricing structure which is intended to better meet customer needs to simplify our business and to assist us in achieving a lower cost structure under simplifares we lowered unrestricted fares on some routes by as much as 50 reduced the number of fare categories implemented a fare cap and eliminated the saturdaynight stay requirement that existed for certain fares while simplifares is expected to have a negative impact on our operating results for some period we believe it will provide net benefits to us over the longer term by stimulating traffic improving productivity by simplifying our product and increasing customer usage of deltacom our lowest cost distribution channel 

  liquidity due to the difficult revenue environment historically high fuel prices and other cost pressures we borrowed 24 billion in 2004 to fund daily operations and capital requirements repay debt obligations and increase our liquidity these borrowings included 830 million that we obtained during the december 2004 quarter under our financing agreements with ge commercial finance and amex these new financing agreements are essential elements of our ongoing restructuring efforts our borrowings under these agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets that were unencumbered immediately prior to the consummation of those agreements during 2004 we also deferred to later years certain debt obligations that were due in 2004 2005 and 2006 for additional information about our financing agreements with ge commercial finance and amex as well as our deferrals of debt during 2004 see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  at december 31 2004 we had cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 18 billion in march 2005 we borrowed the final installment of 250 million under our financing agreement with amex we have commitments from a third party to finance on a longterm secured basis our purchase of 32 regional jet aircraft to be delivered to us in 2005 “regional jet credit facility” we have no other undrawn lines of credit 

  we have significant obligations due in 2005 and thereafter our obligations due in 2005 include approximately 1 11 billion in operating lease payments 2 10 billion in interest payments which may vary as interest rates change on our 5 billion principal amount of variable rate debt 3 835 million in debt maturities approximately 630 million of which we expect will be cash payments for additional information about this amount see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and 4 450 million of estimated funding for our defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans absent the enactment of new federal legislation which reduces our pension funding obligations during the next several years our annual pension funding obligations for each of 2006 through 2009 will be significantly higher than in 2005 and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity for additional information about our contractual commitments see “financial position — contractual obligations” in this item 7 

  during 2005 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 10 billion this covers approximately 540 million for aircraft expenditures which includes 520 million to purchase 32 regional jets which we intend to finance under the regional jet credit facility our anticipated capital expenditures for 2005 also include approximately 215 million for aircraft parts and modifications and approximately 285 million for nonfleet capital expenditures 

  as discussed above we do not expect to achieve the full 5 billion in targeted benefits under our transformation plan until the end of 2006 as we transition to a lower cost structure we continue to face significant challenges due to low passenger mile yields historically high fuel prices and other cost pressures related to interest expense and pension and related expense accordingly we believe that we will record a substantial net loss in 2005 and that our cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs for that period 

  we currently expect to meet our liquidity needs for 2005 from cash flows from operations our available cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments the regional jet credit facility and the final 250 million borrowing under our financing agreement with amex because substantially all of our assets are encumbered and our credit ratings are low we do not expect to be able to obtain any material amount of additional debt financing unless we are able to sell assets or access the capital markets by issuing equity or convertible debt 

29 securities we expect that our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be substantially lower at december 31 2005 than at the end of 2004 

  our financing agreements with ge commercial finance and amex include covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations including covenants that require us 1 to maintain specified levels of cash and cash equivalents and 2 to achieve certain levels of ebitdar earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and aircraft rent as defined although under our business plan we expect to be in compliance with these covenants in 2005 we do not expect to exceed either of the required levels by a significant margin accordingly if any of the assumptions underlying our business plan proves to be incorrect we might not be in compliance with these covenants which could result in the outstanding borrowings under these agreements becoming immediately due and payable unless the lenders waive these covenant violations if this were to occur we would need to seek to restructure under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code for additional information about these financing agreements see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  many of the material assumptions underlying our business plan are not within our control these assumptions include that 1 we achieve in 2005 all the benefits of our transformation plan targeted to be achieved in that year and 2 the average annual jet fuel price per gallon in 2005 is approximately 122 with each 1¢ increase in the average annual jet fuel price per gallon increasing our liquidity needs by approximately 25 million per year unless we are successful in offsetting some or all of this increase through fare increases or additional cost reduction initiatives our business plan also includes significant assumptions about passenger mile yield which we expect to be lower in 2005 as compared to 2004 interest rates our ability to generate incremental revenues our pension funding obligations and credit card processor holdbacks our current visamastercard processing contract expires in august 2005 see “risk factors related to delta” concerning risks associated with sensitivities in our assumptions 

  if the assumptions underlying our business plan prove to be incorrect in any material adverse respect and we are unable to sell assets or access the capital markets or if our level of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments otherwise declines to an unacceptably low level we would need to seek to restructure under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 

basis of presentation of consolidated financial statements 

  the matters discussed above under “business environment” raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business accordingly our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 

results of operations — 2004 compared to 2003 

   we recorded a consolidated net loss of 52 billion 4107 diluted loss per share in 2004 compared to a consolidated net loss of 773 million 640 diluted loss per share in 2003 

   operating revenues totaled 150 billion in 2004 a 6 increase from 2003 passenger revenue increased 6 on a 9 increase in capacity the increase in passenger revenue reflects an 11 rise in rpms and a 4 decline in passenger mile yield the increase in capacity was primarily driven by the restoration of flights that we reduced in 2003 due to the war in iraq the decline in the passenger mile yield reflects our lack of pricing power due to the continuing growth of lowcost carriers with which we compete in most of our domestic markets high industry capacity and increased price sensitivity by our customers enhanced by the availability of airline fare information on the internet 

30   passenger revenue per asm “passenger rasm” decreased 3 to 909¢ load factor increased 14 points to 747 for additional information about factors impacting our passenger revenues for 2004 see the “business environment” section above 

  north american passenger revenues north american passenger revenues increased 4 to 111 billion for 2004 on a capacity increase of 7 rpms increased 9 while passenger mile yield fell 4 passenger rasm decreased 3 to 928¢ load factor increased by 11 points to 737 

  international passenger revenues international passenger revenues increased 18 to 26 billion during 2004 on a capacity increase of 15 rpms increased 19 while passenger mile yield remained unchanged passenger rasm increased 3 to 816¢ and load factor rose 22 points to 789 all of these increases are primarily due to the depressed levels in the prior year from the war in iraq 

  cargo and other revenues cargo revenues increased 7 to 500 million in 2004 primarily due to a 13 increase from higher international freight volume and yield which was partially offset by a 5 decrease due to lower mail volume and yield cargo ton miles increased 6 while cargo ton mile yield remained relatively flat other revenues increased 19 to 712 million primarily reflecting a 6 increase due to revenue from new airport handling contracts and other miscellaneous contracts a 5 rise due to increased administrative service charges and a 3 increase due to higher codeshare revenue from capacity increases we expect revenues from administrative service charges to decrease in 2005 due to a reduction in ticket change fees we implemented in conjunction with the expansion of simplifares in january 2005 increased volume in administrative service charges may offset some of this anticipated decrease 

   operating expenses were 183 billion for 2004 a 23 or 34 billion increase over 2003 as discussed below the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to 1 a 19 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2004 2 significantly higher fuel prices in 2004 than in 2003 and 3 398 million in reimbursements we received under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act “appropriations act” in 2003 which were recorded as an offset to operating expenses in that year operating capacity increased 9 to 152 billion asms primarily due to the restoration of capacity that we reduced in 2003 due to the war in iraq operating cost per available seat mile “casm” increased 13 to 1207¢ 

  salaries and related costs were relatively flat at 63 billion this reflects a 3 decline due to a decrease in benefit expenses from our cost savings initiatives and a 2 decline due to lower mainline headcount these decreases were offset by 1 a 3 increase due to higher pension and related expense 2 a 1 increase due to a 45 salary rate increase in may 2004 for our pilots under their collective bargaining agreement which was partially offset by their rate decrease effective december 1 2004 and 3 a 1 increase due to growth in operations 

  aircraft fuel expense increased 51 or 986 million to 29 billion with approximately 820 million of the increase resulting from higher fuel prices which remain at historically high levels the average fuel price per gallon increased 42 to 116 and total gallons consumed increased 7 approximately 8 and 65 of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during 2004 and 2003 respectively as discussed in note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in february 2004 we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their scheduled settlement dates resulting in a deferred gain of 82 million that we recognized during 2004 in 2004 our fuel expense is shown net of fuel hedge gains of 105 million which included the gain related to the early settlement our fuel expense for 2003 is shown net of fuel hedge gains of 152 million 

  contracted services expense increased 13 primarily reflecting a 4 increase from new contracts to provide airport handling and other miscellaneous services a 2 increase due to technology projects a 2 increase due to the suspension of the transportation security administration “tsa” security fee from june 1 2003 to september 30 2003 and subsequent reimbursements and a 2 increase resulting from higher capacity 

  expenses from our contract carrier arrangements increased 19 to 932 million largely reflecting an 8 increase from higher fuel costs a 7 increase due to growth under certain contract carrier arrangements and a 3 increase from higher maintenance expense 

31   aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 8 primarily due to increased materials volume and higher costs from scheduled maintenance events other selling expenses increased 5 primarily reflecting a 3 rise from increased credit card charges due to higher traffic and a 1 increase from advertising and promotions passenger service expense increased 7 primarily due to increased traffic 

  during december 2004 we recorded a 19 billion impairment charge primarily related to goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” for additional information about the impairment charge see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net totaled a 41 million net gain for 2004 compared to a 268 million net charge for 2003 the 2004 amount includes 1 a 527 million gain related to the elimination of the healthcare coverage subsidy for nonpilot employees who retire after january 1 2006 2 settlement charges totaling 257 million primarily related to our defined benefit pension plan for pilots “pilot plan” 3 a 194 million charge related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs and 4 a 40 million aircraft impairment charge related to our agreement entered into in the september 2004 quarter to sell eight owned md11 aircraft the charge for 2003 consists of 1 212 million related to settlements under the pilot plan 2 43 million related to a net curtailment loss for the cost of pension and postretirement obligations for participants under our 2002 workforce reduction programs and 3 41 million associated with the planned sale of 11 b737800 aircraft this charge was partially offset by a 28 million reduction to operating expenses from revised estimates of remaining costs associated with our restructuring activities for additional information about these restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  reimbursements under the appropriations act totaled 398 million in 2003 representing reimbursements from the us government to air carriers for certain passenger and air carrier security fees paid to the tsa we recorded these amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for additional information about the appropriations act see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  other operating expenses increased 20 this primarily reflects a 7 increase from higher professional fees mainly from our restructuring and contingency planning efforts a 4 increase due to a loss on certain aircraft transactions a 4 increase from a rise in the navigation charges due to increased international capacity and a 4 increase due to higher fuel taxes 

operating loss and operating margin 

  we incurred an operating loss of 33 billion for 2004 compared to an operating loss of 785 million for 2003 operating margin which is the ratio of operating income loss to operating revenues was 22 and 6 for 2004 and 2003 respectively 

other income expense 

  other expense net for 2004 was 684 million compared to other expense net of 404 million for 2003 this change is primarily attributable to the following 

 32  

   during 2004 we recorded an additional valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets which resulted in a 12 billion noncash charge to income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations for additional information about the income tax valuation allowance see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

results of operations — 2003 compared to 2002 

   we recorded a consolidated net loss of 773 million 640 diluted loss per share in 2003 compared to a consolidated net loss of 13 billion 1044 diluted loss per share in 2002 

   operating revenues increased 2 to 141 billion in 2003 compared to 2002 passenger revenues increased 2 to 130 billion rpms decreased 2 on a capacity decline of 4 while passenger mile yield increased 4 to 1273¢ for information about the factors negatively impacting the revenue environment see the “business environment” section above during 2003 the revenue environment was also negatively impacted by the military action in iraq 

  north american passenger revenues north american passenger revenues increased 2 to 107 billion in 2003 rpms increased 1 on a capacity decrease of 2 while passenger mile yield increased 1 load factors increased by 16 points 

  international passenger revenues international passenger revenues decreased 4 to 22 billion in 2003 rpms fell 12 on a capacity decline of 14 while passenger mile yield increased 9 the decline in international revenue passenger miles particularly in the atlantic region is due to the reduction in traffic in the period leading up to and during the military action in iraq in 2003 the increase in passenger mile yield primarily relates to the reduction of capacity in certain markets and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 

  cargo and other revenues cargo revenues increased 2 to 467 million in 2003 cargo ton miles decreased 6 due to reductions in capacity while cargo ton mile yield increased 8 other revenues decreased 2 to 598 million primarily reflecting decreases due to lower revenue from certain mileage partnership arrangements as well as a decline in codeshare revenue these decreases were partially offset by an increase in various miscellaneous revenues 

   operating expenses totaled 149 billion for 2003 decreasing 2 from 2002 operating capacity decreased 4 to 140 billion asms primarily due to capacity reductions implemented as a result of the military action in iraq we restored most of this capacity when passenger demand improved after the end of major military combat in iraq in may 2003 casm rose 2 to 1066¢ operating expenses and casm reflect 1 appropriations act reimbursements received during 2003 2 restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net recorded during 2003 and 2002 and 3 stabilization act compensation recorded in 2002 these items are discussed below 

33   salaries and related costs totaled 63 billion in 2003 a 3 increase from 2002 this 3 increase primarily reflects 1 a 5 increase from higher pension and related expense of approximately 290 million 2 a 2 increase due to salary rate increases primarily for pilots in the june 2003 and june 2002 quarters under their collective bargaining agreement and for mechanics in the june 2002 quarter and 3 a 2 increase due to growth in our wholly owned subsidiaries’ regional jet operations these increases were partially offset by a 6 decrease due to our 2002 workforce reduction programs the increase in pension expense mainly reflects the impact of declining interest rates a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets and scheduled pilot salary increases partially offset by approximately 120 million in expense reductions from the transition of our nonpilot defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan for additional information related to this transition see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  aircraft fuel expense totaled 19 billion during 2003 a 15 increase from 2002 this increase is primarily due to higher fuel prices partially offset by capacity reductions the average fuel price per gallon rose 22 to 8178¢ while total gallons consumed decreased 6 our fuel cost is shown net of fuel hedge gains of 152 million for 2003 and 136 million for 2002 approximately 65 and 56 of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during 2003 and 2002 respectively for additional information about our fuel hedge contracts see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  depreciation and amortization expense rose 6 in 2003 primarily due to the acquisition of regional jet aircraft and an increase in software amortization associated with completed technology projects 

  contracted services expense declined 12 primarily due to reduced traffic and capacity the suspension of the air carrier security fees under the appropriations act between june 1 2003 and september 30 2003 and a decrease in contracted services across certain workgroups for additional information about the appropriations act see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  expenses from our contract carrier arrangements increased 40 to 784 million primarily due to growth under our agreement with chautauqua 

  landing fees and other rents rose 3 primarily due to higher landing fees adopted by airports seeking to recover lost revenue due to decreased traffic and increased facility rates aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense fell 11 primarily from reduced maintenance volume and materials consumption as a result of process improvement initiatives lower capacity and our fleet simplification program aircraft rent expense increased 3 mainly due to our decision in the december 2002 quarter to return our b737300 leased aircraft to service during 2003 for additional information related to this decision see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  other selling expenses fell 11 this decline primarily reflects a 9 decrease related to lower booking fees from decreased traffic and a 3 decline from higher sales of mileage credits under our skymiles program because a portion of this revenue is recorded as an offset to other selling expenses these decreases were partially offset by an increase in advertising expenses due to the launch of song our lowfare service passenger commission expense declined 34 primarily reflecting a 22 decrease from the change in our commission rate structure in 2002 which resulted in the elimination of travel agent base commissions for tickets sold in the us and canada the decrease in passenger commissions also reflects the cancellation or renegotiation of certain travel agent contracts and a lower volume of base and incentive commissions passenger service expense decreased 13 primarily reflecting a 10 decline from decreased traffic and capacity and a 7 decrease due to certain meal servicerelated cost savings initiatives 

  restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net totaled 268 million in 2003 compared to 439 million in 2002 our 2003 charge consists of 1 212 million related to settlements under the pilot plan 2 43 million related to a net curtailment loss for the cost of pension and postretirement obligations for participants under our 2002 workforce reduction programs and 3 41 million associated with the planned sale of 11 b737800 aircraft this charge was partially offset by a 28 million reduction to operating expenses from revised estimates of remaining costs associated with our restructuring activities our 2002 charge consists of 1 251 million in asset writedowns 2 127 million related to our 2002 workforce reduction programs 3 93 million for the temporary carrying cost of surplus pilots and grounded aircraft 4 30 million due to the deferred delivery of certain boeing aircraft 5 14 million for the closure of certain leased facilities and 6 3 million related to other items this charge was partially offset by 1 the reversal of a 56 million reserve 

34 for future lease payments related to nine b737300 leased aircraft as a result of a decision in 2002 to return these aircraft to service and 2 a 23 million adjustment of certain prior year restructuring reserves based on revised estimates of remaining costs for additional information on these restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  appropriations act reimbursements totaled 398 million in 2003 representing reimbursements from the us government to air carriers for certain passenger and air carrier security fees we recorded these amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for additional information about the appropriations act see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  stabilization act compensation totaled 34 million in 2002 representing amounts we recognized as compensation in the applicable period under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act “stabilization act” we recorded these amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for additional information about the stabilization act see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  other operating expenses fell 16 primarily reflecting a 9 decrease due to lower insurance rates under us governmentprovided insurance policies and lower volumerelated insurance premiums due to decreased capacity and traffic as well as a 3 decline due to lower communication and supplies expenses 

   we incurred an operating loss of 785 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of 13 billion in 2002 operating margin was 6 and 9 for 2003 and 2002 respectively 

   other expense net totaled 404 million during 2003 compared to other expense net of 693 million in 2002 included in these results are the following

financial condition and liquidity 

   cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 18 billion at december 31 2004 compared to 27 billion at december 31 2003 for 2004 net cash used in operating activities totaled 11 billion which includes the following items 

   capital expenditures include 1 cash used for flight equipment including advance payments 2 cash used for ground property and equipment including expenditures net of reimbursements related to our boston airport terminal project and 3 aircraft delivered under sellerfinancing arrangements which is a noncash item during 2004 capital expenditures were approximately 920 million which included the acquisition of 23 crj700 aircraft we acquired 17 of these regional jet aircraft through sellerfinancing arrangements for 314 million 

  debt and capital lease obligations including current maturities and shortterm obligations totaled 139 billion at december 31 2004 compared to 126 billion at december 31 2003 during 2004 we engaged in the following financing transactions 

   during the december 2004 quarter we entered into agreements with aircraft lessors and lenders under which we expect to receive average annual cash savings of approximately 57 million between 2005 and 2009 which will also result in some cost reductions we issued an aggregate of 4354724 shares of our common stock to the aircraft lessors and lenders in these transactions separately as a result of agreements with approximately 115 suppliers we expect to realize average annual benefits of approximately 46 million during 2005 2006 and 2007 

36   in october 2004 we sold eight owned md11 aircraft and related inventory for 227 million we recorded a 41 million impairment charge related to the sale of the aircraft for additional information about this charge see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  during november 2004 we sold our remaining equity investment in orbitz for approximately 143 million we recorded a 123 million gain related to this transaction for additional information about our investment in orbitz see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  in march 2005 we exchanged 176 million principal amount of enhanced equipment trust certificates due in 2005 for a like aggregate principal amount of enhanced equipment trust certificates due in 2006 and 2008 for additional information about this transaction see note 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  for additional information about financing and other transactions affecting liquidity see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our liquidity position see the “business environment” section above 

   to preserve liquidity we have taken the following actions regarding our orders for mainline aircraft 

   our longterm plan is to reduce our mainline aircraft fleet by up to four fleet types over approximately the next four years during 2005 we expect to retire 24 mainline aircraft 21 b737300 and b737200 aircraft and three b767200 aircraft these retirements will not have a material impact on our 2005 consolidated financial statements 

  we have additional aircraft commitments that are discussed below in “contractual obligations” for additional information about our aircraft order commitments see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

   shareowners’ deficit was 58 billion at december 31 2004 and 659 million at december 31 2003 the increase in our shareowners’ deficit is primarily due to our 52 billion net loss in 2004 which includes a 19 billion goodwill impairment charge and a 12 billion income tax provision to reserve substantially all of our net deferred tax assets for additional information about the goodwill impairment and valuation allowance see notes 5 and 9 respectively of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

   delaware law provides that a company may pay dividends on its stock only 1 out of its “surplus” which is generally defined as the excess of a company’s net assets over the aggregate par value of its issued stock or 2 from its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is paid or from its net profits for the preceding fiscal year delaware law also prohibits a company from redeeming or purchasing its stock for cash or other property unless the company has sufficient “surplus” 

  because we expected to have and did in fact have a negative “surplus” at december 31 2003 our board of directors took the following actions effective in december 2003 related to our esop preferred stock to comply with delaware law 

 37    at december 31 2004 approximately 5 million shares of esop preferred stock were held by the savings plan about 4 million shares of esop preferred stock are currently allocated to the accounts of savings plan participants the remainder of the shares is available for allocation in the future 

  we are generally required to redeem shares of esop preferred stock 1 to provide for distributions of the accounts of savings plan participants who terminate employment with us and request a distribution and 2 to implement annual diversification elections by savings plan participants who are at least age 55 and have participated in the savings plan for at least ten years in these circumstances shares of esop preferred stock are redeemable at a price “redemption price” equal to the greater of 1 7200 per share or 2 the fair value of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the esop preferred stock to be redeemed plus in either case accrued but unpaid dividends on the shares of esop preferred stock to be redeemed each share of esop convertible preferred stock is convertible into 17155 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 

  under the terms of the esop preferred stock we may pay the redemption price in cash shares of our common stock valued at fair value or in a combination thereof as discussed above since december 2003 we have been using shares of our common stock to pay the redemption price when we are required to redeem esop preferred stock during 2004 we issued 6330551 shares of our common stock to redeem approximately 422000 shares of esop preferred stock under the savings plan we cannot reasonably estimate future issuances of common stock for this purpose due to the various factors that would affect such an estimate including the duration of the period during which we may not redeem esop preferred stock for cash under delaware law the fair value of delta common stock when esop preferred stock is redeemed and the number of shares of esop preferred stock redeemed by savings plan participants who terminate their employment with us or elect to diversify their savings plan accounts 

  for additional information about our esop preferred stock see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

   as of december 31 2004 we had negative working capital of 23 billion compared to negative working capital of 16 billion at december 31 2003 this change in our negative working capital balance is primarily due to the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents which is discussed above in “sources and uses of cash” 

   our senior unsecured longterm debt is rated ca by moody’s investors service inc cc by standard and poor’s rating services and c by fitch ratings moody’s and fitch have stated that their ratings outlook for our senior unsecured debt is negative while standard  poor’s has stated its outlook is positive watch our credit ratings may be lowered further or withdrawn while we do not have debt obligations that accelerate as a result of a credit ratings downgrade our credit ratings have negatively impacted our ability to issue unsecured debt renew outstanding letters of credit that back certain of our obligations and obtain certain financial instruments that we use in our fuel hedging program our credit ratings have also increased the cost of our financing transactions and the amount of collateral required for certain financial instruments insurance coverage and vendor agreements to the extent we are unable to access the capital markets or our financing costs continue to increase including as a result of further credit ratings downgrades our business financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted subsequent to december 31 2004 our collateral requirements related to our workers’ compensation insurance increased by approximately 35 million 

   the ge commercial finance facility includes affirmative negative and financial covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations including our ability to among other things incur or secure other debt make investments sell assets pay dividends or repurchase stock and make capital expenditures the amex facilities also contain affirmative negative and financial covenants substantially the same as those found in the ge commercial finance facility 

  the financial covenants require us to 

   at december 31 2004 we were in compliance with our financial covenants although under our business plan we expect to be in compliance with these covenants in 2005 we do not expect to exceed by a significant margin the requirements that we 1 maintain specified levels of cash and cash equivalents or 2 achieve certain levels of ebitdar if we are unable to comply with these covenants the outstanding borrowings under our financing agreements with ge commercial finance and amex could become immediately due and payable for additional information concerning our covenants see the ge commercial finance facility incorporated as exhibit 105 to this form 10k 

  our reimbursement agreement with gecc includes a collateral value test which is not applicable until may 2006 for additional information about this test and our financing agreements see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  as is customary in the airline industry our aircraft lease and financing agreements require that we maintain certain levels of insurance coverage including warrisk insurance we were in compliance with these requirements at december 31 2004 and 2003 for additional information about our warrisk insurance currently provided by the us government see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  for additional information on our liquidity see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis in this form 10k 

prior years 

  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 27 billion at december 31 2003 net cash provided by operations totaled 142 million during 2003 including net tax refunds totaling 402 million capital expenditures including aircraft acquisitions under sellerfinancing arrangements were 15 billion during 2003 this included the acquisition of 31 crj200 and 20 crj700 aircraft debt and capital lease obligations 

39 including current maturities and shortterm obligations totaled 126 billion at december 31 2003 we issued 19 billion of secured longterm debt during 2003 

  cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 20 billion at december 31 2002 net cash provided by operations totaled 225 million during 2002 including receipt of 1 a 472 million tax refund due to a new tax law and 2 112 million in compensation under the stabilization act capital expenditures including aircraft acquisitions made under sellerfinancing arrangements were 20 billion during 2002 this included the acquisition of four b737800 three b767400 one b777200 34 crj200 and 15 crj700 aircraft debt and capital lease obligations including current maturities and shortterm obligations totaled 109 billion at december 31 2002 we issued 26 billion of secured longterm debt during 2002 

financial position 

december 31 2004 compared to december 31 2003 

  this section discusses certain changes in our consolidated balance sheets which are not otherwise discussed in this form 10k 

  prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by 10 or 49 million primarily reflecting an increase in prepaid aircraft fuel from higher fuel costs and increased prepayment requirements flight and ground equipment under capital leases net of accumulated amortization increased 243 million primarily due to the renegotiation of certain operating leases that are now classified as capital leases in accordance with sfas 13 “accounting for leases” due to the amendment of certain lease terms see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements restricted investments for our boston airport terminal project decreased 56 or 159 million due primarily to the reimbursement of project expenditures during 2004 

  accounts payable deferred credits and other accrued liabilities decreased 9 or 149 million primarily reflecting a decrease in trade accounts payable from increased prepayment requirements in 2004 air traffic liability increased 20 from 2003 primarily due to 1 stronger advance sales from increased capacity and 2 growth in codeshare operations accrued salaries and related benefits decreased 10 due primarily to 1 a lower vacation accrual at the end of 2004 due to changes in our salary rates as part of our transformation plan and 2 salary rate decreases that occurred in the december 2004 quarter primarily related to our new pilot collective bargaining agreement that was effective december 1 2004 

contractual obligations 

  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 related to debt operating leases aircraft order commitments capital leases contract carrier obligations interest and related payments other material noncancelable purchase obligations and other liabilities the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time some of these excluded commitments are discussed in footnote 9 to this table and in the text immediately following that footnote 

 40 

   the following items are not included in the table above 

  pension funding estimates of the amount and timing of future funding obligations under our pension plans are based on various assumptions these include assumptions concerning among other things the actual and projected market performance of the plan assets 30year us treasury bond yields statutory requirements and demographic data for pension plan participants 

  we estimate that our pension plan funding will be approximately 450 million for 2005 our anticipated funding obligations under our pension plans for 2006 and thereafter vary materially depending on the assumptions used to determine these funding obligations including potential legislative changes regarding these obligations absent the enactment of new federal legislation which reduces our pension funding obligations 

41 during the next several years our annual pension funding obligations for each of 2006 through 2009 will be significantly higher than in 2005 and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 

  contract carriers we have longterm contract carrier agreements with three regional air carriers skywest chautauqua and republic airline under these agreements skywest and chautauqua operate certain of their aircraft using our flight code and we schedule those aircraft sell the seats on those flights and retain the related revenues we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on an annual determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services republic airline will begin operating certain of their aircraft using our flight code in july 2005 

  we expect to incur expenses of approximately 10 billion in 2005 under our contract carrier agreements which includes 79 million in the table above under our contract carrier agreement with chautauqua under the chautauqua agreement we are obligated to pay certain minimum fixed obligations the remaining estimated expenses are not included in the table above because these expenses are contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier flights by those air carriers as well as rates that are unknown at this time we cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expenses under the contract carrier agreements in 2006 and thereafter except for the minimum obligations under the chautauqua agreement included in the table above 

  in april 2004 we notified flyi inc “flyi” another regional air carrier that previously operated certain of their aircraft using our flight code of our election to terminate its contract carrier agreement due to flyi’s decision to operate a new lowfare airline using jet aircraft with more than 70 seats flyi ceased operating delta connection flights in november 2004 flyi exercised its right to require us to assume the leases on the 30 fairchild dornier frj328 regional jet aircraft that it operated for us we are currently conducting inspections of these aircraft after we complete the inspections we expect to assume these leases we estimate that the total remaining lease payments on these 30 aircraft leases will be approximately 275 million these lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the aircraft leases which are approximately 13 years we are evaluating our options for utilizing these 30 aircraft including having another air carrier operate these aircraft for us under the delta connection carrier program there are no residual value guarantees related to these leases 

  if we assume the leases for the 30 frj328 aircraft as currently in effect a flyi bankruptcy or insolvency or with respect to certain of the leases a flyi default under various contracts including leases loans and purchase contracts having a value or amount in excess of 15 million would constitute an event of default if an event of default were to occur the financing parties could exercise one or more remedies including the right to require us to purchase the aircraft at a purchase price stipulated in the applicable lease at march 1 2005 the purchase price for each aircraft was approximately 9 million which we estimate exceeds the current market value of each aircraft by approximately 3 million our estimate of the current market value of these aircraft is based on published industry data we cannot determine the likelihood of the occurrence of an event relating to flyi that would constitute an event of default under the leases or the likelihood of the financing parties seeking to exercise certain remedies against us if such an event of default were to occur 

  flyi has stated that as part of its restructuring effort it has secured commitments from certain of the financing parties that upon our assumption of the leases such parties will effectively release flyi from its future obligations to such financing parties under the leases we are in discussions with the financing parties to restructure these leases so that events relating to flyi would not constitute an event of default after we assume the leases 

  we may terminate certain of our contract carrier agreements without cause which may require us to assume the leases or purchase the aircraft the contract carrier operates for us for additional information regarding our contract carrier agreements including our obligations if we elect to terminate certain agreements without cause see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  gecc aircraft in november 2004 as a condition to availability of the ge commercial finance facility we granted gecc the right exercisable until november 2 2005 to lease to us or at our option subject to certain conditions certain delta connection carriers up to 12 crj200 aircraft then leased to another airline subsequent to december 31 2004 gecc exercised this right with respect to eight crj200 aircraft the lease terms for these eight aircraft begin throughout 2005 and have terms of 138 to 168 months we estimate that our 

42 total lease payments for these eight aircraft will be approximately 130 million during the next 14 years additionally the lease rates we will pay for these aircraft approximate current market rates we expect to use these aircraft in our operations 

  redemptions of esop preferred stock as discussed above we changed the form of payment we will use to redeem shares of esop preferred stock when redemptions are required under the savings plan for the indefinite future we will pay the redemption price of the esop preferred stock in shares of our common stock rather than in cash for additional information about our esop preferred stock see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  legal contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business we are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements management believes that the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  other contingent obligations under contracts in addition to the contractual obligations discussed above we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment as defined by each respective contract if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date these obligations are contingent upon whether we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date therefore no obligation would exist unless such a termination were to occur 

  subsequent to december 31 2004 we entered into an agreement to outsource certain human resources services under this agreement we expect to pay a total of approximately 120 million over the next seven years on a declining scale with our largest annual obligation totaling approximately 20 million to be paid in 2005 this agreement is subject to certain termination provisions 

  for additional information about other contingencies not discussed above as well as discussions related to general indemnifications see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 critical accounting estimates 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

  rules proposed by the securities and exchange commission would require disclosures related to accounting estimates management makes in applying accounting policies and the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial statements these proposed rules define critical accounting estimates as those accounting estimates which 1 require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 would have resulted in material changes to our consolidated financial statements if different estimates which we reasonably could have used were made our critical accounting estimates are briefly described below 

  goodwill sfas 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets including when and how to perform impairment tests of recorded balances we have three reporting units that have assigned goodwill mainline asa and comair quoted stock market prices are not available for these individual reporting units accordingly consistent with sfas 142 our methodology for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers projected future cash flows in applying this methodology we 1 make assumptions about each reporting unit’s future cash flows based on capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs and other relevant factors and 2 discount those cash flows based on each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated 

43 financial statements the annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is december 31 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december 31 2004 with the assistance of an independent valuation firm to determine the fair value of our three reporting units as a result of our 2004 annual goodwill impairment tests we recorded a 19 billion charge to write off all goodwill related to the asa and comair reporting units this charge is recorded in impairment of intangible assets on our 2004 consolidated statement of operations for additional information about our accounting policy related to goodwill and other intangibles and the impairment charge we recorded in 2004 see notes 1 and 5 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  impairment of longlived assets we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts the amount of impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the estimated fair values 

  in order to evaluate potential impairment as required by sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we group assets at the fleet type level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on assumptions involving projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors in the markets in which these aircraft operate aircraft fair values are estimated by management using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of longlived assets see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  income tax valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things the overall business environment our historical earnings including our significant pretax losses incurred during the last four years our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and our outlook for future years 

  during 2004 we recorded an additional valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets which resulted in a 12 billion charge to income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations we recorded this additional valuation allowance because we determined that it is unclear as to the timing of when we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets in addition we will no longer recognize the tax benefit of current period losses for the foreseeable future for additional information about income taxes see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans “plans” for eligible employees and retirees the impact of the plans on our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2004 and 2003 and for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is presented in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we currently estimate that our defined benefit pension expense in 2005 will be approximately 440 million the effect of our plans on our consolidated financial statements is subject to many assumptions we believe the most critical assumptions are 1 the weighted average discount rate 2 the rate of increase in future compensation levels and 3 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

  we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments adjusting our discount rate 600 at september 30 2004 by 05 would change our accrued pension cost by approximately 750 million at december 31 2004 and change our estimated pension expense in 2005 by approximately 40 million 

  our rate of increase in future compensation levels is based primarily on labor contracts currently in effect with our employees under collective bargaining agreements and expected future pay rate increases for other employees adjusting our estimated rate of increase in future compensation levels 128 at september 30 2004 by 05 would not significantly change our estimated pension expense in 2005 due primarily to recent employee pay reductions 

44   the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets is based primarily on planspecific assetliability investment studies performed by outside consultants and recent and historical returns on our plans’ assets adjusting our expected longterm rate of return 900 at september 30 2004 by 05 would change our estimated pension expense in 2005 by approximately 35 million for additional information about our pension plans see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” this standard replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” it requires that the compensation cost of sharebased payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued this statement is effective for us beginning july 1 2005 we are evaluating the impact of sfas 123r including the transition options for adoption of this standard on our 2005 consolidated financial statements this impact may be material as we issued approximately 71 million stock options in 2004 primarily under our new broadbased employee stock option plans see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

market risks associated with financial instruments 

  we have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements management expects adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under sfas 133 to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and shareowners’ deficit 

  the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or additional actions by management to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results 

aircraft fuel price risk 

  our results of operations may be significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel to manage this risk we periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our projected annual aircraft fuel requirements heating and crude oil prices have a highly correlated relationship to fuel prices making these derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of aircraft fuel we do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes at december 31 2004 we had no hedges or contractual arrangements that would reduce our fuel costs below market prices 

  as discussed above in this item 7 our aircraft fuel expense rose 51 or 986 million in 2004 compared to 2003 with approximately 820 million of the increase resulting from higher fuel prices during 2004 aircraft fuel accounted for 16 of our total operating expenses our business plan assumes that in 2005 our aircraft fuel consumption will be approximately 27 billion gallons and that our average annual jet fuel price per gallon will be approximately 122 based on these assumptions a 10 rise in our assumed average annual jet fuel price would increase our aircraft fuel expense by approximately 325 million in 2005 

  for additional information regarding our aircraft fuel price risk management program see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

  our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations 

  market risk associated with our fixedrate longterm debt is the potential change in fair value resulting from a change in interest rates a 10 decrease in average annual interest rates would have increased the estimated 

45 fair value of our longterm debt by 16 billion at december 31 2004 and 682 million at december 31 2003 a 10 increase in average annual interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest expense in 2005 at december 31 2004 we had no interest rate swaps or contractual arrangements that would reduce our interest expense for additional information on our longterm debt agreements see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

changes in internal control 

  during the three months ended december 31 2004 we made no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate 

  management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 using the criteria issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control — integrated framework  based on that evaluation management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2004 

  management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm which also audited our consolidated financial statements deloitte  touche llp’s attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting is set forth below 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

   we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that delta air lines inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 and our report dated march 9 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph concerning matters that raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern

airline operations an important characteristic of our route network is our hub airports in atlanta cincinnati dallasfort worth and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes delta flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs our hub and spoke system also provides passengers with access to our principal international gateways in atlanta and new york — john f kennedy international airport “jfk” as briefly discussed below other key characteristics of our route network include our alliances with foreign airlines the delta connection program the delta shuttle song™ our lowfare service and our marketing alliance with continental airlines inc “continental” and northwest airlines inc “northwest” international alliances we have formed bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to international markets these arrangements can include codesharing frequent flyer benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint promotions and other marketing agreements 2 our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under codesharing arrangements we and the foreign carriers publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on the foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our “dl” designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s twoletter designator code as of march 1 2004 we have codeshare arrangements in effect with aerolitoral aeromexico air france and certain of air france’s affiliated carriers operating flights beyond paris air jamaica alitalia avianca british european china airlines china southern csa czech airlines el al israel airlines korean air royal air maroc and south african airways delta aeromexico air france alitalia csa czech airlines and korean air are members of the skyteam international airline alliance skyteam links the route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations in 2002 we our european skyteam partners and korean air received limited antitrust immunity from the us department of transportation “dot” the grant of antitrust immunity enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales marketing and discount programs for customers delta connection program the delta connection program is our regional carrier service which feeds traffic to our route system through contracts with regional air carriers that operate flights serving passengers primarily in small and mediumsized cities the program enables us to increase the number of flights in certain locations to better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets our delta connection network operates the largest number of regional jets in the united states we have contractual arrangements with six regional carriers to operate regional jet and turboprop aircraft using our “dl” code asa and comair are our whollyowned subsidiaries which operate all of their flights under our code we also have agreements with atlantic coast airlines “aca” skywest airlines inc “skywest” chautauqua airlines inc “chautauqua” and american eagle airlines inc “eagle” which operate some of their flights using our code for information regarding our agreements with aca skywest and chautauqua see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements our contract with eagle which is limited to certain flights operated to and from the los angeles international airport as well as a portion of our skywest agreement are structured as revenue proration agreements these prorate arrangements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries delta shuttle the delta shuttle is our high frequency service targeted to northeast business travelers it provides nonstop hourly service between new york  laguardia airport 3 “laguardia” marine air terminal and both boston — logan international airport “logan” and washington dc — ronald reagan national airport “national” song on april 15 2003 we introduced a new lowfare operation song that primarily offers flights between cities in the northeastern united states los angeles las vegas and florida leisure destinations as of march 1 2004 song offered 144 daily flights using a fleet of 36 boeing 757 aircraft song is intended to assist us in competing more effectively with lowcost carriers in leisure markets through a combination of larger aircraft high frequency flights advanced inflight entertainment technology and innovative product offerings deltacontinentalnorthwest marketing alliance we have entered into a marketing alliance with continental and northwest which includes mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements our marketing relationship with continental and northwest is designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the three carriers’ route networks 

regulatory matters the dot and the federal aviation administration “faa” exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the united states the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier that the dot finds “fit” to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for constraints imposed by essential air service regulations which are applicable to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices or methods of competition advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers the faa has primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier flight operations including airline operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements are regulated by the dot and by the foreign governments involved international route awards are also subject to the approval of the president of the united states for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives the transportation security administration which became a division of the department of homeland security on march 1 2003 is responsible for certain civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at us airports we are also subject to various other federal state local and foreign laws and regulations the department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us 4 postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by various federal state local and foreign governmental entities privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate 

fares and rates airlines are permitted to set ticket prices in most domestic and international city pairs without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the foreign countries involved most of our tickets are sold by travel agents and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel agents brokers and wholesalers 

route authority our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and to a limited extent by exemptions issued by the dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are provided by bilateral agreements with or permits or approvals issued by foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the united states and the foreign country or countries involved changes in united states or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations bilateral agreements between the united states and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time certain of our international route and codesharing authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements we request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service there is no assurance of this result dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier indicates a willingness to provide service 

competition we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers some of which have substantially lower costs than we do and provide service at lower fares to destinations served by us we also compete with allcargo carriers charter airlines regional jet operators and particularly on our shorter routes surface transportation the continuing growth of lowcost carriers including southwest airlines co “southwest” airtran airways inc “airtran” and jetblue airways corporation “jetblue” in the united states places significant competitive pressures on us and other network carriers 5 our ability to compete effectively with lowcost carriers and other airlines depends in part on our ability to achieve operating costs per available seat mile “unit costs” that are competitive with those carriers our unit costs are significantly higher than those of southwest airtran and jetblue and have gone from being among the lowest of the hubandspoke carriers to among the highest for the full year 2003 if we are not able to realign our cost structure to compete with that of other carriers or if fare reductions are not offset by higher yields our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers including the star alliance among united airlines inc “united” lufthansa german airlines and others and the oneworld alliance among amr corporation “american” british airways and others have significantly increased competition in international markets through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond european cities through alliances with international carriers we regularly monitor competitive developments in the airline industry and evaluate our strategic alternatives these strategic alternatives include among other things internal growth codesharing arrangements marketing alliances joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions our evaluations involve internal analysis and where appropriate discussions with third parties 

airport access operations at three major us airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through “slot” allocations each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period in the united states the faa currently regulates slot allocations at jfk and laguardia in new york and national in washington dc our operations at those three airports generally require slot allocations under legislation enacted by congress slot rules will be phased out at jfk and laguardia by 2007 we currently have sufficient slot authorizations to operate our existing flights and have generally been able to obtain slots to expand our operations and to change our schedules there is no assurance however that we will be able to obtain slots for these purposes in the future because among other reasons slot allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies 6 

possible legislation or dot regulation a number of congressional bills and proposed dot regulations have been considered in recent years to address airline competition issues some of these proposals would require large airlines with major operations at certain airports to divest or make available to other airlines slots gates facilities and other assets at those airports other measures would limit the service or pricing responses of major carriers that appear to target new entrant airlines in addition concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the dot and faa to consider various proposals for access to certain airports including “congestionbased” landing fees and programs that would withdraw slots from existing carriers and reallocate those slots either by lottery or auction to the highest bidder or to carriers with little or no current presence at such airports these proposals if enacted could negatively impact our existing services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines 

worldspan in june 2003 we sold our equity interest in worldspan lp which operates and markets a computer reservation system for the travel industry for additional information concerning this sale see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

orbitz orbitz inc “orbitz” operates an online travel agency that offers travel services to consumers and business customers via the internet during december 2003 orbitz completed its initial public offering and the founding airlines of orbitz including us sold a portion of their orbitz shares as of march 1 2004 we owned approximately 13 of orbitz american continental northwest and united also hold ownership interests in orbitz for additional information concerning our sale of a portion of our interest in orbitz see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements consumers use online travel agents for making reservations and purchasing airline tickets hotel rooms rental cars and travelrelated products the three largest online travel agents in the united states are expedia travelocity and orbitz online travel agents compete with one another with airline websites with traditional travel agents and with other travel service providers for travelrelated reservations and bookings 7 

fuel our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 20012003   aircraft fuel expense increased 15 in 2003 compared to 2002 total gallons consumed decreased 6 mainly due to capacity reductions the average fuel price per gallon rose 22 to 8178¢ as compared to 2002 our fuel cost is shown net of fuel hedge gains of 152 million for 2003 136 million for 2002 and 299 million for 2001 approximately 65 56 and 58 of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively in february 2004 we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their scheduled settlement dates for more information concerning the settlement of our fuel hedge contracts see note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price to attempt to reduce our exposure to changes in fuel prices we periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative contracts information regarding our fuel hedging program is set forth under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—market risks associated with financial instruments—aircraft fuel price risk” and in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 8 

employee matters railway labor act our relations with labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the national mediation board “nmb” an application alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the dispute and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class under the nmb’s usual rules a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of those employees vote for union representation under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date either party may request the nmb to appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding arbitration a 30day “cooling off” period begins at the end of this 30day period the parties may engage in “self help” unless the president of the united states appoints a presidential emergency board “peb” to investigate and report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period the parties may then engage in “self help” “self help” includes among other things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation which among other things imposes a settlement on the parties collective bargaining at december 31 2003 we had a total of approximately 70600 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 18 of these employees are represented by unions the following table presents certain information concerning the union representation of our domestic employees 9  asa is in collective bargaining negotiations with the air line pilots association international “alpa” which represents asa’s approximately 1450 pilots and with the association of flight attendants “afa” which represents asa’s approximately 800 flight attendants the outcome of these collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined labor unions are engaged in organizing efforts to represent various groups of employees of us asa and comair who are not represented for collective bargaining purposes the outcome of these organizing efforts cannot presently be determined pilot furloughs the collective bargaining agreement with alpa the union representing delta’s pilots generally provides that no pilot on the seniority list as of july 1 2001 will be furloughed unless the furlough is caused by a circumstance beyond our control as defined in that agreement in april 2002 an arbitrator upheld our right to furlough up to 1400 pilots on the basis that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting reduction in passenger traffic constituted a circumstance beyond our control as set out in the collective bargaining agreement the arbitrator retained jurisdiction over this matter to consider any issues that might arise regarding our plans to continue the furloughs or our obligation to implement reasonable mechanisms for recalling furloughed pilots if the conditions existing as of september 11 2001 were ameliorated to an extent that exceeded our original expectations on february 13 2003 the arbitrator issued a supplemental opinion ruling 1 that furloughs will be capped at 1060 the number of pilots currently furloughed 2 that we will not have to begin recalling any of the existing furloughed pilots until system traffic exceeds preseptember 11 2001 levels and 3 that the recall schedule will be subject to our training capacity while this ruling will result in the retention of some pilots in excess of our needs we believe the ruling will not have a material adverse effect on us 10 

environmental matters the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the “anca” recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system it generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past our operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread on december 1 2003 the faa published a notice of proposed rulemaking “nprm” to adopt the international civil aviation organization’s “icao” chapter 4 noise standard which is known as the stage 4 standard in the united states this standard would require that all new commercial jet aircraft designs certified on or after january 1 2006 be at least ten decibels quieter than the existing stage 3 noise standard requires this new standard would not apply to existing aircraft or to the continued production of aircraft types already certified comments on the nprm are due on march 1 2004 all new aircraft that we have on order will meet the proposed stage 4 standard accordingly the proposed rule is not expected to have any significant impact on us and we and the us airline industry are likely to support the adoption of the nprm the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions our aircraft comply with the applicable epa standards the epa has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to adopt the emissions control standards for aircraft engines previously adopted by the icao these standards would apply to newly designed engines certified after december 31 2003 and would align the us aircraft engine emission standards with existing international standards the rule as proposed is not expected to have a material impact on us air carriers the epa the faa and local and state regulators are evaluating potential options for emission reductions from airport activities including aircraft engine emissions reductions and alternativefueled ground service equipment but no conclusion or agreement has been reached additionally we have agreed to reduce emissions at certain airports by utilizing alternativefueled ground service equipment in april 2001 miamidade county filed a lawsuit which is titled miamidade county florida v advance cargo services inc et al in florida circuit court against 17 defendants including us alleging responsibility for past and future environmental cleanup costs and civil penalties for environmental conditions at miami international airport the county also provided notice to over 200 other potentially responsible parties seeking to recover past and future cleanup costs the county is continuing to investigate and remediate various environmental conditions at the airport at this time it is not possible to reasonably estimate our potential exposure in this matter due to a number of issues including uncertainties regarding the contamination at the airport the extent of remediation required and the county’s potential recovery from responsible parties we are vigorously defending the lawsuit 11 we have been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party a “prp” with respect to certain superfund sites and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of these sites our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at each site we are aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this contamination we have a program in place to investigate and if appropriate remediate these sites although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer program we have a frequent flyer program the skymiles® program offering incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows participants to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta connection carriers and participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by program partners such as credit card companies hotels car rental agencies telecommunication services and internet services in addition we have programs under which individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits we reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on delta and participating airline partners for membership in our crown room club and for other program partner awards travel awards are subject to certain transfer restrictions and capacitycontrolled seating in some cases blackout dates may apply miles earned prior to may 1 1995 do not expire so long as we have a frequent flyer program miles earned or purchased on or after may 1 1995 will not expire as long as at least once every three years the participant 1 takes a qualifying flight on delta or a delta connection carrier 2 earns miles through one of our program partners or 3 redeems miles for any program award we account for our frequent flyer program obligations by recording a liability for the estimated incremental cost of travel awards we expect to be redeemed the estimated incremental cost associated with a travel award does not include any contribution to overhead or profit such incremental cost is based on our system average cost per passenger for fuel food and other direct passenger costs we do not record a liability for mileage earned by participants who have not reached the level to become eligible for a free travel award we believe this is appropriate because the large majority of these participants are not expected to earn a travel award we do not record a liability for the expected redemption of miles for nontravel awards since the cost of these awards to us is negligible we estimated the potential number of roundtrip travel awards outstanding under our frequent flyer program to be 143 million 137 million and 131 million at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively of these travel awards we expected that approximately 104 million 100 million and 96 million respectively would be redeemed at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 we had recorded a liability for these awards of 229 million 228 million and 226 million respectively the difference between the roundtrip awards outstanding and the 12 awards expected to be redeemed is the estimate based on historical data of awards which will 1 never be redeemed or 2 be redeemed for something other than award travel frequent flyer program participants flew 28 million 28 million and 24 million award roundtrips on delta in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these roundtrips accounted for approximately 9 9 and 8 of the total passenger miles flown for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively we believe that the relatively low percentage of passenger miles flown by skymiles members traveling on program awards and the restrictions applied to travel awards minimize the displacement of revenue passengers 

civil reserve air fleet program we participate in the civil reserve air fleet “craf” program which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or times of war we have agreed to make available under the craf program during the period october 1 2003 through september 30 2004 up to 100 of our international range aircraft as of march 1 2004 the following numbers of our aircraft are available for craf activation  the craf program has only been activated twice both times at the stage i level since it was created in 1951 

executive officers of the registrant certain information concerning our executive officers follows unless otherwise indicated all positions shown are with delta there are no family relationships between any of our executive officers delta announced on march 12 2004 that president and chief operating officer frederick w reid will retire from the company effective april 1 2004  13  14  

risk factors relating to the airline industry and delta the airline industry has changed fundamentally since the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and our business financial condition and operating results have been materially adversely affected 

since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the airline industry has experienced fundamental and lasting changes including substantial revenue declines and cost increases which have resulted in industrywide liquidity issues the terrorist attacks significantly reduced the demand for air travel and additional terrorist activity involving the airline industry could have an equal or greater impact additionally during 2003 the industry’s financial results were negatively impacted by the military action in iraq and the severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” outbreak although global economic conditions have improved from their depressed levels after september 11 2001 the airline industry has continued to experience a reduction in highyield business travel and increased price sensitivity in customers’ purchasing behavior the airline industry has continued to add or restore capacity despite these conditions we expect all of these events will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results bankruptcies and other restructuring efforts by our competitors have put us at a competitive disadvantage 

since september 11 2001 several air carriers have sought to reorganize under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code including united the secondlargest us air carrier us airways group inc “us airways” the seventhlargest us air carrier and several smaller competitors since filing for chapter 11 on august 11 2002 us airways has emerged from bankruptcy but has recently announced that it is seeking additional cost concessions from its unions additionally american has recently restructured certain labor costs and lowered its operating cost base these reorganizations or restructurings have enabled these competitors to significantly lower their operating costs our unit costs have gone from being among the lowest of the hub and spoke carriers to among the highest for the full year 2003 15 the airline industry is highly competitive and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers some of which have substantially lower costs than we do and provide service at lower fares to destinations served by us our revenues continue to be adversely impacted by the growth of the lowcost carriers with which we compete in most of our markets significant expansion by lowcost carriers to our hub airports could have an adverse impact on our business we also face increasing competition in smaller to mediumsized markets from rapidly expanding regional jet operators in addition we compete with foreign carriers both on interior us routes due to marketing and codesharing arrangements and in international markets if we are not able to realign our cost structure to compete with that of other carriers or if fare reductions are not offset by higher yields our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we continue to experience significant losses without successfully reducing our operating expenses we may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity to provide for our operating needs 

we reported a net loss of 773 million for the year ended december 31 2003 or 640 basic and diluted loss per common share compared to a net loss of 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 or 1044 basic and diluted loss per common share we have recorded a substantial net loss for three consecutive years our revenue and cost challenges are expected to continue for the immediate term and we expect to report a net loss of approximately 400 million for the march 2004 quarter we do not expect significant improvement in the revenue environment in 2004 and expect significant cost pressures related to aircraft fuel pension and interest expenses to continue although we are pursuing profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering our costs and enhancing our revenues these initiatives may not be sufficient furthermore our pilot labor costs are substantially higher than our competitors’ pilot labor costs although we are currently in discussions with alpa in an attempt to reduce our pilot labor costs we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions to the extent that we deplete our cash reserves and are unable to access the capital markets for longterm capital spending requirements or shortterm liquidity needs we will be unable to fund our obligations and sustain our operations our ability to access the capital markets is partially dependent on our credit ratings a further decline in our ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could hinder our ability to operate our business 

our business is highly dependent on our ability to access the capital markets our access to and our costs of borrowing in these markets depend on our credit ratings since september 11 2001 our issuer credit ratings have been lowered to b3 by moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” to b by standard  poor’s rating services “sp” and to b by fitch ratings “fitch” our senior unsecured longterm debt is rated caa2 by moody’s b by sp and b by fitch sp and fitch have each stated that their ratings outlook for our senior unsecured debt is negative while moody’s has stated that its ratings outlook is stable our credit ratings may be lowered further or withdrawn while we do not have debt obligations that accelerate as a result of 16 a credit ratings downgrade our credit ratings have negatively impacted our ability to issue unsecured debt renew outstanding letters of credit that back certain of our obligations and obtain certain financial instruments that we use in our fuel hedging program our credit ratings have also increased the cost of our financing transactions and the amount of collateral required for certain financial instruments insurance coverage and vendor agreements to the extent we are unable to access the capital markets or our financing costs continue to increase including as a result of further credit ratings downgrades our business financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely impacted our pension plan funding obligations are significant and are affected by factors beyond our control 

we sponsor qualified defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees our funding obligations under these plans are governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” we have met our required funding obligations in 2003 for these plans which currently satisfy minimum funding requirements under erisa estimates of the amount and timing of our future funding obligations for the pension plans are based on various assumptions these include assumptions concerning among other things the actual and projected market performance of the pension plan assets 30year us treasury bond yields statutory requirements and demographic data for pension plan participants the amount and timing of our future funding obligations also depend on whether we elect to make contributions to the pension plans in excess of those required under erisa such voluntary contributions may reduce or defer the funding obligations we would have absent those contributions our estimated pension funding of approximately 440 million for 2004 includes 1 a voluntary contribution of 325 million to our nonpilot pension plan the majority of which we made in february 2004 and 2 required contributions totaling approximately 115 million which we will make to our pilot pension plan during the year our anticipated funding obligations under our pension plans for 2005 and thereafter cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because these estimates vary materially depending on the assumptions used to determine them and whether we make contributions in excess of those required nevertheless we presently expect that our funding obligations under our pension plans in each of the years from 2005 through 2008 will be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 

we have now and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and other obligations as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 126 billion of total consolidated indebtedness including capital leases we also have minimum rental commitments with a present value of approximately 8 billion under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could negatively impact our operations in the future for example it could 17  we have significant debt obligations maturing in the near term approximately 10 billion in 2004 and 12 billion in 2005 as adjusted for certain refinancings of regional jet aircraft subsequent to december 31 2003 as well as substantial pension funding obligations we expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash and cash equivalents investments internally generated funds and borrowings we do not have any existing undrawn lines of credit however we have available to us longterm secured financing commitments that we may use only to finance a substantial portion of regional jet aircraft delivered to us through 2004 while we believe that new financing will be available to us access to such financing cannot be assured given the existing business environment and the composition of our currently available unencumbered assets most of our owned aircraft are encumbered and those that are not are less attractive to lenders because they are not eligible for mortgage financing under section 1110 of the us bankruptcy code are older aircraft types andor are aircraft types which are no longer manufactured failure to obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in cincinnati dallasfort worth and salt lake city each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other delta hubs a significant interruption or disruption in service at the atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on our business financial condition and operating results we are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology our business may be adversely affected 

we are increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment for example we have 18 made significant investments in checkin kiosks delta direct phone banks and related initiatives across the system the performance and reliability of our technology is critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively in this challenging business environment we may not be able to continue to make sufficient capital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver these expected benefits in addition any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on such as power telecommunications or internet may disrupt our technology network any individual sustained or repeated failure of our technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs like all companies our technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control including natural disasters terrorist attacks telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers and other security issues while we have in place and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation and new regulations may increase our operating costs 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs for instance the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the faa’s regulations other laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues for example the aviation and transportation security act which became law in november 2001 mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines most of which are funded by a perticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines due to the weak demand and revenue environment this action has negatively impacted our revenues because we have not been able to increase our fares to pass these fees on to our customers furthermore we and other us carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate in addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the united states certain european government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

as a result of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for 19 liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general the us government is providing us airlines with warrisk insurance to cover losses to passengers third parties ground damage and the aircraft hull this coverage extends through august 2004 with a possible extension to december 31 2004 at the discretion of the secretary of transportation but the coverage may not be extended beyond that time we expect that if the us government fails to renew the warrisk insurance that it provides we will be required to replace such coverage commercially or consider other alternatives there can be no assurance that such commercially provided warrisk insurance coverage will be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism or will be provided on terms that will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results our business is dependent on the availability and price of aircraft fuel significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel or periods of high fuel costs would materially adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results can be significantly impacted by changes in the availability or price of aircraft fuel fuel prices increased substantially in 2003 when our average fuel price per gallon rose 22 to approximately 8178¢ as compared to 2002 our fuel costs represented 14 12 and 12 of our operating expenses in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively due to the competitive nature of the airline industry we may not be able to pass on any increases in fuel prices to our customers by increasing our fares furthermore the impact of lower aircraft fuel prices could be offset by increased price competition and a resulting decrease in revenues for all air carriers our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies we purchase most of our aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices we also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price to attempt to reduce our exposure to changes in fuel prices we periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivatives contracts though we may not successfully manage this exposure depending on the type of hedging instrument used our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be limited although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel political disruptions or wars involving oilproducing countries changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future 20 if we experience a significant loss of our senior management and other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected and we may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 

we have approximately 55 officers and we are dependent on their experience and industry knowledge and that of other key employees to execute our business plans if we were to experience a substantial turnover in our leadership our performance could be materially adversely impacted additionally we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect our operations 

our business is labor intensive requiring large numbers of pilots flight attendants mechanics and other personnel approximately 18 of our workforce is unionized strikes or labor disputes with our and our affiliates’ unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the railway labor act which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date our collective bargaining agreement with alpa which represents our pilots becomes amendable on may 1 2005 our whollyowned subsidiary asa is in collective bargaining negotiations with alpa which represents asa’s pilots and with afa which represents asa’s flight attendants the outcome of these collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined in addition to the asa negotiations if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages we are facing significant litigation including litigation arising from the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and if any such significant litigation is concluded in a manner adverse to us our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

we are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business we are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 it appears that the plaintiffs in these september 11 actions are alleging that we and many other air carriers are jointly liable for damages resulting from the terrorist attacks based on a theory of shared responsibility for passenger security screening at logan washington dulles international airport “dulles” and newark liberty international airport “newark” these lawsuits which are in preliminary stages generally seek unspecified damages including punitive damages although federal law limits the financial liability of any air carrier for compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the september 11 terrorist attacks to no more than the limits of liability insurance coverage maintained by the air carrier it is possible that we may be required to pay damages in the event of our insurer’s insolvency or otherwise while we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain of our legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify damages being sought if the outcome of any significant litigation is adverse to us our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely impacted 21 the sars outbreak significantly impacted the airline industry and future disease outbreaks could materially adversely impact our business and operating results 

during the first six months of 2003 the sars outbreak primarily centered in china and other southeast asian countries with a number of cases in toronto canada significantly impacted airline industry revenues due to our small pacific presence the sars outbreak has had only a minimal impact on us however if sars were to spread more widely or if concerns regarding some other disease were to significantly impact customers’ willingness to travel our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely impacted we are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft 

if one of our aircraft were to crash or be involved in an accident we could be exposed to significant tort liability the insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate in the event that our insurance is not adequate we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in addition any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable which could harm our reputation result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business seasonality and other factors impact demand for air travel and our prior performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results 

in general demand for air travel is typically higher in the june and september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year demand for air travel is also affected by factors such as economic conditions war or the threat of war fare levels and weather conditions in addition demand for air travel at particular airlines may be impacted from time to time by among other things actual or threatened disruptions to operations due to labor issues due to these and other factors operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period 22 








 item 2 properties 

flight equipment the table set forth below shows our aircraft fleet at december 31 2003  our purchase commitments firm orders for aircraft as well as options to purchase additional aircraft as of december 31 2003 are shown below  1 in october 2003 we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party to sell 11 b737800 aircraft immediately after those aircraft are delivered to us by the manufacturer in 2005 these 11 b737800 aircraft are included in the above table because we continue to have a contractual obligation to purchase these aircraft from the manufacturer for additional information about our sale agreement see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 23  1 aircraft options have scheduled delivery slots while rolling options replace options and are assigned delivery slots as options expire or are exercised 2 on october 16 2003 boeing announced that it will discontinue production of 757 model aircraft at the end of 2004 we are discussing with boeing the implications of this announcement on our options and rolling options for 757 aircraft after 2004 3 while our agreement with the manufacturer enables us to exercise the options indicated in this table our collective bargaining agreement with alpa limits the number of jet aircraft certificated for operation with between 51 and 70 seats that may be operated by other us carriers including asa and comair using the delta flight code this limit is currently 58 aircraft but potentially could increase in the future depending on certain factors related to the extent of flying performed by delta pilots based on our current fleet and block hour plans we will reach the current limit by the end of 2004 and we are unable to predict when or if that limit will increase our longterm agreement with the boeing company “boeing” covers firm orders options and rolling options for certain aircraft through calendar year 2017 this agreement supports our plan for disciplined growth aircraft rationalization and fleet replacement it also gives us certain flexibility to adjust scheduled aircraft deliveries and to substitute between aircraft models and aircraft types the majority of the aircraft under firm order from boeing will be used to replace older aircraft in october 2003 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell 11 b737800 aircraft to a third party immediately after those aircraft are delivered to us by the manufacturer in 2005 as of december 31 2003 we had deferred delivery of one b737800 aircraft and plan to exercise our right to defer delivery of an additional seven b737800 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2005 until 2008 in february 2004 we announced our intention to seek to sell two b777200 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2005 in conjunction with this announcement we also disclosed our intention to either acquire other boeing aircraft in place of the three b777200 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2006 or to attempt to sell these three aircraft we have no scheduled mainline aircraft deliveries in 2004 our longterm plan is to reduce our mainline aircraft fleet to three family types we believe fleet standardization will improve reliability and produce longterm cost savings consistent with this plan we retired our last b727 aircraft in april 2003 due to weak traffic we temporarily grounded the entire md11 fleet by the end of january 2004 as a result of these actions beginning in 2004 we will operate a mainline fleet composed entirely of twopilot twoengine aircraft our fleet at december 31 2003 includes the following 23 aircraft which have been temporarily grounded 13 md11 five b767200 four b737200 and one b767300er included in our fleet table other fleet activity included the conversion of 36 b757200 aircraft from mainline to song configuration and the sublease of two md11 aircraft to world airways these two aircraft are excluded from our fleet table 24 our regional jet operations offer service to small and mediumsized cities and enable us to supplement mainline frequencies and service to larger cities in 2000 our whollyowned subsidiaries asa and comair entered into agreements with bombardier inc to purchase a total of 94 canadair regional jet “crj” aircraft including 69 crj200 aircraft with a mix of 40 and 50 seats and 25 crj700 aircraft with 70 seats asa and comair also received options to purchase 406 crj aircraft through 2010 at december 31 2003 all 69 crj200 aircraft have been delivered during 2004 all remaining firm crj700 aircraft are scheduled for delivery on february 27 2004 we entered into an agreement to purchase 32 crj200 aircraft to be delivered in 2005 in conjunction with this agreement we entered into a facility with a third party to finance on a secured basis at the time of acquisition the

ground facilities we lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy our largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal offices are located at or near the atlanta airport on land leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases we own a portion of our principal offices our atlanta reservations center and other real property in atlanta as well as a limited number of radio transmitting and receiving sites and certain other facilities we lease ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve these leases generally run for periods of less than one year to thirty years or more and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates at most airports that we serve we have entered into use agreements which provide for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other facilities landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft we also lease aircraft maintenance facilities at certain airports these leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing operating and maintaining such facilities in addition to our atlanta maintenance base our other major aircraft maintenance facilities are located at cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport dallasfort worth international airport and salt lake city international airport we lease marketing ticket and reservations offices in certain major cities that we serve these leases are generally for shorter terms than the airport leases additional information relating to our ground facilities is set forth in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the limitations on such charges 25 are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such charges is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially the city of atlanta with the support of us and other airlines has begun a ten year capital improvement program the “cip” at the atlanta airport implementation of the cip should increase the number of flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays the cip includes among other things a new approximately 9000 foot fullservice runway targeted for completion in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements if fully implemented the cip is currently estimated by the city of atlanta to cost approximately 68 billion which exceeds the 54 billion cip approved by the airlines in 1999 the cip runs through 2010 with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds certain elements of the cip have been delayed and there is no assurance that the cip will be fully implemented failure to implement certain portions of the cip in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at the atlanta airport during 2001 we entered into lease and financing agreements with the massachusetts port authority “massport” for the redevelopment and expansion of terminal a at logan the completion of this project will enable us to consolidate all of our domestic operations at that airport into one location construction began in the june 2002 quarter and is scheduled to be completed during 2005 project costs will be funded with 498 million in proceeds from special facilities revenue bonds issued by massport on august 16 2001 we agreed to pay the debt service on the bonds under a longterm lease agreement with massport and issued a guarantee to the bond trustee covering the payment of the debt service on the bonds additional information about these bonds is set forth in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 


 item 3 legal proceedings in re northwest airlines et al antitrust litigation in june 1999 two purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan against us us airways northwest and the airlines reporting corporation an airlineowned company that operates a centralized clearinghouse for travel agents to report and account for airline ticket sales in the first case the plaintiffs allege among other things 1 that the defendants and certain other airlines conspired with us in violation of section 1 of the sherman act to restrain competition and assist us in fixing and maintaining anticompetitive prices for air passenger service to and from our atlanta and cincinnati hubs and 2 that we violated section 2 of the sherman act by exercising monopoly power to establish such prices in an anticompetitive or exclusionary manner the complaint asserts that for purposes of plaintiffs’ damages claims the purported plaintiff class consists of all persons who purchased a delta fullfare ticket between june 11 1995 and the present on routes 1 that start or end at our hubs in atlanta or cincinnati 26 2 on which we have over a 50 market share 3 that are longer than 150 miles and 4 that have total annual traffic of over 30000 passengers in the second case the plaintiffs assert similar allegations and claims under sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act with respect to us airways’ pricing practices at its pittsburgh and charlotte hubs “us airways hubs” the complaint asserts among other things that we the other defendants and certain other airlines conspired with us airways to restrain competition and assist us airways in fixing and maintaining prices for air passenger service to and from the us airways hubs in both cases plaintiffs have requested a jury trial and are seeking in their complaints injunctive relief costs and attorneys’ fees and unspecified damages to be trebled under the antitrust laws in may 2002 the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class action certification and denied the airlines’ motions for summary judgment the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit refused to hear the airlines’ interlocutory appeal of the district court’s order granting class action certification the trial for this lawsuit has not yet been scheduled hall et al v united airlines et al in january 2002 a travel agent in north carolina filed a class action lawsuit against numerous airlines including us in the us district court for the eastern district of north carolina on behalf of all travel agents in the united states which sold tickets from september 1 1997 to the present on any of the defendant airlines the lawsuit alleges that we and the other airline defendants conspired to fix travel agent commissions in violation of section 1 of the sherman act the plaintiff who has requested a jury trial is seeking in its complaint injunctive relief costs and attorneys’ fees and unspecified damages to be trebled under the antitrust laws in september 2002 the district court granted the plaintiff’s motion for class action certification certifying a class consisting of all travel agents in the united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands which sold tickets on the defendant airlines between 1997 and 2002 on october 30 2003 the district court granted summary judgment against the plaintiff class dismissing all claims asserted against us and most other defendants plaintiffs appealed to the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit similar litigation alleging violations under canadian competition law is pending against us and other airlines in canada all direct travel inc et al v delta air lines et al two travel agencies have filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the us district court for the central district of california on behalf of all travel agencies from which we have demanded payment for breach of the agencies’ contractual and fiduciary duties to us in connection with delta ticket sale transactions during the period from september 20 1997 to the present the lawsuit alleges that our conduct 1 violates the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of 1970 and 2 creates liability for unjust enrichment the plaintiffs who have requested a jury trial are seeking in their complaint injunctive and declaratory relief costs and attorneys’ fees and unspecified treble damages 27 in january 2003 the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class action certification and in april 2003 granted our motion for summary judgment on all claims plaintiffs have appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit power travel international inc et al v american airlines et al in august 2002 a travel agency filed a purported class action lawsuit in new york state court against us american continental northwest united and jetblue on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of us travel agents jetblue has been dismissed from the case and the remaining defendants removed the action to the us district court for the southern district of new york the lawsuit alleges that the defendants breached their contracts with and their duties of good faith and fair dealing to us travel agencies when these airlines discontinued the payment of published base commissions to us travel agencies at various times beginning in march 2002 the plaintiffs’ amended complaint seeks unspecified damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief similar litigation involving contract claims alleged under the agency agreements applicable to canadian travel agents is pending against us and other airlines in canada multidistrict pilot retirement plan litigation during the june 2001 quarter the delta pilots retirement plan “retirement plan” and related nonqualified pilot retirement plans sponsored and funded by us were named as defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in federal district courts in california massachusetts ohio new mexico and new york the complaints 1 seek to assert claims on behalf of a class consisting of certain groups of retired and active delta pilots 2 allege that the calculation of the retirement benefits of the plaintiffs and the class violated the retirement plan and the internal revenue code and 3 seek unspecified damages in october 2001 the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation granted our motion to transfer these cases to the us district court for the northern district of georgia for coordinated pretrial proceedings plaintiffs have filed a motion for class action certification litigation re september 11 terrorist attacks we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 it appears that the plaintiffs in these actions are alleging that we and many other air carriers are jointly liable for damages resulting from the terrorist attacks based on a theory of shared responsibility for passenger security screening at logan dulles and newark these lawsuits which are in preliminary stages generally seek unspecified damages including punitive damages although federal law limits the financial liability of any air carrier for compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the september 11 terrorist attacks to no more than the limits of liability insurance coverage maintained by the air carrier it is possible that we may be required to pay damages in the event of our insurers’ insolvency or otherwise in each of the foregoing cases we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and we are vigorously defending the lawsuits an adverse decision in any of these cases could result in substantial damages against us although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 28 for a discussion of certain

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business environment our net loss was 773 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the third consecutive year we recorded a substantial net loss these financial results reflect the unprecedented challenges confronting us and other airlines since the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the airline industry has experienced a severely depressed revenue environment and significant cost pressures these factors have resulted in industrywide liquidity issues including the restructuring of certain hub and spoke airlines due to bankruptcy or near bankruptcy the continuing impact of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and other events have resulted in fundamental and what we believe will be longterm changes in the airline industry the revenue environment continues to be severely impacted by the following factors  our revenues have also been negatively affected by a passenger security fee imposed by the us government after september 11 2001 which airlines are required to collect from customers and remit to the government due to the depressed revenue environment we have not been able to increase our fares to pass these fees on to our customers although suspended for tickets sold between june 1 2003 and september 30 2003 the passenger security fee was reimposed on october 1 2003 31 due to the changes that have occurred in the airline industry we must significantly reduce our costs in order to be competitive in the current environment and over the longterm our cost structure is materially higher than that of the lowcost airlines with which we compete moreover as mentioned above other hub and spoke airlines such as american airlines united airlines and us airways have significantly reduced their costs through bankruptcy or the threat of bankruptcy our unit costs have gone from being among the lowest of the hub and spoke airlines to among the highest for 2003 a result which places us at a serious competitive disadvantage revenues our operating revenues were 133 billion in 2003 which was unchanged from our operating revenues in 2002 and 4 lower than our operating revenues in 2001 our operating revenue performance in 2003 reflects the depressed revenue environment discussed above during 2003 our and other airlines’ revenues were also negatively impacted by the military action in iraq international traffic particularly in our atlantic region experienced the greatest impact related to the situation in iraq declining 12 for 2003 as compared to the prior year yearoveryear increases in our military charter revenues in 2003 partially offset the negative effect of these events in april 2003 we implemented a 12 reduction in mainline capacity due to the military action in iraq because there has been some improvement in passenger demand since the end of major military combat in iraq in may 2003 we have now restored most of this capacity costs our cost pressures for 2003 compared to 2002 included increases in pension aircraft fuel and interest expense pension and related expense increased approximately 290 million primarily due to declining interest rates a decrease in the fair value of our pension plan assets and scheduled pilot salary increases under the pilots’ collective bargaining agreement aircraft fuel expense rose 255 million mainly due to the rise in fuel prices to historically high levels in the period leading up to the military action in iraq and again during the december 2003 quarter our interest expense increased 86 million largely due to higher levels of debt outstanding based on our substantial increase in borrowings as discussed below we expect these cost pressures to continue during 2004 we estimate that the total annual increase for 2004 compared to 2003 related to aircraft fuel pension and related and interest expense will be approximately 180 million 130 million and 75 million respectively our estimated increase in aircraft fuel expense assumes an average fuel price per gallon in 2004 of approximately 84¢ a 3 increase over 2003 on our projected aircraft fuel consumption of approximately 25 billion gallons salaries and related costs represented 45 and 42 of our total operating expenses for 2003 and 2002 respectively we have taken actions such as workforce reductions and changes in our nonpilot employee benefits to reduce employeerelated costs our pilot cost structure is however significantly higher than our competitors it is critical to reduce our costs in order to be competitive with other airlines we are currently in discussions with alpa to move toward a 32 competitive pilot cost structure but we cannot predict the outcome of these discussions our collective bargaining agreement with alpa becomes amendable on may 1 2005 the us government is providing us airlines with warrisk insurance this coverage extends through august 2004 with a possible extension to december 31 2004 at the discretion of the secretary of transportation if the us government fails to renew this insurance there can be no assurance that commercially provided warrisk insurance coverage will be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism or will be provided on terms that will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations initiatives we implemented a profit improvement initiative program aimed at lowering our costs and increasing our revenues to compete in the current business environment and over the long term our actions under this program have included among other things 1 the transformation of the passenger checkin process to utilize more selfservice options such as automated ticketing kiosks deltadirect phones and checkin via deltacom 2 selling food on flights and changing catering processes 3 new crew scheduling technology for pilots and flight attendants 4 the restructuring of operations at our salt lake city and dallasfort worth hubs and 5 our marketing alliance with continental airlines and northwest airlines while we believe we have made progress under this program we must continue to reduce our costs to compete in the existing business environment at the end of 2003 we began a reassessment of our operating and business strategy the purposes of this review include assessing our competitive effectiveness determining the best use of our available resources and identifying strategic initiatives that we might pursue to improve our performance we expect to complete this review by july 2004 liquidity due to the depressed revenue environment and significant cost pressures we borrowed 22 billion of debt in 2003 the net proceeds of these transactions were primarily used to finance aircraft repay certain debt obligations and increase our liquidity all of these borrowings were secured by aircraft or other assets except for our issuance of 350 million principal amount of 800 convertible senior notes in 2002 and 2001 we borrowed 26 billion and 23 billion respectively of debt all of which was secured by aircraft at december 31 2003 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 27 billion on february 6 2004 we issued 325 million principal amount of 278 convertible senior notes we do not have any undrawn lines of credit however we have available to us longterm secured financing commitments that we may use only to finance a substantial portion of regional jet aircraft delivered to us through 2004 “rj commitments” most of our owned aircraft are encumbered and those that are not are less attractive to lenders because they are not eligible for mortgage financing under section 1110 of the us bankruptcy code are older aircraft types andor are aircraft types which are no longer manufactured substantially all of our spare mainline aircraft engines and a substantial portion of our mainline aircraft spare parts are also encumbered absent factors outside our control we believe that our annual 2004 cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our daily operations including 1 approximately 33 13 billion of operating lease payments 2 approximately 750 million in interest payments which may vary as interest rates change on our 42 billion principal amount of variable rate debt and 3 estimated pension funding of approximately 440 million we also believe that our annual 2004 cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our nonfleet capital expenditures for 2004 but will not be sufficient to pay our aircraft capital expenditures and debt maturities for that year our estimated pension funding of approximately 440 million for 2004 includes 1 a voluntary contribution of 325 million to our nonpilot pension plan the majority of which we made in february 2004 and 2 required contributions totaling approximately 115 million which we will make to our pilot pension plan during the year the voluntary contribution to the nonpilot pension plan will reduce our near term funding obligation for that plan and increase the benefit security for plan participants as a result of the 2004 contributions to our pension plans the nonpilot and pilot pension plans will each have a funded ratio for current liability purposes under erisa of at least 80 as of july 1 2003 our most recent erisa funding measurement date during 2004 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 12 billion covering 600 million for aircraft expenditures which includes approximately 500 million for the acquisition of regional jet aircraft 300 million for aircraft parts and modifications and 300 million for nonfleet capital expenditures we may use the rj commitments to fund a substantial portion of our obligations for the acquisition of regional jet aircraft as discussed above we believe our nonfleet capital expenditures will be funded through cash flows from operations we currently expect to fund the remaining capital expenditures in 2004 through cash and cash equivalents we have approximately 10 billion of debt maturities due during 2004 including 430 million in the march 2004 quarter 160 million in the june 2004 quarter 290 million in the september 2004 quarter and 120 million in the december 2004 quarter these maturities include approximately 300 million due under shortterm financing arrangements associated with our acquisition of regional jet aircraft which will be largely refinanced through the rj commitments we currently expect to pay the remaining debt maturities in 2004 through cash and cash equivalents we have significant obligations due in 2005 and thereafter for additional information see the contractual obligations section of management’s discussion and analysis in this form 10k we expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash and cash equivalents investments internally generated funds and borrowings while new financing may be available to us access to such financing cannot be assured given the existing business environment and the composition of our currently available unencumbered assets failure to obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity outlook based on the continuing weak revenue environment and cost pressures including higher fuel costs we estimate we will record a net loss of approximately 400 million in the march 2004 quarter 34

22 billion in 2003 rpms fell 12 on a capacity decline of 14 while passenger mile yield increased 9 the decline in international revenue passenger miles particularly in the atlantic region is due to the reduction in traffic in the period leading up to and during the military action in iraq the increase in passenger mile yield primarily relates to the reduction of capacity in certain markets and favorable foreign currency exchange rates   cargo and other revenues cargo revenues increased 1 to 464 million in 2003 cargo ton miles decreased 6 due to reductions in capacity while cargo ton mile yield increased 8 other revenues decreased 2 to 516 million primarily reflecting decreases due to lower revenue from certain mileage partnership arrangements as well as a decline in codeshare revenue these decreases were partially offset by an increase in various miscellaneous revenues and growth under our contract carrier arrangements operating expenses operating expenses totaled 141 billion for 2003 decreasing 4 from 2002 operating capacity decreased 5 to 134 billion available seat miles “asm”s primarily due to capacity reductions implemented as a result of the military action in iraq

during 2003 and 2002 and 3 stabilization act compensation recorded in 2002 these items are discussed below salaries and related costs totaled 63 billion in 2003 a 3 increase from 2002 this 3 increase primarily reflects 1 a 5 increase from higher pension and related expense of approximately 290 million 2 a 2 increase due to salary rate increases primarily for pilots in the june 2003 and 2002 quarters under their collective bargaining agreement and for mechanics in the june 2002 quarter and 3 a 2 increase due to growth in our whollyowned subsidiaries’ regional jet operations these increases were partially offset by a 6 decrease due 35 to our 2002 workforce reduction programs the increase in pension expense mainly reflects the impact of declining interest rates a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets and scheduled pilot salary increases partially offset by approximately 120 million in expense reductions from the transition of our nonpilot defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan for additional information related to this transition see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements aircraft fuel expense totaled 19 billion during 2003 a 15 increase from 2002 this increase is primarily due to higher fuel prices partially offset by capacity reductions the average fuel price per gallon rose 22 to 8178¢ while total gallons consumed decreased 6 our fuel cost is shown net of fuel hedge gains of 152 million for 2003 and 136 million for 2002 approximately 65 and 56 of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during 2003 and 2002 respectively for additional information about our fuel hedge contracts see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements depreciation and amortization expense rose 5 in 2003 primarily due to the acquisition of regional jet aircraft and an increase in software amortization associated with completed technology projects contracted services expense declined 12 primarily due to reduced traffic and capacity the suspension of the air carrier security fees under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act “appropriations act” between june 1 2003 and september 30 2003 and a decrease in contracted services across certain workgroups for additional information about the appropriations act see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements landing fees and other rents rose 3 primarily due to higher landing fees adopted by airports seeking to recover lost revenue due to decreased traffic and increased facility rates aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense fell 11 primarily from reduced maintenance volume and materials consumption as a result of process improvement initiatives lower capacity and our fleet simplification program aircraft rent expense increased 3 mainly due to our decision in the december 2002 quarter to return our b737300 leased aircraft to service during 2003 for additional information related to this decision see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements other selling expenses fell 11 this increase primarily reflects a 9 decrease related to lower booking fees resulting from decreased traffic and a 3 decline from higher sales of mileage credits under our skymiles program because a portion of this revenue is recorded as an offset to other selling expenses these decreases were partially offset by an increase in advertising expenses due to the launch of song our new lowfare service passenger commission expense declined 34 primarily reflecting a 22 decrease from the change in our commission rate structure in 2002 which resulted in the elimination of travel agent base commissions for tickets sold in the us and canada the decrease in passenger commissions also reflects the cancellation or renegotiation of certain travel agent contracts and a lower volume of base and incentive commissions passenger service expense decreased 13 primarily reflecting a 10 decline from decreased traffic and capacity and a 7 decrease due to certain meal servicerelated cost savings initiatives 36 restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net

service after the strike aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense fell 11 primarily reflecting a reduction in maintenance volume and materials consumption due to the timing of maintenance events aircraft rent expense decreased 4 primarily due to a reduction in the number of leased aircraft during 2002 from our fleet simplification efforts other selling expenses fell 13 of which 6 was due to lower costs associated with our mileage partnership programs and 4 was due to reduced advertising and promotion spending 39 passenger commission expense declined 40 primarily due to a change in our commission rate structure on march 14 2002 we eliminated travel agent base commissions for tickets sold in the us and canada passenger service expense decreased 20 primarily due to meal service reductions restructuring asset writedowns pension settlements and related items net totaled 439 million in 2002 compared to 11 billion in 2001 our 2002 charge is discussed above our 2001

659 million at december 31 2003 and 893 million at december 31 2002 the decrease in our shareowners’ deficit equity is primarily due to our 773 million net loss in 2003 and the 786 million net of tax noncash adjustment to our additional minimum pension liability recorded during 2003 for further information about our additional minimum pension liability see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated

defined as the excess of a company’s net assets over the aggregate par value of its issued stock or 2 from its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is paid or from its net profits for the preceding fiscal year delaware law also prohibits a company from redeeming or purchasing its stock for cash or other property unless the company has sufficient “surplus” because we expected to have and did in fact have a negative “surplus” at december 31 2003 our board of directors took the following actions effective in december 2003 related to our esop preferred stock to comply with delaware law  at december 31 2003 approximately 58 million shares of esop preferred stock were held by the savings plan about 38 million shares of esop preferred stock are currently allocated to the accounts of savings plan participants the remainder of the shares is available for allocation in the future we are generally required to redeem shares of esop preferred stock 1 to provide for distributions of the accounts of savings plan participants who terminate employment with us and request a distribution and 2 to implement annual diversification elections by savings plan participants who are at least age 55 and have participated in the savings plan for at least ten years in these circumstances shares of esop preferred stock are redeemable at a price equal to the greater of 1 7200 per share or 2 the fair value of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the esop preferred stock to be redeemed plus in either case accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of esop preferred stock under the terms of the esop preferred stock we may pay the redemption price in cash shares of our common stock valued at fair value or in a combination thereof each share of esop convertible preferred stock is convertible into 17155 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment in certain circumstances during 2003 an average of approximately 20000 shares of esop preferred stock was redeemed each month under the savings plan resulting in an average aggregate monthly redemption price of 14 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends at this rate and assuming a delta common stock price of 1200 per share we estimate that we will issue approximately 35 million shares of our common stock during 2004 and 2005 to redeem esop preferred stock the actual number of shares of our common stock issued may differ materially from this estimate because the actual number of shares will depend on various factors including the duration of the period during which we may not redeem esop preferred stock for cash under delaware law 43 the fair value of delta common stock when esop preferred stock is redeemed and the number of shares of esop preferred stock redeemed by savings plan participants who terminate their employment with us or elect to diversify their savings plan accounts for additional information about our esop preferred stock see notes 11 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements working capital position as of december 31 2003 we had negative working capital of 17 billion compared to negative working capital of 26 billion at december 31 2002 this change in our negative working capital balance is primarily due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents which is discussed above in the sources and uses of cash section of management’s discussion and analysis in this form 10k a negative working capital position is normal for us typically due to our air traffic liability and the fact that we primarily generate revenue by providing air transportation through the utilization of property and equipment which are classified as longterm assets credit ratings and covenants since september 11 2001 our issuer credit ratings have been lowered to b3 by moody’s to b by sp and to b by fitch our senior unsecured longterm debt is rated caa2 by moody’s b by sp and b by fitch sp and fitch have each stated that their ratings outlook for our senior unsecured debt is negative while moody’s has stated that its outlook is stable our credit ratings may be lowered further while we do not have debt obligations that accelerate as a result of a credit ratings downgrade our credit ratings have negatively impacted our ability to issue unsecured debt renew outstanding letters of credit that back certain of our obligations and obtain certain financial instruments that we use in our fuel hedging program our credit ratings have also increased the cost of our financing transactions and the amount of collateral required for certain financial instruments insurance coverage and vendor agreements to the extent we are unable to access the capital markets or our financing costs continue to increase including as a result of further credit ratings downgrades our business financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted our credit facilities do not contain any negative financial covenants our reimbursement agreement with gecc includes a collateral value test for additional information about this test see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as is customary in the airline industry our aircraft lease and financing agreements require that we maintain certain levels of insurance coverage including warrisk insurance we were in compliance with these requirements at december 31 2003 and 2002 for additional information about our warrisk insurance currently provided by the us government under the stabilization act see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our liquidity see the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis in this form 10k prior years   2002 cash and cash

financial position december 31 2003 compared to december 31 2002 this section discusses certain changes in our consolidated balance sheets which are not otherwise discussed in this form 10k prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by 34 or 120 million primarily due to an increase in prepaid aircraft fuel as well as an increase in the fair value of our fuel hedge derivative contracts restricted investments for our boston airport terminal project decreased 31 or 131 million due to the capitalization of project expenditures and interest paid other noncurrent assets increased 42 or 634 million due to an increase in our deferred tax assets which was partially offset by a decrease in the intangible asset recorded in conjunction with our additional minimum pension liability accounts payable deferred credits and other accrued liabilities decreased 8 or 162 million primarily due to payments related to our restructuring reserves and to the delta employees credit union see note 16 and note 20 respectively of the notes to the consolidated financial statements pension and related benefits increased 51 or 16 billion primarily due to our noncash adjustments to our additional minimum pension liability recorded during 2003 for additional information on our employee benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 related to debt operating leases aircraft order commitments capital leases interest and related payments other material noncancelable purchase obligations and other liabilities the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on certain events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time 45   the table above does not include amounts related to our future funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans estimates of the amount and timing of these future funding obligations are based on various assumptions these include assumptions concerning among other things the actual and projected market performance of the plan assets 30year us treasury bond yields statutory requirements and demographic data for pension plan participants the amount and timing of our future funding obligations also depend on whether we elect to make contributions to the pension plans in excess of those required under erisa such voluntary contributions may reduce or defer the funding obligations we would have absent those contributions 46 we estimate that our pension plan funding will be approximately 440 million for 2004 as discussed in the business environment section of management’s discussion and analysis in this form 10k this includes a voluntary contribution of 325 million to our nonpilot pension plan in january and february 2004 our anticipated funding obligations under our pension plans for 2005 and thereafter cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because these estimates vary materially depending on the assumptions used to determine them and whether we make contributions in excess of those required nevertheless we presently expect that our funding obligations under our pension plans in each of the years from 2005 through 2008 will be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity in addition to the contractual obligations discussed above we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment as defined by each respective contract if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date these obligations are contingent upon whether we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date therefore no obligation would exist unless such a termination were to occur we are party to a collective bargaining agreement with alpa representing delta pilots the agreement generally provides that no pilot on the seniority list as of july 1 2001 may be furloughed unless the furlough is caused by a circumstance beyond our control as defined in that agreement therefore if we reduce the number of flights in our schedule for reasons other than a circumstance beyond our control as defined in the agreement we may be required to pay unutilized pilots their full salary and benefits if we furlough pilots due to a circumstance beyond our control we are only obligated to remit furlough pay and to provide or pay for certain other benefits for a limited period until the pilots are recalled we have been involved in arbitration regarding whether the agreement permits furloughs in particular circumstances as described in item 1 “business—employee matters—pilot furloughs” of this form 10k our agreement with alpa becomes amendable on may 1 2005 we have longterm contract carrier agreements with three regional air carriers aca skywest and chautanqua under these agreements aca skywest and chautauqua operate certain of their aircraft using our flight code we schedule those aircraft and sell the seats on those flights and we keep the related revenues we pay those airlines an amount as defined in the applicable agreement which is based on an annual redetermination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services we expect to incur expenses of approximately 890 million in 2004 related to our contract carrier agreements with aca skywest and chautauqua these expenses are not included in the table above because they are contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier flights by those air carriers we cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expenses under the contract carrier agreements in 2005 and thereafter for additional information regarding our contract carrier agreements including the possibility that we may be required to assume certain of aca’s regional jet leases see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 47 as discussed above we changed the form of payment we will use to redeem shares of esop preferred stock when redemptions are required under the savings plan for the indefinite future we will pay the redemption price of the esop preferred stock in shares of our common stock rather than in cash for additional information about our esop preferred stock see notes 11 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about other contingencies see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements offbalance sheet arrangements s ale of receivables  we were party to an agreement as amended under which we sold a defined pool of our accounts receivable on a revolving basis through a specialpurpose whollyowned subsidiary to a third party in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” we did not consolidate this subsidiary in our consolidated financial statements this agreement terminated on its scheduled expiration date of march 31 2003 as a result on april 2 2003 we paid 250 million which represented the total amount owed to the third party by the subsidiary and subsequently collected the related receivables for additional information about this agreement see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements other   legal contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters employment practices environmental issues and other matters concerning our business we are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because for example the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought although the ultimate outcome of our legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements application of critical accounting policies   critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates rules proposed by the securities and exchange commission would require disclosures related to accounting estimates management makes in applying accounting policies and the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial statements these rules define critical accounting estimates as those accounting estimates which 1 require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 would have resulted in material changes to our consolidated financial 48 statements if different estimates which we reasonably could have used were made our critical accounting estimates are briefly described below   goodwill  sfas 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets including when and how to perform impairment tests of recorded balances we have three reporting units that have assigned goodwill deltamainline atlantic southeast airlines inc and comair quoted stock market prices are not available for these individual reporting units accordingly consistent with sfas 142 our methodology for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers discounted future cash flows in applying this methodology we 1 make assumptions about each reporting unit’s future cash flows based on capacity yield traffic operating costs and other relevant factors and 2 discount those cash flows based on each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policy related to goodwill and other intangibles see notes 1 and 5 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements   income tax valuation allowance  in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions we consider among other things the overall business environment our historical earnings including our significant pretax losses incurred during the last three years our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and our outlook for future years we performed this analysis as of december 31 2003 and determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized the positive evidence included 1 our expectation that we will report pretax book and taxable income in future years 2 our federal net operating losses “nol“s have never expired unused 3 our alternative minimum tax “amt” credit carryforwards do not expire 4 substantially all of our cumulative nol carryforward at december 31 2003 will not begin to expire until 2022 and 5 given the long economic cycles of this industry our belief that we are not in a cumulative loss position for purposes of assessing recoverability of our net deferred tax assets additionally a significant portion of our deferred tax assets is associated with our additional minimum pension liability over time this liability is required to be funded which will eliminate the related deferred tax asset we will assess the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance on an ongoing basis considering factors such as those mentioned above as well as other relevant criteria changes in the assumptions discussed above may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes see notes 1 and 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements   pension plans  we sponsor defined benefit pension plans “plans” for eligible employees and retirees the impact of the plans on our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2003 and 2002 and for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is presented in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we currently 49 estimate that our defined benefit pension expense in 2004 will be approximately 525 million the effect of our plans on our consolidated financial statements is subject to many assumptions we believe the most critical assumptions are 1 the weighted average discount rate 2 the rate of increase in future compensation levels and 3 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments adjusting our discount rate 6125 at september 30 2003 by 05 would change our accrued pension cost by approximately 780 million at december 31 2003 and change our estimated pension expense in 2004 by approximately 60 million our rate of increase in future compensation levels is based primarily on labor contracts currently in effect with our employees under collective bargaining agreements and expected future pay rate increases for other employees adjusting our estimated rate of increase in future compensation levels 189 at september 30 2003 by 05 would change our estimated pension expense in 2004 by approximately 20 million the expected longterm rate of return on our plan assets is based primarily on planspecific assetliability investment studies performed by outside consultants and recent and historical returns on our plans’ assets adjusting our expected longterm rate of return 900 at september 30 2003 by 05 would change our estimated pension expense in 2004 by approximately 40 million for additional information about our pension plans see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements   impairment of longlived assets  we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts the amount of impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the estimated fair values in order to evaluate potential impairment as required by sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we group assets at the fleet type level the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on assumptions involving projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors in the markets in which these aircraft operate aircraft fair values are estimated by management using published sources appraisals and bids received from third parties as available changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of longlived assets see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements   recently issued accounting pronouncements on december 8 2003 president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act “medicare act” the medicare act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare and a 50 federal subsidy to sponsors of health care benefit plans in certain circumstances the impact of the medicare act is not reflected in our 2003 consolidated financial statements due to our september 30 measurement date for our postretirement plans which was prior to the enactment of this law the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” “fsp 1061” in january 2004 fsp 1061 permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a onetime election to defer accounting for the medicare act it also requires certain disclosures regarding the medicare act and is effective for financial statements issued after december 7 2003 in compliance with fsp 1061 in 2004 we will make a onetime election to reflect the estimated impact of the medicare act immediately or to defer recognition until specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy portion of the medicare act is issued in either case when specific guidance is issued we could be required to change previously reported financial information we are still evaluating the impact of the medicare act on our 2004 consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements market risks associated with financial instruments we have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our consolidated financial statements to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements management expects adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under sfas 133 to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and shareowners’ deficit equity the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel the economy as a whole or additional actions by management to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk for these and other reasons the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results   aircraft fuel price risk our results of operations may be significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel to manage this risk we periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our projected annual aircraft fuel requirements heating and crude oil prices have a highly correlated relationship to fuel prices making these derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of aircraft fuel we do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes at december 31 2003 we had hedged 32 of our projected aircraft fuel requirements for 2004 at an average hedge price per gallon of 7646¢ and none of our projected aircraft fuel requirements for 2005 or thereafter the fair values of our heating and crude oil derivative instruments were 97 million at december 31 2003 and 73 million at december 31 2002 a 10 decrease in the average annual price of heating and crude oil would have decreased the fair values of these instruments by 65 million at december 31 2003 51 in february 2004 we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their scheduled settlement dates as a result of these transactions we received 83 million in cash which represented the fair value of these contracts at the date of settlement in accordance with sfas 133 effective gains of 82 million will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the related fuel purchases which were being hedged are consumed and recognized in expense during 2004 these gains will then be recorded as a reduction in fuel expense on our consolidated statements of operations the ineffective portion of the hedges and the time value component of these contracts totaling 17 million will be recognized in the march 2004 quarter as a fair value adjustment of sfas 133 derivatives in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations we may enter into fuel hedge contracts in the future depending on certain conditions during 2003 aircraft fuel accounted for 14 of our total operating expenses based on our projected aircraft fuel consumption of approximately 25 billion gallons for 2004 a 10 rise in our jet fuel prices would increase our aircraft fuel expense by approximately 150 million in 2004 this analysis includes the effects of fuel hedging instruments in place at december 31 2003 for additional information regarding our aircraft fuel price risk management program see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements   interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our longterm debt obligations market risk associated with our longterm debt is the potential change in fair value resulting from a change in interest rates a 10 decrease in average annual interest rates would have increased the estimated fair value of our longterm debt by 682 million at december 31 2003 and 395 million at december 31 2002 a 10 increase in average annual interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest expense in 2003 for additional information on our longterm debt agreements see notes 4 and 6 of the

airline operations

         an important characteristic of deltas route network is its four hub
airports in atlanta cincinnati dallasft worth and salt lake city each of
these hub operations includes delta flights that gather and distribute traffic
from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities
and to other delta hubs deltas hub and spoke system also provides passengers
with access to deltas principal international gateways in atlanta and new york
 john f kennedy international airport jfk as briefly discussed below
other key characteristics of deltas route network include its alliances with
foreign airlines the delta connection program the delta shuttle songtm
deltas new lowfare service which will begin operations in april 2003 and
deltas proposed marketing alliance with continental airlines and northwest
airlines

         international alliances delta has formed bilateral and multilateral
marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve deltas access to
international markets these arrangements can include codesharing frequent
flyer benefits shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges joint
advertising and other marketing agreements

         deltas international codesharing agreements enable delta to market and
sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations under
codesharing arrangements delta and the foreign carriers publish their
respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation thereby
allowing delta and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft
rather than operating separate services with two aircraft these arrangements
typically allow delta to sell seats on the foreign carriers aircraft that are
marketed under deltas dl designator code and permit the foreign airline to
sell seats on deltas aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carriers
twoletter designator code as of march 1 2003 delta has codeshare
arrangements in effect with aerolitoral aeromexico air france and certain of
air frances affiliated carriers operating flights beyond paris air jamaica
alitalia british european china southern csa czech airlines el al israel
airlines korean air royal air maroc and south african airways

         delta aeromexico air france alitalia csa czech airlines and korean
air are members of the skyteam international airline alliance skyteam links the
route networks of the member airlines providing opportunities for increased
connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual
codesharing arrangements reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and
coordinated cargo operations in 2002 delta its european skyteam partners and
korean air received antitrust immunity from the us department of
transportation dot the grant of antitrust immunity enables delta and its
immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common
sales marketing and discount programs for customers

         delta connection program the delta connection program is deltas
regional carrier service which feeds traffic to deltas route system through
contracts with regional air carriers that operate flights serving passengers in
small and mediumsized cities it enables delta to increase the number of
flights in certain locations to better match capacity with demand and to
preserve its presence in smaller markets

         deltacontinentalnorthwest marketing alliance on august 22 2002
delta entered into a marketing alliance with continental airlines and northwest
airlines which includes mutual codesharing reciprocal frequent flyer and
airport lounge access arrangements deltas marketing relationship with
continental and northwest is designed to permit the carriers to retain their
separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic
and international connecting passengers using the three carriers route
networks the implementation of the marketing alliance is subject to a number of
conditions including approvals which have been obtained from the delta and
northwest pilot groups review by the us department of justice doj and the
dot and the consent of certain of the international airline partners of the
three airlines the doj reviewed the alliance arrangement pursuant to its
authority to enforce the antitrust laws and determined not to challenge the
alliance in january 2003 following the carriers decision to accept certain doj
conditions the dot completed its initial review of the marketing arrangements
in january 2003 and proposed six conditions for the alliance on february 28
2003 after consultations with the dot the carriers submitted a proposal in
which they accepted three of the dots conditions and proposed alternative
language for three other conditions on march 3 2003 the dot issued a notice
stating that it would consider the carriers proposed language and reach a
decision within 30 days on whether the alternate conditions are satisfactory
the current expectation is that the carriers should be in a position to



                                       5

complete the dot review process and obtain the international airline partner
consents in order to begin implementation of their marketing alliance during
2003

factors that impact demand for air travel

         demand for air travel is affected by various factors including
economic conditions fare levels terrorism fears international hostilities
airport security measures seasonality and weather conditions in addition
demand for air travel at particular airlines may be impacted from time to time
by among other things actual or threatened disruptions to operations due to
labor issues in general demand for air travel is higher in the june and
september quarters particularly in international markets because there is more
vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year due
to these and other factors operating results for an interim period are not
necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and operating
results for an historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating
results for a future period

regulatory matters

         the dot and the federal aviation administration faa exercise
regulatory authority over air transportation in the united states the dot has
authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for
airlines to provide domestic air transportation an air carrier which the dot
finds fit to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air
transportation including the carriage of passengers and cargo except for
constraints imposed by essential air service regulations which are applicable
to certain small communities airlines may terminate service to a city without
restriction

         the dot has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection
matters such as unfair or deceptive practices or methods of competition
advertising denied boarding compensation baggage liability and disabled
passenger transportation the dot also has authority to review certain joint
venture agreements between major carriers the faa has primary responsibility
for matters relating to air carrier flight operations including airline
operating certificates control of navigable air space flight personnel
aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety

         authority to operate international routes and international codesharing
arrangements are regulated by the dot and by the foreign governments involved
international route awards are also subject to the approval of the president of
the united states for conformance with national defense and foreign policy
objectives

         the transportation security administration which became a division of
the department of homeland security on march 1 2003 is responsible for certain
civil aviation security matters including passenger and baggage screening at
us airports


                                       6
page

         delta is also subject to various other federal state local and
foreign laws and regulations the doj has jurisdiction over airline competition
matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the
transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally
governed by the railway labor act environmental matters are regulated by
various federal state local and foreign governmental entities

fares and rates

         airlines are permitted to set ticket prices in most domestic and
international city pairs without governmental regulation and the industry is
characterized by significant price competition certain international fares and
rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the dot and the governments of the
foreign countries involved most of deltas tickets are sold by travel agents
and fares are subject to commissions overrides and discounts paid to travel
agents brokers and wholesalers

route authority

         deltas flight operations are authorized by certificates of public
convenience and necessity and to a limited extent by exemptions issued by the
dot the requisite approvals of other governments for international operations
are provided by bilateral agreements with or permits or approvals issued by
foreign countries because international air transportation is governed by
bilateral or other agreements between the united states and the foreign country
or countries involved changes in united states or foreign government aviation
policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements
diminish the value of deltas international route authorities or otherwise
affect deltas international operations bilateral agreements between the united
states and various foreign countries served by delta are subject to
renegotiation from time to time

         certain of deltas international route and codesharing authorities are
subject to periodic renewal requirements delta requests extension of these
authorities when and as appropriate while the dot usually renews temporary
authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable
level of service there is no assurance of this result dormant route authority
may not be renewed in some cases especially where another us carrier
indicates a willingness to provide service

competition

         delta faces significant competition with respect to domestic and
international routes services and fares all domestic routes served by delta
are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers and service over
virtually all of deltas domestic routes is highly competitive on most domestic
and international routes the company competes with at least one and usually
more than one scheduled passenger airline delta also competes with allcargo
carriers charter airlines and particularly on its shorter routes with surface
transportation


                                       7

         the continuing growth of lowcost carriers in the united states places
significant competitive pressures on delta and other network carriers a number
of lowcost carriers including southwest airlines airtran airways and jetblue
airways are offering increased seat capacity in deltas markets deltas
ability to compete effectively with lowcost carriers depends in part on its
ability to achieve operating costs per available seat mile unit costs that
are competitive with those carriers deltas unit costs are higher than those of
southwest airtran and jetblue

         international marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign
carriers such as the star alliance among united airlines lufthansa german
airlines and others the oneworld alliance among american airlines british
airways and others and the wings alliance between northwest airlines and
klmroyal dutch airlines have significantly increased competition in
international markets through marketing and codesharing arrangements with us
carriers foreign carriers have obtained access to interior us passenger
traffic similarly us carriers have increased their ability to sell
international transportation such as transatlantic services to and beyond
european cities through alliances with international carriers

         the airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition
if price reductions are not offset by increases in traffic or changes in the mix
of traffic that improve deltas passenger mile yield deltas operating results
will be adversely impacted

         delta regularly monitors competitive developments in the airline
industry and evaluates its strategic alternatives these strategic alternatives
include among other things internal growth codesharing arrangements
marketing alliances joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions deltas
evaluations involve internal analysis and where appropriate discussions with
third parties

airport access

         operations at three major us airports and certain foreign airports
served by delta are regulated by governmental entities through slot
allocations each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off
from the particular airport during a specified time period

         in the united states the faa currently regulates slot allocations at
jfk and la guardia airport in new york and ronald reagan national airport in
washington dc deltas operations at those three airports generally require
slot allocations under legislation enacted by congress slot rules will be
phased out at jfk and la guardia airport by 2007

        delta currently has sufficient slot authorizations to operate its
existing flights and has generally been able to obtain slots to expand its
operations and to change its schedules there is no assurance however that
delta will be able to obtain slots for these purposes in the future because
among other reasons slot allocations are subject to changes in governmental
policies


                                       8

possible legislation or dot regulation

         a number of congressional bills and proposed dot regulations have been
considered in recent years to address airline competition issues some of these
proposals would require large airlines with major operations at certain airports
to divest or make available to other airlines slots gates facilities and other
assets at those airports other measures would limit the service or pricing
responses of major carriers that appear to target new entrant airlines in
addition concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the dot and faa
to consider various proposals for access to certain airports including
congestionbased landing fees and programs that would regularly withdraw slots
from existing carriers and reallocate those slots either by lottery or auction
to the highest bidder or to carriers with little or no current presence at such
airports these proposals if enacted could negatively impact deltas existing
services and its ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines

         delta owns 40 of worldspan lp worldspan a delaware limited
partnership which operates and markets a computer reservation system crs and
related systems for the travel industry northwest airlines and american

1      net of fuel hedge gains under deltas fuel hedging program

         aircraft fuel expense decreased 7 in 2002 compared to 2001 total
gallons consumed decreased 5 mainly due to capacity reductions the average
fuel price per gallon fell 2 to 6694cent deltas fuel cost is shown net of
fuel hedge gains of 136 million for 2002 and 299 million for 2001
approximately 56 and 58 of deltas aircraft fuel requirements were hedged
during 2002 and 2001 respectively

         deltas aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material
protection against price increases or for assured availability of supplies the
company purchases most of its aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under
contracts which establish the price based on various market indices delta also
purchases aircraft fuel on the spot market from offshore sources and under
contracts which permit the refiners to set the price and give the company the
right to terminate upon short notice if the price is unacceptable

         delta periodically enters into heating and crude oil derivative
contracts to manage the risk associated with changes in aircraft fuel prices
information regarding deltas fuel hedging program is set forth under aircraft
fuel price risk on pages 2324 and in notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements on pages 3941 of deltas 2002 annual report
to shareowners and is incorporated by reference

        although delta is currently able to obtain adequate supplies of jet
fuel it is not possible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft
fuel political disruptions in oil producing countries changes in government
policy concerning aircraft fuel production transportation or marketing changes
in aircraft fuel production capacity environmental concerns and other
unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price
increases in the future

employee matters

         railway labor act deltas relations with labor unions in the united
states are governed by the railway labor act under the railway labor act a
labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is
required to file with the national mediation board nmb an application
alleging a representation dispute along with authorization cards signed by at
least 35 of the employees in that craft or class the nmb then investigates the
dispute


                                       10
page

and if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of
authorization cards conducts an election to determine whether to certify the
labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class
under the nmbs usual rules a labor union will be certified as the
representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50 of
those employees vote for union representation

         under the railway labor act a collective bargaining agreement between
an airline and a labor union does not expire but instead becomes amendable as
of a stated date either party may request the nmb to appoint a federal mediator
to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement if no
agreement is reached in mediation the nmb may determine at any time that an
impasse exists and offer binding arbitration if either party rejects binding
arbitration a 30day cooling off period begins at the end of this 30day
period the parties may engage in self help unless the president of the
united states appoints a presidential emergency board peb to investigate and
report on the dispute the appointment of a peb maintains the status quo for
an additional 60 days if the parties do not reach agreement during this period
the parties may then engage in self help self help includes among other
things a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the
collective bargaining agreement by the airline congress and the president have
the authority to prevent self help by enacting legislation which among other
things imposes a settlement on the parties

        collective bargaining at december 31 2002 delta asa and comair had a
total of 75100 fulltime equivalent employees approximately 18 of these
employees are represented by unions the following table presents certain

         pilot furloughs the collective bargaining agreement between delta and
the air line pilots association international alpa the union representing
delta pilots generally provides that no pilot on the seniority list as of july
1 2001 will be furloughed unless the furlough is caused by a circumstance
beyond deltas control as defined in that agreement in april 2002 an
arbitrator upheld deltas right to furlough up to 1400 pilots on the basis that
the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting reduction in
passenger traffic constituted a circumstance beyond deltas control as set out
in the collective bargaining agreement the arbitrator retained jurisdiction
over this matter to consider any issues that might arise regarding the companys
plans to continue the furloughs or its obligation to implement reasonable
mechanisms for recalling furloughed pilots if the conditions existing as of
september 11 2001 were ameliorated to an extent that exceeded deltas original
expectations on february 13 2003 the arbitrator issued a supplemental
opinion ruling 1 that furloughs will be capped at 1060 the number of pilots
currently furloughed 2 that delta will not have to begin recalling any of the
existing furloughed pilots until system traffic exceeds preseptember 11 2001
levels and 3 that the recall schedule will be subject to the companys
training capacity while this ruling will result in the retention of some pilots
in excess of its needs delta believes the ruling will not have a material
adverse effect on delta

rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise
abatement procedures so long as such procedures do not interfere unreasonably
with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system
it generally provides that local noise restrictions on stage 3 aircraft first
effective after october 1 1990 require faa approval while delta has had
sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the
past deltas operations could be adversely impacted if locallyimposed
regulations become more restrictive or widespread

         the united states environmental protection agency the epa is
authorized to regulate aircraft emissions deltas aircraft comply with the
applicable epa standards

         in february 1998 the epa and the faa signed a memorandum of agreement
moa to develop a voluntary process with the airline industry to reduce
emissions that lead to ozone formation the moa includes a proposal with a
voluntary engine modification program to reduce emissions from aircraft engines
as a result of the moa air carriers the epa the faa and local and state
regulators are evaluating potential options for emission reductions from airport
activities including aircraft engine emissions reductions and
alternativefueled ground service equipment but no conclusion or agreement has
been reached in addition to the moa delta has agreed to reduce emissions at
certain airports by utilizing alternativefueled ground service equipment

         in april 2001 miamidade county filed a lawsuit which is titled
miamidade county florida v advance cargo services inc et al in florida
circuit court against 17 defendants including delta alleging responsibility
for past and future environmental cleanup costs at the miami international
airport the county also provided notice to over 200 other potentially
responsible parties seeking to recover past and future cleanup costs the county
is continuing to investigate and remediate various environmental conditions at
the airport at this time it is not possible to reasonably estimate deltas
potential exposure in this matter due to a number of issues including
uncertainties regarding the contamination at the airport the extent of
remediation required and the countys potential recovery from responsible
parties delta is vigorously defending the lawsuit

         delta has been identified by the epa as a potentially responsible party
a prp with respect to certain superfund sites and has entered into consent
decrees regarding some of these sites deltas alleged disposal volume at each
of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all prps at
each site delta is aware of soil andor ground water contamination present on
its current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports to address this
contamination the company has a program in place to investigate and if
appropriate remediate these sites delta believes that the resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
statements

frequent flyer program

         delta has a frequent flyer program the skymilesr program offering
incentives to increase travel on delta this program allows participants to earn
mileage for travel awards by flying on delta delta connection carriers and
participating airlines mileage credit may also be earned by using certain
services offered by program partners such as credit card companies hotels car
rental agencies telecommunication services and internet services in addition
delta has programs under which individuals and companies may purchase mileage
credits delta reserves the right to terminate the program with six months
advance notice and to change the programs terms and conditions at any time
without notice

         mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on
delta and participating airline partners for membership in deltas crown room
club and for other program partner awards travel awards are subject to certain
transfer restrictions and capacitycontrolled seating in some cases blackout
dates may apply miles earned prior to may 1 1995 do not expire so long as
delta has a frequent flyer program miles earned or purchased on or after may 1
1995 will not expire as long as at least once every three years the
participant 1 takes a qualifying flight on delta or a delta connection
carrier 2 earns miles through one of deltas program partners or 3 redeems
miles for any program award

        delta accounts for its frequent flyer program obligations by recording a
liability for the estimated incremental cost of travel awards the company
expects to be redeemed the estimated incremental cost associated with a travel
award does not include any contribution to overhead or profit such incremental
cost is based on deltas system average cost per passenger for fuel food and
other direct passenger costs delta does not record a liability for mileage
earned by participants who have not reached the level to become eligible for a
free travel award delta believes this is appropriate because the large majority
of these participants are not expected to


                                       13
page

earn a travel award delta does not record a liability for the expected
redemption of miles for nontravel awards since the cost of these awards to
delta is negligible

         delta estimated the potential number of roundtrip travel awards
outstanding under its frequent flyer program to be 137 million 131 million
and 122 million at december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively of these
travel awards delta expected that approximately 100 million 96 million and
92 million respectively would be redeemed at december 31 2002 2001 and
2000 delta had recorded a liability for these awards of 228 million 226
million and 199 million respectively the difference between the roundtrip
awards outstanding and the awards expected to be redeemed is the estimate based
on historical data of awards which will 1 never be redeemed or 2 be
redeemed for something other than award travel

         frequent flyer program participants flew 28 million 24 million and
23 million award roundtrips on delta in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively
these roundtrips accounted for approximately 9 8 and 7 of the total
passenger miles flown for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively delta believes that
the relatively low percentage of passenger miles flown by skymiles members
traveling on program awards and the restrictions applied to travel awards
minimize the displacement of revenue passengers

civil reserve air fleet program

         delta participates in the civil reserve air fleet craf program
which permits the us military to use the aircraft and crew resources of
participating us airlines during airlift emergencies national emergencies or
times of war delta has agreed to make available under the craf program during
the period october 1 2002 through september 30 2003 up to 100 of its

         information relating to deltas aircraft fleet is set forth under
deltas aircraft fleet on page 70 and in notes 7 and 9 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements on pages 4750 of deltas 2002 annual report
to shareowners and is incorporated by reference

ground facilities

         delta leases most of the land and buildings that it occupies the
companys largest aircraft maintenance base various computer cargo flight
kitchen and training facilities and most of its principal offices are located at
or near hartsfield atlanta international airport in atlanta georgia on land
leased from the city of atlanta generally under longterm leases delta owns a
portion of its principal offices its atlanta reservations center and other
improved and unimproved real property in atlanta as well as a limited number of
radio transmitting and receiving sites and certain other facilities

         delta leases ticket counter and other terminal space operating areas
and air cargo facilities in most of the airports which it serves these leases
generally run for periods of less than one year to thirty years or more and
often contain provisions for periodic adjustment of lease rates at most
airports which it serves delta has entered into use agreements which provide
for the nonexclusive use of runways taxiways and other facilities landing
fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and
weight of aircraft the company also leases aircraft maintenance facilities at
certain airports these leases generally require delta to pay the cost of
providing operating and maintaining such facilities in addition to its atlanta
maintenance base deltas other major aircraft maintenance facilities are
located at cincinnatinorthern kentucky international airport dallasft worth
international airport and salt lake city international airport delta leases
marketing ticket and reservations offices in certain major cities which it
serves these leases are generally for shorter terms than the airport leases
additional information relating to deltas ground facilities is set forth in
note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 47 of
deltas 2002 annual report to shareowners and is incorporated by reference

        in recent years some airports have increased or sought to increase the
rates charged to airlines to levels that in the airlines opinion are
unreasonable the extent to which such charges are limited by statute or
regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject
to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the dot if the
limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge
such charges is restricted the rates charged by airports to airlines may
increase substantially

         the city of atlanta with the support of delta and other airlines has
begun a ten year capital improvement program the cip at hartsfield atlanta
international airport implementation of the cip should increase the number of
flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays the cip
includes among other things a new approximately 9000 foot fullservice runway
targeted for completion in may 2006 related airfield improvements additional
terminal and gate capacity new cargo and other support facilities and roadway
and


                                       15
page

other infrastructure improvements if fully implemented the cip is currently
estimated to cost approximately 54 billion the cip runs through 2010 with
individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different times a
combination of federal grants passenger facility charge revenues increased
user rentals and fees and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay
cip costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds there is no
assurance the cip will be implemented on schedule and within budget or that it
will be fully implemented failure to implement certain portions of the cip in a
timely manner could adversely impact deltas operations at hartsfield atlanta
international airport

         during 2001 delta entered into lease and financing agreements with the
massachusetts port authority massport for the redevelopment and expansion of
terminal a at bostons logan international airport the completion of this
project will enable delta to consolidate all of its domestic operations at that
airport into one location construction began in the june 2002 quarter and is
scheduled to be completed during 2005 project costs will be funded with 498
million in proceeds from special facilities revenue bonds issued by massport on
august 16 2001 delta agreed to pay the debt service on the bonds under a
longterm lease agreement with massport and issued a guarantee to the bond
trustee covering the payment of the debt service on the bonds additional
information about these bonds is set forth in note 6 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements on pages 4346 of deltas 2002 annual report

the defendants and certain other airlines conspired with delta in violation of
section 1 of the sherman act to restrain competition and assist delta in fixing
and maintaining anticompetitive prices for air passenger service to and from its
atlanta and cincinnati hubs and 2 that delta violated section 2 of the
sherman act by exercising monopoly power to establish such prices in an
anticompetitive or exclusionary manner the complaint asserts that for purposes
of plaintiffs damages claims the purported plaintiff class consists of all
persons who purchased a delta fullfare ticket between june 11 1995 and the
present on routes 1 that start or end at deltas hubs in atlanta or
cincinnati 2 on which delta has over a 50 market share 3 that are longer
than 150 miles and 4 that have total annual traffic of over 30000
passengers

claims under sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act with respect to us airways
pricing practices at its pittsburgh and charlotte hubs us airways hubs the
